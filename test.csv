In this stunning biopic, where Portman flexes her acting muscles as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, proves to be a testament of her incredible talent. Its a film driven by a lead performance, that is anchored by sheer power.
'Jackie' Synopsis: Following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy fights through grief and trauma to regain her faith, console her children, and define her husband's historic legacy.
Director Pablo Larraín brings a disturbing true-story on celluloid, that covers theme of love, loss & power. We watch Jackie struggle with the surroundings around her, following the assassination of her President Husband. And I must tell you, the journey has been told with gut-wrenching bleakness. The narrative is no-holds-barred & what we see throughout the film, is a women in deep pain.
Noah Oppenheim's Screenplay is top-notch. Its arresting as well as its disturbing. Pablo Larraín's Direction is fantastic. He has handled this biographical-drama with precision. Cinematography is brilliant. Editing is razor-crisp, keeping the narrative tight in its 99-minutes running-time. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Mica Levi's Score is super.
Performance-Wise: As mentioned right from my summary, Portman is Mesmerizing. Its a tour-de-force performance, that ranks amongst the best of 2016. Of the supporting cast, Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy & Greta Gerwig as Nancy Tuckerman, are first-rate, yet again. And John Hurt as Father Richard McSorley, is remarkable in a cameo. Others lend good support.
On the whole, 'Jackie' is definitely a must see. It finds one of the most talented actresses of our times, at her finest hour. Go watch!""Though this film deserves a very long review, as I have so much to say about it, what more needs to be said than has already been mentioned by the nation's critics, who have contributed to The Dark Knight's whopping 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Some are saying it's better than Batman Begins, director Chris Nolan's first film in this new Batman series. I disagree, but only because I think that film is a lot better than some critics remember it. I do think, however, that The Dark Knight is just as masterful, and since I consider both to be nearly flawless enough to give them each five stars, it's high enough praise to say this new film is the rare sequel that lives up to the original.
Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker? Everything you've heard, all of the praise and hype? All true. His is a riveting, terrifying, and darkly hilarious portrayal of the ultimate villain, and it's a completely original take on the character. Everyone will be talking about his performance, as well they should be, but I hope they won't lose sight of how terrific the acting is across the board. Christian Bale continues to impress as the best Batman/Bruce Wayne ever. Since he was so well established last time, he's given slightly less screen time here, but he's equally compelling as a man pushed to his limits.
Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman have less to do, but every second they're on screen, they're terrific. Gary Oldman continues to show that he's just as compelling playing good guys as bad ones; his Commissioner Gordon is a pillar of virtue. Maggie Gyllenhall (Stranger Than Fiction) steps in for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. While I'm one of the apparently few people who didn't mind Mrs. Cruise in the first film, Gyllenhall adds a bit more life to the character. Finally Aaron Eckhart gives a subtle and layered performance as Gotham D.A. Harvey Dent. If Ledger wasn't stealing the show, it'd be Eckhart's acting everyone would be talking about.
The action: terrific (a mid-movie chase scene stands out in my mind). The screenplay: just like Begins, it's full of fantastic moral investigations, fleshed-out characters, and plenty of surprises which I wouldn't dare reveal here. Like the first film, this is dark and scary, but with a lining of humanity and just a touch of humor. The direction is even better this time (thank you, Mr. Nolan, for allowing us to actually see the fights). Don't believe those reviews which say they don't know how this slipped by with a PG-13 rating; it is intense, and the Joker is brutal and horrific, but just like a great Hitchcock movie, the actual gruesome stuff occurs in your imagination, not on-screen. There's not any blood that I can remember, though there are some freaky images vis- a-vis the villains' physical appearance and the sight of some corpses.
That being said, this is not a movie to take kids to. Just because you don't see a lot of gore, doesn't mean it isn't terrifying. If you're afraid of clowns, buckle up. Pushed to his limits, Batman gets mean. I mean Jack Bauer mean! At any rate, this is a terrific film; a crime/morality drama first, an action thriller second, and a comic book movie third. It isn't flawless, but the minor complaints are so nit-picky that I've no need to mention them here. Sorry Wall- E, but you're gonna have to pass the crown of year's best film over. The Dark Knight is king, and his jester is chilling.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I may be a little biased towards Zootopia because it is a Disney/Pixar film, which I tend to love. However, since I didn't grow up with this movie, it didn't have the nostalgia effect on me. Still, Disney lives up to its standards. A movie about the importance of believing in yourself and not falling prey to stereotypes and prejudices, this is a great one for both the kids and adults. The kids will love the fun colors, humor, and action scenes. The adults will appreciate the reference to Frozen by Chief Bogo and when Duke Weaselton (another Frozen reference) shows that he's selling movies that haven't even come out yet like Mewona, Floatzen 2, and Giraffic referring the movies Moana (2016), Frozen 2 (2018), and Gigantic (2018). This movie, like many Disney/ Pixar movies, has so many Easter eggs, it's awesome for big Disney fans. If you're not a Disney fan, however, I'd still recommend this movie to you. It shows how we all fall victim to stereotypes and discrimination, but also stresses that we should try to avoid them. In addition, this movie had my friend and I rolling on the floor laughing. For a kids' movie, the humor is pretty good. I feel like it's easier for most of us to understand Nick Wilde's character better than Judy Hopps's character because Nick's a bit more realistic, if not a bit pessimistic. He's been bullied like many people, but his big flaw is he let that bullying when he was like, 9, follow him until he's about 32. He decides because of that one incident that he will be a sly fox, like everyone expects him to be, instead of what he wants to be. It's never made clear what Nick wanted to do when he grew up, but he seemed pretty happy as a cop in the end.""If your primary expectation in an action movie is to get entertained then this one is highly recommended. Collide is an enjoyable action flick with solid performances by all main actors, including Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley. The film was shot in nice locations in Germany, features great cars and suspenseful car chases. For the plot, yes there were some mistakes, but not at a disturbing level. I also liked the twist in the end.
Considering the movie's low ratings and some of the crushing reviews the overall quality delivered was a real surprise to me. I considered it much more entertaining then all of the recent mutant/superhero crap made in Hollywood.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** i agree with everything your initial reviewer has said. i loved it. would watch it again. beautiful photography and locations. i am a fan of old movies and this film was spot on. even brad pitt was convincing. i find he often is if partnered with a good actor. she of course, was terrific. authentic London blitz and France ww2 scenes. a romantic le carre style spy thriller. it is a good film. we don't get enough of this type of film. with an ageing population filmmakers are missing the point. drama based on real incidents with a mixture of humour/romance/thriller or charming romance/thriller are very popular and we see so few of them. why are all films aimed at the young? do you imagine the over 60's are too frail to leave the house? remember, we are the old 50. we have time, money and don't party - we dine out and go to films. we are more likely to visit a cinema as we grew up going to the movies before videos and dvds were invented. you have a captive audience and you don't write for them. this is a good site. thanks for the opportunity to review this film. by the way La La Land was boring. where was the spark, the music, the choreographer.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I had a free movie ticket so I decided to see Underworld: Blood Wars, even though I really didn't like the last movie. This one is worth the price of a free ticket, so take that as you will.
Grade: A- Numerical Grade: 9.1/10
Plot: 7/10 The writers seemed to have remembered what made Underworld so great: Death Dealers killing Lycans, Lycans killing Death Dealers, with a very minor story connecting the fighting. This is both good and bad because while the story was a tiny bit weak, at least it was solid enough to make you enjoy the movie. The actions scenes were well done, you cared enough about the characters that you weren't bored, and (thankfully), they seemed to end the franchise.
Character Development: 8/10 Selene was back in form in this movie, no longer moping over Michael, though she still missed him. But she was back to major kick-ass form, especially at the end. Semira was probably the best villain I've seen in this type of movie in a long time, and she really added to the overall feel of the movie. David was okay as a fight-partner for Selene, but he wasn't great. He worked, though. The Lycans and Death Dealers also had good motivation and you could see where they were coming from and why they were doing what they were doing.
Director: 9/10 First movie by Anna Foerster that I remember seeing, and she did a really good job, giving me a good Underworld movie that I won't mind adding to my collection when it comes out on digital download. Don't think this movie deserves Steelbook, though--none of the Underworld movies do.
Casting: 9/10 I liked everyone in this movie, other than Tobias Menzies, who really did not fit the role of Marius. Charles Dance was perfect in his role as Thomas, one of the elder vampires. Kate Beckinsale was stunning, as usual. Theo James was...well...Theo James.
Acting: 9/10 Everyone pretty much played their part exactly as you expected they would, except Tobias Menzies who just didn't seem to really care. He was about the only person who didn't give it an effort.
Cinematography: 10/10 The film was beautiful, Gothic and eerie and dark, very much like a classic vampire movie with modern vampires. Brilliant!
Music: 10/10 Music fit the movie perfectly.
Pacing: 10/10 Didn't check my watch once. Movie flowed well, didn't drag for too long, and the action was paced well throughout.
Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Loved the look of the sets, loved the costumes. Those are two things these movies have always done well.
Enjoyment: 9/10 I did enjoyed this movie for what it was. It was not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but I do like the Underworld movies overall. They have problems, but the overall story is good. If you like the Underworld movies, give this one a watch at some point, even if not in theaters. If you hated the movies, avoid this one.
Ranking: I was surprised when I ranked the Underworld movies.
Underworld: Blood Wars Underworld: Evolution Underworld: Awakening Underworld: Rise of the Lycans Underworld""Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Milo Gibson, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths.
Based on the incredible true story, WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.
It's taken me a while to digest Mel Gibson's brutal epic Hacksaw Ridge, roaring with fire and an undying courage shown in Garfield's deeply rooted portrayal of Desmond T. Doss, but at this point after sitting on time for a moment, I can safely say that this is one of most carefully crafted war films I have ever had the pleasure to, in some ways, endure.
Andrew Garfield's performance in this film is bitterly convincing, gripping the viewer with a biting display of emotion shown within the conscientious objector. A background of Doss' life is shown within the first 20 minutes, which aids his character and helps the viewer connect with his many decisions that occur during the heavily textured battle, leading to saving 75 lives on the front line. Not only does Garfield provide an emotional core, he goes through all kinds of hell, crawling between the gruesome display of the fallen and wounded.
It would be all for nothing, however, without Gibson's skillful direction. He and cinematographer Simon Duggan capture the Art, Special Effects and Stunt department's hard work with eyes of an eagle, utilising smart camera set-ups that assist the unravelling chaos and destruction unfolding around the cast.
The supporting cast of Luke Bracey, Richard Pyros, Jacob Warner, Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn are truly wonderful. Each individual provides a delightful back-and-fourth between themselves and Garfield. Vaughn breaks from his comedic persona (almost entirely) and shines light on a new side to his acting abilities. Many of his scenes are smartly written and engaging, whilst finding the perfect time to improvise his lines, adding a much-needed comic relief. Hugo Weaving is incredible in one of his best roles yet. Delivering a powerhouse performance that ties with Garfield's, showcasing several layers of hate, sadness and regret, detailed beautifully in his fine acting.
Original music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is satisfactory, though missing something of great importance; distraught emotion. It's great at filling the gaps with heroic themes, but I never felt moved by the score in any huge way. In the final moments of the film I do admit to have felt hopeful and 'pumped' but I thought the score had an absence of fear and angst. This could be due to Gibson's direction though, as ultimately the director has the final say. However, I believe the space is filled with an impeccably thorough bed of sound, expertly created by the Sound Department and adeptly mixed and edited, earning 2 Academy Award nominations.
The battle sequences are intricate and complex, captured beautifully in-camera and driven by highly intense and scary situations that spring up out of nowhere. It's a tough experience to get through, but it's undeniably well put together, seriously powerful and absolutely worth it.
Verdict; Hacksaw Ridge is riveting and bathed in gore, however, underneath the brutality is a fine true story of survival and heroism.
Hacksaw Ridge, 9/10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Great work by whole team of Snowden. There efforts paid off and i hope what they want to show, exactly that have been shown. This is the first time i am writing a review for a movie. It's worth to write a review for a guy who has put lot of efforts and still fighting for it. Yep it's sad to see getting mixed reviews. I can't comment on public review as everyone has there own perception and own thinking, how they look movie. I look every particular scene and i take all positive things. I loved the role played by Joseph and he has nailed it. Thanks all for putting lot of efforts and making such a nice movie inspired by true events.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Of course it's predictable, there wouldn't have been a movie based on the book if it wasn't. Hollywood (Australian style) isn't in the business of not making money. I loved Nicole Kidman's role & especially her ""big"" scene where she discloses her reason for adopting the children. She was brilliant while delivering those lines. Rooney Mara was super in her role also, as the girlfriend who encourages Saroo to find his family, but I would like to know if she really stuck around in the end like she said she would. I'm not a big fan of subtitles and that's one of the reasons I didn't give it a 10. Another reason was there was some disjointedness with the dream/reality sequences that had me wondering several times what was going on, then the film would come back around and move on. Still, the little kid was marvelous and sucked me in completely. His angst was real. Knowing what happened to his brother Gudru (?) at the end was sad but, helped bring the film full circle. Dev Patel is a wonder and I hope he continues to get more roles in big films as he well deserves them. He has grown into a fine young man/actor. Be sure to bring tissues.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I don't know why, but watching the film ""Passengers"" I have raised in my soul nostalgic memories about the album, ""Еlectric Light Orchestra"" (""ELO"") ""Time"" (1981), the theme songs on which the fate of a man caught with the help of a time machine in the year 2095 and are not able to come back. I especially remember the song ""21st Century Man"", the meaning of which is that despite all the great technical achievements of mankind of the 21st century, they themselves do not make people happier, and even on the contrary, make more aware of their loneliness:
""Fly across the city, rise upon the land,
You can do most anything,
Now you are twenty first century man.
You should be so happy, you should be so glad.
So why are you so lonely, you twenty first century man?""
In my opinion, the main theme in ""Passengers"" is the theme of human loneliness. How it is shown in the film, deserves a separate description, but to avoid spoilers let me just say that at all times the universal, and yet the only cure for this epidemic of our age is the Love, and it is capitalized. This is light feeling that had test heroes Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, it helped them better understand themselves and defined the whole meaning of their lives. No matter in what conditions was their fateful meeting, the important thing is what impact it has had on the future of Aurora lane and Jim Preston, through some painful doubts, fears and uneasiness were the heroes on the way to the realization of a common destiny that bound them aboard the space ship ""Avalon"". I believe it is the desire to live ""here and now"" in the earthly present, not ""someday"" in the future transcendental determined the final mutual decision of the lovers.
As for the actors, I can say that they excellently managed with their images. Chris Pratt was able to show courageous and at the same time, not alien to romance man, which by the fate, or maybe, by the chance, took, perhaps, the most difficult decision of his life. I respect and love Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I don't think that her roles as a strong and independent heroines somehow spoil her, on the contrary, it perfectly reflects her character and willpower. Here, as in ""The Hunger Games"", the actress showed herself from the best side, performing the role of a young writer feeling a certain emptiness in life and seeking to fill the dream of a new life. But, as often happened in life, what we seek is sometimes much closer than we think, it is enough to look inside yourself and look around, and we understood what is our main earthly value, not illusory, though very attractive and alluring.
A film for romantics and those who love and appreciate a movie that raises questions about major life issues such as loneliness, finding yourself and your place in this world, and, of course, about love as a unique way of coping with reality and at the same time to escape from it.
""When you feel your ship is sinking,
When you feel your heart is breaking,
Hold on tight to your dream""! (""ELO"",""Hold On Tight To Your Dream"")""A long-time passion project for Martin Scorsese, which he developed for over 26 years, 'Silence' has finally come alive. And to its fortune, Scorsese delivers one of the most powerful ever based on Faith, Humanity & God Itself. This is a Brutal & Thought-Provoking Film, that questions our existence & the religious beliefs we're surrounded by.
'SIlence' Synopsis: Two priests travel to Japan in an attempt to locate their mentor and propagate Catholicism. While there, they are faced by severe protest & torture.
'Silence' left me disturbed & thought provoked. Scorsese delivers such a brutal tale of people driven by faith & later being tortured for their beliefs. The Japanese torture & brutalize the Christians as they try to propagate Catholicism. To be honest, you need a very strong stomach to absorb 'Silence', its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. The goings-on are very intense & at times, brutal.
Scorsese doesn't shy away from showing what has to be shown. This tale of faith & the violent prosecution that follows, is told with relentlessness. And by the time you reach its final-act, where a shocking twist unfolds though an character, you're bound to be shocked. 'Silence' truly questions humanity & how faith can be questioned too. And above all, it questions God with pain & sorrow.
Scorsese's Direction is remarkable. He brings his passion to life with gut-wrenching intensity. Without a shed of doubt, 'Silence' finds him at his peak! Jay Cocks & Scorsese's Screenplay, Based upon the 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō. is frightening, but arresting all through. Rodrigo Prieto's Cinematography is marvelous. Thelma Schoonmaker's Editing is well-done, even though the film runs for nearly 3 hours (162-minutes to be precise). Kim Allen Kluge & Kathryn Kluge's Score is perfect.
Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues, the protagonist, takes upon the challenge Scorsese puts him in & in return, delivers a moving performance. His breakdowns when he witnesses brutality on the name of his faith, appear real & haunting. Adam Driver as Francisco Garupe, does well in a relatively smaller role. Liam Neeson as Father Cristóvão Ferreira, enters the film pretty late, but commands the screen. He's fabulous! Issey Ogata as the inquisitor, the antagonist, is fantastic. He is a scene-stealer! Others lend great support.
On the whole, 'Silence' is a Must See! Scorsese's unrelenting approach to his passion project, dominates in every frame!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children was an American movie about a boy called Jake Portman (Asa Butterfeild), who's Grandfather (Terrance Stamp) told him stories of the home for special he lived in.

On the first visit Jake finds out a bomb destroyed the house and on his second visit he meets Emma Bloom (Ella Purnell), Olive Abroholos Elephanta (Lauren McCrostie) and Millard Nulling (Cameron King).Jake meets the other children, The Twins (Thomas and Joseph Orwell), Claire Densmore (Raphiella Chapman), Bronwyn Bruntley (Pixie Davis), Fiona Fraunefeld (Georgia Pemberton, Hugh Apiston (Milo Parker), Horace Somnusson (Hayden Keylor Stone) and Enoch O'Conor (Finlay McMillian) and Miss Peregrine (Eva Green), the Bird.""I liked it but...
There was too much detracting from what could've been a good story. Perhaps too many characters. When there's a large cast, it's difficult to give each player enough screen time so much of it had to be condensed into a few moments voice-over and a brief scene of his/her origin.
They say you can't tell the layers without a program but in this one, even with the explanation of who everyone is, it's never clear why they're doing what they're doing. This is a movie in which the bad guys are bad and the good guys badder, but the so-called villains have their own set of morals while the good guys have none. (Naturally the ruthless are the ones in power.) While I liked the characters, the plot...was there really one? Since this was supposed to (apparently) be after the story in which Superman is killed, these characters are ""recruited"" to take his place. Having nowhere seen or heard of a movie about that event--did I miss it? Does it exist?--the viewers are subjected to a brief shot of a funeral cortege as explanation, and that's all.
The plot is confusing. Muddled would be a kind way to describe it. It seems to go in one direction, then abruptly switch to another. The ""mission"" is said to be one thing, it quickly deteriorates into something else, though exactly what isn't clear, except that the Witch is involved. Adding to the confusion, there are flashbacks inserted in such a way they seem part of the action until they dissolve back into the present. Frankly, I'd liked to have seen more of the Joker. He seemed the most ""sane"" part of the story, and that's saying an ironic lot.
While the various members of the suicide squad are good and the brief explanations of their backstories helpful, though Deadshot's is the only one explored in true depth, this movie was a disappointment because it seemed aimless, merely an excuse for explosive special effects and merely introducing characters, as if a ""trial run"" to see how audiences accepted them, perhaps in preparation for a movie with a true plot in which they again star.
Score 8 stars for characterization; it would've been 10 if there had been some reason in all this chaos.
This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.""I saw this film tonight because there's a lot of great movies out there But I'm not good with violence, so i was told this was the least violent of the three. (other choices were 'silence' and 'hacksaw ridge') I was very impressed by what I saw. I don't know all the facts, but i do know liberties were taken as Mark Wahlberg's character is an amalgamation of a bunch of people, so how much else of this movie is true, I'm not sure. I'm also not sure why this film hasn't been a bigger hit. interestingly enough, i just so happened to have dinner plans with my friend after this film, who is a boston native. she she says she believes the film hasn't done well because it's too soon, that she or no one she knows will go see it yet because it's too emotional. I can see that because the film WAS very emotional, striking a good balance between action and heartfelt drama. you feel a lump in your throat the whole time at all the devastation. Personally, I thought it was a very good film, and highly recommended.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** My eight year old granddaughter could hardly contain herself when I asked her if she wanted to see the movie. All through the picture she would poke me when something struck her as unusually cute or funny. We caught the 3-D version which was well done. I don't get to see that many so it's cool to see how the animators make their characters come off the page so to speak.
I for one am pretty poor at recognizing the actors behind the voices in animated flicks like this and I wouldn't have guessed a single one here. With that in mind, I thought all the non-professional singers who lent their talent did a pretty good job. Seth MacFarlane was a hoot as Mike the Sinatra Mouse with a nice rendition of 'My Way', and I couldn't get over Scarlett Johansson rocking it out as her character Ash, or Reese Witherspoon as Rosita. They all sounded good with strong singing voices.
What gets me as I read the negative reviews on this board for what's nominally a kid's picture is how nasty some of the comments are. One particularly deranged reviewer goes into specific detail on how each of the singing animals performing in Buster Moon's talent show represents a nominee of President Donald Trump's cabinet. That would be especially amazing foresight for writer and director Garth Jennings who started on the project early in 2014, with an almost completed film screened as a work in progress at the Toronto Film Festival back in September of 2016.
Well, not to get sidetracked, but this film is generally fun entertainment for the entire family with an important message of perseverance for youngsters on working toward completing their goals. That one's best exemplified by Tori Kelly's Meena - ""Don't let fear stop you from doing the things you love.""""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I feel like this perfectly captures the ambiance of the books. The characters, the feeling, the overall haunting fog makes it magical. Jim Carrey gives one of the best performances in his career-in fact it is a marvelously star-studded cast - and the children were perfect. This has held up incredibly well and I watch it still. Even more to its credit, the show is unbearably bad and so the movie brings round the good feels again. I really feel like it's time to stop tying to re-make everything (and thus ruining it) and maybe just do a wicked sequel. I would be more comfortable watching Carrey reprise this amazing role than having it shattered and stomped on.""Bye Bye Man was a triumph. Every second of it was amazing. I have seen a lot of good movies but this movie takes the cake it was fantastic. I thought it was going to be scary , but it was not and for a horror movie that would hurt it, but for some reason it helped this movie. My favorite line from the movie is Don't think it, don't say it, don't think it, don't say it. There was not a dull moment it was non stop action and thrills and chills it was just fantastic. I wish it would never end but sadly it ended after 96 minutes and that was not long enough for a movie like this.
Parents this movie is rated PG-13 and it defiantly deserved the PG-13 rating because it was intense very intense but very very good. I loved this movie so much that when I get older I may even get a bye bye man tattoo.
Don't THINK IT Don't SAY IT Don't THINK IT Don't SAY IT.""***This Preview does NOT contain any SPOILERS***
I've seen a lot of Disney movies recently and I must say that I am worried. For what I have experienced these days it seems that Disney has an off period; They produce a certain amount of movies, but there are too few with a original story line and well-developed and characters. For me Zootropolis belongs to that last part. The characters are well-developed and the story line is quite original and far less predictable, which is very surprising for Disney especially during this time.
The thing is, Disney wants to earn money... -Ohh, sorry I made a mistake- Disney wants to earn a lot of money, however the amount of original ideas is running out, so they keep producing cash grabs(successful, but unoriginal, unprofessional etc.), which is now more than ever. Although I do admit that it is very hard to come up with something original these days. Luckily they still manage to produce golden eggs, like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, WALL-E, Monsters, Inc. and in this case Zootropolis. It is a really good movie and far more better than I expected. The very reason why I love Zootropolis is that it is not only original and unpredictable, it also fits perfectly to daily life. I really do hope that Disney will continue producing more movies like this instead of making cash grabs, which in my opinion does not deserve any credit.
***This Preview does NOT contain any SPOILERS***""Loved it! Extremely emotional and breathtaking movie, with great action scenes, songs and dialogues. I absolutely loved the cinematography, visuals and the story-line. It is much more than just the revenge concept i originally thought it had and has a very significant message for viewers. Parts of it actually had me in tears and the plot twists were cool too. Not to mention the foreshadowing was done to the right amount and had everything fall into its place correctly, so that was really satisfying. However, the reason i didn't give it a full 10/10 is a very minor issue i had. I felt like into the first 30 minutes of the movie the love of the two main leads progressed really quickly, but i understand that they couldn't have dragged the love story for a long time which would make it boring. But other than that it was an epic movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have no idea really why the bashing of such an amazing title! and only the 8.0 score? really people? this movie has left me and my family with jaw open and tears in our eyes throughout the entire movie. People like frozen and they don't like Moana? really? whats wrong with people? It deserves every Oscar and every nomination there is.
*Awesome story *no annoying love story *Great singing even there was allot it was enjoyable *Great animation *Feel good factor after the movie *Watch it again? absolutely!
Please get your **** together guys. This is one of the best movies i have ever seen, the fact that Disney continues to impress me like this is just awesome, i thought i would never see more good movies from them.
Nothing less than a true masterpiece! Please make more good movies.""I am so glad to see Mel Gibson back to directing movies because ever since The Man Without a Face he has made many very good movies, among which my favourite has to be Braveheart, being an incredible film as well as Apocalypto, which is just as good. This time around, at the heart of this cinematic cyclone is a more conventional character study; of a man torn by his need to serve in a fight against Japan and a strict moral code that prevents him from taking life. Though, once on the battlefield the complexities of his moral fall away, replaced by the simple maths of saving lives.
Andrew Garfield, former Spidey, is so good at being an optimist in life, he has this infectious smile, he seems to be such a sweet guy and you really root for his character. Garfield is the warm anchor the film needs. Between this film and Silence, two contrasting tales of faith in an unforgiving world, any memories of the sad end to his web-slinging days should be well and truly banished. Teresa Palmer gives also the best performance of her entire career, as a nurse who Desmond meets, they get to know each other and their relationship is genuinely sweet and charming.
Vince Vaughn is in this movie and stole every scene he's in, as an aggressive motor mouth drill instructor. That casting choice is a reminder that Vince Vaughn is obviously very funny, but he also has some dramatic arcs. Moreover, Hugo Weaving gives one of the best performances in this film and I am so happy to see him again. I haven't seen him in a movie in a long time. He is always great, as his legendary roles can attest: Smith, Elrond, Red Skull or in V for Vendetta; this is what we love him for. In this film, he gives such a harden and emotionally powerful performance, as a man who has to deal with alcoholism. I am blown away by his work here.
The slow-burn promise of the film's opening acts pays off in a fierce focus on characters we have come to know, from all of the above to Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey. Biblical themes resonate and Doss's faith and certainties are tested in the movie's second act, a shift happens from home-baked heaven to the purgatory of military training. Mel Gibson and his scribes: Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan's grip on a familiar material is firm; their images, motifs and structures lend purpose to a potentially cheesy material.
The combat sequences, set on a blasted, blood-soaked Okinawan ridge in 1945, are filmed in Viscera Vision - they blaze and roar with the expression of pure violence. At some point, Mel Gibson leads us up a cliff and into a Bosch-ian nightmare. Between the mud, splayed bodies, bullet-pierced tin hats and torsos used as shields; the Battle of Okinawa pulverises. War has been hell in movies before, this is worse. What is impressive here, is how Gibson pushes his direction beyond the exploitative possibilities of raising hell.
The war scenes are brutally realistic and you can see that nothing has been held back and they are very well done and not romanticised at all. This happened. This sucked and this is the story of a man who tried to do something good. This is effectively shocking. Finally, you don't need to be a religious person to appreciate the movie. It addresses strong perspective for the character but you don't need to be religious to appreciate the spirit of this film, and the eternal truth that Human spirit is the most powerful thing you can have.
Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned story that Mel Gibson mainlines with bleeding-edge craft and technique - he has lost little of his knack for spectacle and has proved once again that he is a master behind the camera.""I've never seen the original TV series (I feel obliged to offer some preface in these matters) but damn, there's just something so refreshing about ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."". Not just as a genre movie, which sets itself apart from modern spy fare with a certain restraint towards its action scenes (even the torture is unconventional), but as a '60s throwback. It creates a stylized Cold War setting, and it's one I totally wouldn't mind returning to; I love that Morricone/Schifrin score.
The main cast (Cavill, Hammer and Vikander) shares a great chemistry and just seems to fit. This is another reason there should be a sequel. I mean, really, if there are two Sherlock Holmes movies, we deserve at least one more U.N.C.L.E.
Some of Guy Ritchie's movies I do love, and this is one of them.
8/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie really explains, what is wrong with our society and where the actual problem is. Whole story is elaborated so nicely, I very much felt frustration against people like those, that I see all the time. Putting restrictions on girls and judging them by their dress has always been common in our country.
I here Quote: a dialogue: ""Drinking is bad character for girls but only a health hazard for boys"".
Everyone did a really great job. Story is kept simple and close to real. The facts presented by movie are very straight forward and make you think, what fact or logic some perverts don't understand. Really provoking and is a must watch movie!!""I watched it last night and wasn't expecting much (because of all the negative reviews), however, I was pleasantly surprised. It actually has some very funny moments and the two leading ladies have a good on-screen chemistry. I really don't understand why people are coming out in droves to trash this film.... Reese and Sofia are both great and have solid acting chops.
There are a few predictable moments and it does start a little slow, but once it gets rolling it is overall pretty funny.
If you like comedies, and movies that aren't supposed to be taken seriously, then you won't be disappointed by Hot Pursuit. I enjoyed it so much that I plan on watching it again.""Finally, a true horror film. No starlets losing their tops running around aimlessly. This had a good plot, great film work, excellent suspense and a few well-deserved jump scares. Although some of the CG seemed low budget, I do believe it was certainly meant to come off that way based on the subject. Wilson and Farmiga create characters that are adaptable and believable. The supporting cast as well were very strong and created a true empathetic connection. It is a rare feat these days to create a creepy movie with strong character performances that do not not rely solely on CG or jump scares. If you are in the mood for a real horror movie, this just might fit your style perfectly. Very enjoyable.""About Time is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a very sweet and heartwarming film as we follow a young man who learns he has the power to time travel and uses it to win a girl over. However, as the film continues, he uses his power less and less, as he begins to savor the moments and not trying to reverse them. It easily could have been a typical love story, but it has plenty of elements that make it stand out.
The only real issue I had was Bill Nighy, I thought he was fantastic as the father and found him to be very underused. His character is underdeveloped, we learn very little about him, I would love to have gained more insight on him, as I thought the scenes between him and Gleeson's character are the film's highlights.
Domhnall Gleeson is stellar in this movie, believable and likable all the way through, as well as a character that I feel anyone can relate to. His chemistry with Rachel McAdams is phenomenal, it is a privilege to watch them on screen together, delivering pure, honest emotion.
The film leaves you feeling happy for the life you have lived and excited for what awaits, as we must make the best of the time we have. Sweet and well acted, I would recommend About Time to anyone looking for a good drama or romantic film.
A man's life gets complicated when he uses his ability to time travel to seek romantic bliss.
Best Performance: Domhnall Gleeson""While there are differences from Mary Shelley's earth-shattering novel, this version is quite true to the author's original. Not only that, the portrayal of the ""monster"" as a sophisticated man is much more true to the creature portrayed in the book. This personage, portrayed by Robert DeNiro, is fully aware of who he is and that he has been betrayed by Victor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) who throws him out like yesterday's garbage. The monster begins to resent the lives that others have and vows revenge on his creator. There are terrifying scenes of murder and mayhem. But the issue that is so poignant is whether such a creature has a soul; whether something composed of the parts of other humans can see eternity. This is one of the most philosophical portrayals of 19th century ethics I have seen. Excellent sets and mood inducing music.""Reviewed August 2011
Whoa!! Dudes!! The current number system may not be sufficient if you count how many times Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) utter this through the movie. My rating has nothing to do with the film making prowess or narration or acting. Just the entertainment value.
Bill and Ted are teenagers on the verge of failing their history class if they don't come up with a presentation. They are also budding musicians yet to learn how to play an instrument. They come across a Time Machine to gather 'Historical Figures' of the past for their presentation.
This was my first introduction to the concept of time travel and the fun that can be had fantasizing it. One of those movies that is so silly with really bad dialog and ridiculous acting, you'll start enjoying it. The concept of time travel is utilized to the full extent without a bother about neither the logic nor consequences which is good. Both leads play ball as morons with goofy mannerisms. A movie such as this has a thin line between working alright and being a disaster. This one just crosses the line.
Silly good fun.""I walked away from this movie with several emotions.
In regards to simply the movie, I thought it was excellent. The actions scenes were very well put together, nothing was over the top and it all was very believable. It reminded my very much of Black Hawk Down with a touch of Saving Private Ryan for reference. I read some about the actual events that this movie is based off of and from as best as I can tell it was very true to real events. The drama, the interaction between the soldiers and the CIA field workers, the scenery and city, everything was very well done.
What really blew me away and made this movie really hit me was this was real. These men really went through this. They really faced this adversity, this environment, these odds against him. These men are heroes. I am so humbled there are Americans like these men that protect us, yet go unnoticed and without thanks. We would not have the freedoms we have without men and women like these individuals. It also blew me away in seeing the depiction of the local civilians and how life was for them. The fact they were in a war zone and it was simply seen as ""normal"" to them.
For that reason, combined with how well this movie was done, this movie an absolute must see in my book. See this movie, I promise you will walk away thankful you did.""Japan, World War 2. Teenage boy Seita and his young sister Setsuko are left homeless and effectively orphaned when their city is firebombed by US bombers. They end up living with an aunt. Initially things go well and life seems almost normal again. However, their relationship with their aunt deteriorates and Seita and Setsuko decide to leave and fend for themselves. They find a place and things seem to be going well. However, over time food gets scarcer and life becomes a constant struggle for survival
A quite powerful examination of life among the civilian population of a nation at war. More broadly, this is a story of survival and the bonds between a brother and sister, made stronger by a cataclysmic series of events. The war is just the setting, and the initial cause of the events  at its core it's a human drama. This is good, as the movie could easily have gone down some sort of bleeding heart anti-war path or even a path that condemned the US bombing of Japanese cities in WW2 (which would have been absurd as the Japanese were just reaping the whirlwind after sowing the wind).
Incredibly engaging. You are emotionally invested in the lives of Seita and Setsuko, their struggles and wins, highs and lows. This makes the conclusion very emotional.
Superb animation, though you would expect nothing less from director Isao Takahata (director of the TV series Heidi and Maya, amongst others). Some of the imagery is stunningly beautiful, like watercolour paintings.
On the negative side, and probably the only reason I didn't give this a 10/10, the outcomes are a bit telegraphed. The conclusion would have been even more powerful and emotional if we didn't know in advance what it was going to be.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The plot and scenes in the movie kept you watching and wanting more every second. Never was there a dull moment or a time I found my mind wondering off. The story told and all the events do not seem to be stretched at all. There were a few things throughout the movie that were upscale a little bit for the ""Hollywood"" effect, but they didn't changed the story or ruin the movie at all.
The way the movie goes into such detail down to the sun bleached dirty clothing they are always wearing is perfect. The actors too. With some movies you get the minimum child actors who do just enough to get the part and fit in. The kids in this movie were perfect and didn't ruin the role.
Through out the movie, scene of a court case for the grandson of Newton Knight are shown. These scene I feel are unnecessary to the plot and story of the movie. They just tie in random bits and pieces.""I have to say that I enjoyed this film, but mostly for the subject matter, a court case that took place in 1998. We have for some time been made aware again of the Nazi's efforts to steal the great art of the world, particularly Western art. Movies like ""The Monument Men"" depict efforts to recover what they stole from the heart of the world. For this they can never be forgiven. The majority of these pieces have never been found. Fortunately, many of the works were kept in museums or in private residences and so were intact. This is the story of a piece that became known as the Austrian Mona Lisa. Helen Mirren is Maria Altman whose family owned the great portrait known as the Woman in Gold. When she finds some letters that tell of the story of the painting, she enlists a young Randy Schoenberg, the grandson of the great composer, to make a case for the return of the painting to its rightful heirs. Predictably, they wade through all the roadblocks, assisted by a young Austrian journalist. I have to agree with the reviews that talk about the good guys and the bad guys. I love Austria, especially Vienna, but here they are portrayed so harshly that we have little sympathy for their position. Ryan Reynolds is a little short on effort here, sort of phoning it in. But there are enough twists and turns and Mirren is great fun to watch to make it well worthwhile. I plan on seeing how realistic the portrayal was.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Gus Van Sant's Milk follows the story of out gay San Francisco City Council member Harvey Milk and his eventual assassination at the hands of fellow councilmember Dan White. Following the Oscar award winning screenplay writing by Dustin Lance Black, Milk successfully explores the later life of Harvey Milk as he battles against Proposition 6 in California, the fight for antidiscrimination protections for LGTBQ people, and creating a world in which gay people can be safely out anywhere. While it is by no means perfect, sometimes exaggerating the role Harvey played and underwhelmingly portraying the opposition, overall, Milk is a film that helps provide the education and exposure that display a pro-gay view of history and show activists like Harvey Milk in a way that benefits the gay rights movement and community.
Milk starts by opening with historical footage of police raids and then immediately lets the cat out of the bag by showing the announcement to the press that Dan White had shot and killed San Francisco mayor, George Moscone, and fellow councilmember Harvey Milk. By informing the audience of Harvey's inevitable demise early in the film, it turns the focus of the film away from Harvey's death at the hands of Dan White and instead sets the film up to push its narrative towards Harvey's contributions to the gay rights movement in the mid-1970s, forcing the film and the audience to see what the world lost when Harvey Milk was killed. After the historical footage, Milk turns to the last decade of Harvey Milk's life in the 1970s. On his 40th birthday, Harvey meets his first lover in the movie, Scott Smith, who eventually becomes the campaign manager for his run for San Francisco City Council. Moving to San Francisco, Harvey develops into an activist and decides to run for political office After unsuccessfully running for a seat in the city council twice, and due to redistricting, Harvey is able to win the seat for his district, the newly created District 5, representing the well-known gay Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. As a City Council member, he worked alongside Dan White and Harvey's liberal views clash with Dan's more conservative Catholic views. Harvey, after his relationship with Dan White sours because Harvey would not support one of Dan's bill, is able to propose and help pass an antidiscrimination ordinance for LGBTQ people in housing and employment in San Francisco. Next, Milk turns its attention towards California's Proposition 6, sponsored by California Senator, John Briggs, and elevated to national attention with the help of signer-turned-religious-activist Anita Bryant. Proposition 6 attempted to ban all homosexuals from teaching and possibly also remove anyone who supported LGBTQ people. All the while, Dan White, struggling with the financial instability of his failing business and low government salary and disheartened by the values of the political world of San Francisco, submits his resignation from the council. He later attempts to rescind his resignation, but Mayor Moscone refuses to reinstate him, after being petitioned by Harvey. This leads to the closing events of Milk, portraying Mayor Moscone and Harvey's murder by Dan and the candlelight vigil, attended by thousands, held for Harvey Milk.
Overall, I enjoyed Milk. I found Harvey's speeches inspiring and felt that I was watching Harvey resonate not only with the San Francisco gay community, but also LGBTQ people and straight people across America. Being gay myself, I wanted to learn more about LGBTQ history, but the traditional routes of schooling available to me were very lacking in LGTBQ education, let alone positive LGBTQ history. Milk treats me to the story of a politician who broke barriers and fought for the rights of people like me. Milk shows Harvey working through the religious and social discrimination that LGBTQ people experienced in the 1970s to promote important changes like San Francisco's gay rights ordinance and to prevent backwards legislation like Proposition 6, treating viewers to a positive take on Harvey's legacy and one of the few mainstream pro-gay films based on a true story.
However, Milk was not a perfect portrayal of Harvey Milk or the gay community at the time. Harvey's sexuality and the sexuality of gay life as a whole is portrayed in a diminished capacity, showing Harvey in particular as much more of a monogamous individual than history knows to be true. This may have been intentional, as Milk was released in 2008 only two months after California's Proposition 8 is passed, banning gay marriage again after it was made legal from a court ruling in May, 2008 and also in the midst of a Presidential election in which both candidates expressed opposition to gay marriage, although then presidential candidate Barack Obama supported civil unions at the time. Milk also gives Harvey almost all of the credit for the fight against Proposition 6, making the Castro, pre-Harvey, seem to have no other organizations successfully fighting for gay rights in San Francisco. In reality, Harvey had assistance from grassroots organizations that had formed nearly a decade before Harvey was elected as City Councilor.
Despite a couple criticisms, Milk and its portrayal of LGBTQ people and their concerns in the 1970s is accurate, positive, and is a great film. It provided the mainstream, straight audience a look into a community most history books dedicate little or no time to and lifts a gay rights hero to a worldwide stage where all can see the early fight for basic civil rights for LGBTQ individuals. I wholeheartedly recommend Milk.""Batman: The Killing Joke is an intense animated feature reminiscent of older times, when superheroes were only cartoons on screen. I enjoyed the animation of this film, and the plot was full of action and generally enjoyable to watch.
I found the film erred on the side of misogyny and over-sexualized Batgirl, but at the same time, if you look at the flip side of the coin, she is still a strong female character despite her hyper-sexuality. It is an unfortunate truth of most female comic strip characters, so we can just be thankful that she isn't a weak female protagonist. Although I didn't appreciate her being hysterical over her rocky relationship with Batman - that was an atypical response that was somewhat frustrating.
The Joker is excellent in this feature. He's absolutely insane all the way through to the end. We get a glimpse into his backstory, which makes you feel some empathy for him and his descent into madness. Once again, you see the parallels between the Joker and Batman - they are both isolated and violent characters on opposite sides of the same coin.
Besides some minor setbacks, I quite enjoyed this animated feature. Be forewarned: although it's a cartoon, it is quite violent and disturbing. View at your own discretion.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Glory was an excellent civil war movie that perfectly portrayed the journey of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and their leader Col. Robert Gould Shaw. It was more than just an ordinary war movie about gunfire and blood, it was a fight against racial prejudices and a fight to prove that blacks are just as capable to serve their country as whites are. The producers did a good job in minimizing the fighting and gore, as the movie was about more than just the war, it was about showing the glory and courage of 54th Massachusetts Regiment. The actors picked for the starring roles, Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes, and Morgan Freeman, all did an excellent job in playing their parts and working together. I especially liked the way Washington played his character as feisty and non-compliant while slowly changing throughout the movie and becoming a real leader by the end. There were many moments in the movie that showed the real courage and fight of the soldiers such as when no one backed down after learning about the Confederacy's Proclamation to kill anyone involved in a black infantry and the willingness of Shaw and his infantry to lead the battle at Fort Wagner, knowing they were certain for heavy casualties. It was quite tragic in the end to see that many of the soldiers and leaders had perished in the Battle of Fort Wagner especially since the Union forces didn't prevail there. But it was truly amazing to see how some of the white leaders such as Shaw had transformed and dropped their racial prejudices and literally gave their lives to a black regiment during these times, and the movie Glory portrayed that perfectly. It was also great when the producers added the writing at the end saying that even though the 54th regiment didn't win the battle it resulted in the authorization of many more black troops because of their courage in the battle and so Lincoln credited them with turning the tide of the war. There were a few historical inaccuracies that brought the movie down a tiny bit, such as the fact that the regiment was made up of mainly illiterate runaway slaves, when in reality they were actually educated free blacks. However, this was just to add to the effect and meaning and did not really harm the amazing movie.""It's hard to judge a movie when the topic of the movie is, in part, about artistic quality itself. Is the art displayed in this movie great art or not? In some ways, the commercialization and popularity of mass public dictation of art as presented in this movie can be distracting to the more intriguing and powerful issue of intimate relationships around which this movie is primarily centered. With grand strokes, Amy Adams takes on the relatively unknown backstory to a truly ""cute"" big eye artistic technique that is now seemingly found everywhere in every store in America. What she experiences in the 1950s and 1960s in terms of women's rights and dignity is as relevant as the civil right movement of the times. And with today's racial issues still simmering today, the concept of power and domination still resonant today.
The portrayal of Margaret Keane is an eye opening and told in magnificent brush strokes with close attention to a color palette. The director has managed to incorporate in lightness even within the emerging darkness of the storyline. Somehow the movie is sustained by the sad big eyes and the real-world response to the sparkling popularity of the emotion-laden products that seemingly permeate American society. There is initially hope then growing anger and frustration dripping from the storyline and yet based on a secure foundation that this is a movie about a hidden strength and personal integrity to be found and revealed to the world.
Big Eyes is actual simple in its true to life concept and yet told in a way that is emotional riveting, maintaining a strong sense of the story to be told.""I watched this a few nights ago and I just bawled my eyes out. yes, the story makes little logic, but I think that is the point. It isn't meant for critical eyed adults who scrutinize everything but for kids to enjoy. however, it is a light hearted and funny movie with hidden jokes for adults and I believe it is suitable for the whole family. I absolutely loved it. the ending had me in tears. there are some hidden meanings in the story, about acceptance, and what it means to be a family and cherishing those around you. it carries a great massage hidden within the comedy. someone in a vouge article said that the comedy fell flat, and to that I say f** off it is amazing.""I haven't seen so good movie as The Shining! I almost love every Stanley Kubrick's film but this is the best Stanley Kubrick's movie and my favorite movie ever. When I see Shelley Duvall nowadays, I feel bad for her. She made an excellent acting performance in this movie. Two Razzie nominees were really useless. But anyway, I love the movie so so much! You have to watch it, it's never too late to watch it. This movie is really one of those classic horror movies of all time. I have watched it already maybe 10 times or more... I am honest now and say: Stanley Kubrick still lives even he's already dead, in my heart <3 Thank you, Stanley Kubrick for great movie moments I have spent with you. You are my favorite movie director always! <3""So many people are complaining over this movie. You should all start to check the details of this beautiful movie. The intro is magnificent and the movie itself is on another level than many other movies made in the 21st century. I'm not here to tell you, you should rate this movie 10/10. However i do rate it 10 out of 10. Not because i'm an alien fan, but just because of the movie itself. It's not poorly made and the quality of the scenes are just way beyond many movies out there. The story is good and gets you slightly on the edge of your seat too. I don't want to give any spoilers, i just want people to watch the movie carefully and give an honest review about it. Just like i did now.
Hope you guys enjoy it and keep in mind this story will continue. They made it this way so you'll prepare for the next movie.
Regards""S. Craig Zahler's Bone Tomahawk is a generally obscure 2015 Western-Horror film. Yes, really. Western horror. It is truly a strange mix but Bone Tomahawk manages to be an excellent western film as well as excellent horror film, making this genre-jumper immensely entertaining and surprisingly smart. You would never expect anything like Bone Tomahawk to get made, but after viewing, you will want more.
Bone Tomahawk features a talented, but somewhat B-list, cast with Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson being the film's most recognizable frontrunners. Every actor involved here, however obscure, does a fantastic job. There was a constant sense of realism and honesty in every performance, making the entire film all the more involving. The main 4 characters that we follow throughout have great chemistry and share some interesting dialogue. While all playing cowboys, they each manage to generate their own distinct personalities and traits creating a strange, yet entertaining, chemistry between them all.
Bone Tomahawk is a film that is almost guaranteed to stick with you for a while after viewing. Whether this is due to the horrific violence or it's quick changeup of genre, it is certainly an impressively audacious debut film from director Zahler. But it succeeds in it's goal of creating a unique mix of genres so well that the idea never comes off as irresponsible, but rather genuinely impressive. The film's subject matter was handled so well that even it's most bombastic ideas and aspects felt surprisingly mature. Our director seems to indulge in the extremely graphic and disturbing violence but never to the point where it feels unnecessary. It's surprisingly well handled and smart with it's subject matter when it could've easily been silly and juvenile.
It's not quite enough to say that Bone Tomahawk is just underrated as the high quality and smart narrative make it a truly great film as well as under appreciated. The visceral scenes of action and violence adds to the unwavering sense of tension and unpredictability as we progress through the brilliantly unique and twisted story. Expertly crafted, relentlessly intense and full of character, Bone Tomahawk is a truly impressive debut feature from director Craig Zahler, whom I have high expectations for in the future as his obvious confidence behind the camera is much needed trait that many modern filmmakers lack.""Watching this once more, this time on blu-ray, I am reminded just how very good a film it is. McCabe and Mrs Miller has always been my favourite Altman film but I think this might just be a little better and a little more enjoyable. Ironic, of course, to watch this on the sharper medium when so much effort went into 'flashing' the film stock so as to partially degrade it and take that ultra bright look out. Altman himself wonders whether he went too far and there are one or two spots where there might be concern particularly in the darker corners but overall he has effectively altered the look so as to make the film more timeless. Sure there are the naked yoga ladies across the way to constantly remind one this is a seventies film but Gould (in a sensationally laid back performance) seems to wander in and out of this time and place quite effortlessly. Enthralling and believable with great dialogue, this is a joy to watch.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Co-written by Joss Whedon, this Don Bluth movie feels similar to Disney movies like Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Treasure Planet. It's an action adventure with ancient treasure, spaceships, betrayals, a large cast of characters and a mix of traditional animation and CGI.
I'm proud to say that I recently watched every Don Bluth movie, a feat that wouldn't faze a child but wasn't always easy for a 28-year-old who didn't have a nostalgic attachment to most of these movies. Gems like The Secret of NIMH or Anastasia were surrounded by the chaff that is The Pebble and the Penguin or Bartok the Magnificent. I was delighted that the project ended on a high note, Bluth's last film Titan A.E.
Titan A.E. was an edgy adventure with nudity, blood, seedy motivations and rock music soundtrack, clearly marketed to be a step away from the Disney children's movies and more for teenage boys who adored Star Wars more than anything. The space opera influence is obvious in everything: the lasers, the planets, the aliens. But this movie sidesteps the meaningless technobabble and focuses on the fun and the imagination.""Audition (1999) is a very good neo-noir directed by Takashi Miike. The screenplay explores many themes of human behavior, like loneliness, adult abuse of children, obsession, blindness of love, deception of surface appearance, impulsiveness, violence, and male abuse of females.
Although war and human brutality do not ever come into the story, the torture that is shown and the gratification from extremely brutal treatment of one human being by another implicitly condemn human beings in their wholesale slaughters and maiming. The victims and the nature of their injuries and mutilation suggest implicitly that they have emerged from war zones that had the most barbarous effects.
The story-telling and presentation are wisely cut back and simplified to essentials, making the story suspenseful. At the 85-minute mark comes a bold non-linear experiment in telling the story. We see quite a lot of new parts of the story that time-wise occurred earlier but were not shown at those movie times.
This is not a picture for children, the impressionable or the squeamish.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Tim Burton's latest opus sees his favourite actor, Johnny Depp, essaying the role of the killer barber that Tod Slaughter made (in)famous back in the 1930s. Rather than being a straightforward adaptation of the penny-dreadful horror yarn, this is instead the film version of the Sondheim musical that enjoyed immense popularity back in the 1970s. With me so far? I was a little disappointed when I saw that Depp was, yet again, starring in the title role  can't Burton find another actor? The good news is that this is one of Depp's best turns, second only to his Ed Wood. He makes the role his own and, while he lacks the lip-smacking relish that Slaughter brought to the character, he nevertheless sets the stage alight.
The film isn't perfect by any means. Then again, musical adaptations rarely are. I could do without the CGI depictions of the London environs, which are sometimes zoomed through as if the camera's on a motorbike. And did we really need yet another SCUMMY turn from Timothy Spall, who takes typecasting to a whole new level? Burton seems a little unsure of himself at first, what with the new genre and all, but he handles this well and the various musical numbers are all well-staged and well-sung.
More bonuses come from supporting cast members  a restrained Alan Rickman, a Gothic Helena Bonham Carter  and the fact that Burton brings the story slap-bang into the 21st with buckets of delicious gore. Yes, the unrestrained throat cuttings are surprisingly played for laughs, taking the proceedings to a Grand Guignol level. Especially good is the blood-soaked climax, which is almost Shakespearian in nature. Okay, so the sub-plot about star-crossed lovers is so familiar as to be utterly mundane and uninteresting, but for the most part, SWEENEY TODD is a step in the right direction: good, stylish, and proud.""The word beautiful comes to mind when I think of ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", not just in the animation but also the story. Laika Entertainment has that art style that took me a little bit to get used to (the characters have a wood-carved look that I'm never really grabbed me) and I think that's worth mentioning because there's plenty here to help overcome that. Just the imagery of an origami Samurai shows off the incredible action staging and sense of movement (seriously, you don't expect to be so charmed by a paper swordsman, but that happens here).
But it's also a tale steeped in Japanese folklore and full of family secrets and narrative twists. This plays on pretty much every emotion; and it's easy to write that off as callous manipulation, but there is some serious heart to this movie.
8/10""Nothing to say except that this is yet another WWII film which deserved a full cinema release but seems to have gone 'straight to video' on Sky. A story, set in Czechoslovakia, I had never heard before about the attempted assassination of the architect of The Final Solution. Brilliantly produced, directed, and acted. A tragic and 'must see' movie. Please see it as it is important that these stories are passed on. Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dorian are excellent, as are the supporting cast members. The pacing is tense and the movie flies by. I don't understand why I had not heard of this movie before as it only came out in 2016. It deserves to reach a wider audience.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a very very useful to plan your carrier. and Aamir Khan (actre) significant role in this Movie as a Best Student, Best Friend, Best Lover, Loyal & Honestly i love this Movie till last Day of My life.

It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama ""Hidden Figures"" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority  and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home)  in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie  and might be too much for many  but ""Hidden Figures"" is up to the challenge.
The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers  THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room  and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA  talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.
Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture  and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.
All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay  and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.
But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled ""Colored"" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers  and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart  and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.
""Hidden Figures"" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women  until now. Don't let ""Hidden Figures"" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's out of this world. ""A+""""Andrei Tarkovsky is widely understood to be one of the most important directors in the history of cinema. His works often focus on metaphysical and philosophical topics. ""Stalker"" is an example. At first the movie reminded me of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist play ""No Exit"" (about a bunch of people trapped in an existential hell), as the Stalker, Writer and Professor had trouble escaping the blockaded region of the Zone. As the protagonists headed for the heart of the Zone, the movie began to remind me of Jim Jarmusch's ""Down by Law"", about three men who escape jail and wander through rural Louisiana. Once the protagonists reach the Room, the movie really takes off.
It's worth noting that this is not a movie for those who are used to action flicks. It contains long shots and goes long periods without dialogue. If you're going to watch this movie, you'd better have a long attention span. This holds true for the other Tarkovsky movies that I've seen. That's better, in my opinion. The last thing that we need is another movie contributing to ADHD.
If I were going to postulate the gist of the movie, I would say that we have to seek our own answers for the meanings of our lives. These men go on an expedition hoping to have their innermost desires fulfilled, only to find that the place has trash everywhere. Maybe our innermost desires have to come from us directly, as opposed to some esoteric entity.
Maybe that's just me. Whatever the gist is, ""Stalker"" is a great movie. One of the all-time high points of cinema, like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". Definitely see it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Oliver Stone brought his first-hand experience as a Vietnam veteran behind the camera in what is arguably his magnum opus. Crafting a gripping and haunting film that brought out the nightmares of the horrors of war, Stone rightfully won his first Oscar for Best Director as well as Best Picture.
Telling the tale of a ragtag platoon of soldiers from the perspective of newbie infantryman Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) about the atrocities of the war and how it affects each of the core players; the film's major players are all based upon people known by Oliver Stone during his service.
The pivotal role of Chris Taylor was based on the director himself; a college drop-out eager to serve his country, but soon realizing how horrifying war really is and thus must become a stronger man and no longer a frightened boy among men. Charlie Sheen is perfectly cast as Taylor and is able to be sympathetic despite his naivety. The character of Chris Taylor is silent for the majority of the film except for his voice-overs and rare exchanges with his comrades. Sheen boldly develops his character deftly from the fresh-faced novice frightened by what he sees, moments perfectly captured in the night watch scene and the village raid, to a hardened young man who is no longer afraid to act in a brutal fashion as evidenced in Taylor's final encounter with Tom Berenger's brutal Sergeant Barnes at the end of the film.
Providing the film's greatest internal conflict is the constant power struggle within the unit between Tom Berenger's arrogant and brutal Barnes (Berenger scored a nomination for Best Actor) and Willem Dafoe's peaceful, tactful Sergeant Elias (Dafoe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor). The differences between the men show the display of how war affects the once able-bodied souls who go to serve; Barnes representing a hardened, violent and quick-to-act soldier unafraid to turn on his own, particularly in the horrible moment where he ambushes Elias, while Elias represents the passive face of what is to come with war, but this does not mean the sergeant won't strive to serve and protect his unit.
Caught in the middle of the sergeants' warring spar is Sheen's Taylor. As Taylor states at the film's end, ""Still fighting for what Roc called 'the possession of my soul'"", this thought echoes Chris's own turmoil for how he must choose to act: forceful and cruel like Barnes or with discipline and heart like Elias. As the film's events steer to the dark actions the group takes, the rage boils deeper within Barnes and Elias until it reaches a fever pitch and the two men fist-fight which eventually leads to Elias's iconic death scene. The outcome can only turn out one way by the time Elias is heartbreakingly slain before the platoon's and viewer's eyes: someone must pay.
This isn't the easiest film to watch, but the topic of the war in Vietnam is important and not forgotten. Keep tissues nearby and prepare to be enraptured with this magnetic gem.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The quality of animation and sound design in Your Name rival the likes of Akira and Studio Ghibli as does the level of creativity in its cinematography. These are what allow the film to generate laughter and then tears in succession with no diminishing returns. Likewise, Your Name is one of those movies whose plot repeatedly defies expectations and whose premise the audience will not likely pin down until the credits are rolling.
Written with love and captivatingly delivered, Makoto Shinkai has written a story that would be done a disservice were it described only as a Slice of Life; a genre that Japanese animated and live cinema have already redefined. It is a love story, an Epic, a coming of age story and a comedy. Above all Your Name is quintessentially Japanese. Shinkai effortlessly synthesises life in rural, traditional Japan with the Westernised cityscape of Tokyo, draws on shared tragedy and explores the dual natures of progress and the loss of one's history. Your Name also bridges the gap between mythology and science-fiction. The effect of this blend is not to contrive the plot or overshadow the characters but rather serve to help realise both.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One day two alien babies were sent to Earth; one landed in a wealthy household, developed superpowers and grew up to be the superhero Metro Man; the other landed in prison, developed a powerful mind and grew up to become the supervillain Megamind this film follows the latter. The two are rivals; Megamind plots his schemes against Metro City and Metro Man thwarts them and sends him to prison. Then one day Megamind kidnaps reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who everybody believes is Metro Man's girlfriend, and waits for him to try to rescue her. He manages to captures Metro Man and fires his death ray at him knowing he will escape only he doesn't. While using a disguise he rescues Roxanne and the two grow close; until she realises who he is. He soon realises that without a hero to fight against his life has no meaning. To solve this problem he sets about creating another hero with Metro Man's powers; unfortunately the wrong man gets the powers and Metro City ends up with a much more unpleasant villain: Titan. With a new villain in town Megamind will have to change; he will have to become a hero then maybe he will win and even get the girl.
This movie turned out to be a lot of fun; there are so many films centred on the superhero so it made a refreshing change have one that followed the villain. The early scenes played with the genre clichés in an enjoyable way that led up to the genuinely surprising 'death' of Metro Man. It later emerges that he isn't dead but not for quite a while. The main characters were fun; Megamind is suitably dastardly without actually being malicious; Metro Man is sickeningly perfect and Roxanne is feisty and avoids many of the character traits we would expect; notably her not being romantically interested in Metro Man. Titan is a decent enough bad guy; he is clearly not very bright and emotionally backward. The character designs are good, the animation is of a high standard and the voice cast do a fine job of bringing them to life. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for an animation that can be enjoyed by all ages.""Face/Off is a film with such a bizarre story that you might think you won't enjoy it. However, once you get past the very far-fetched plot, you'll find a really good film lurking in the background. It does have a complex story, but is told in a straightforward manner that makes it easy to follow.
While the film contains some very good action scenes, and an equally good amount of drama, the most entertaining aspect is watching John Travolta and Nicolas Cage play each other; the performances from the two are excellent, you genuinely believe they are in each other's skin.
A must watch for anyone who likes action films that try something a little bit different.""Generally, when we speak of ""Fight Club"" or you tend to underestimate or overestimate, some say that it is a masterpiece, and some say that is mediocre. I think it is a masterpiece (While not the best Fincher), because it can send a deep message through the use of images and strong words that can penetrate deeply. ""Fight Club"" is not a film for rebellious teenagers, this film is a lot more and to understand better you need to have much culture and a basic understanding of philosophy. Especially the thought of Hobbes and Marx, since the main issues are critical to the consumer society and man's ability to be mean and ruthless towards his similar (Homo homini lupus).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A deadly virus released in 1996 wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing remaining survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be behind the release of the virus. In 2035, James Cole (Willis) is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected for a mission, where he is trained and sent back in time to locate the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure.[3] Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and an airport shooting.
Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe). There he encounters Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), a mental patient with fanatical views. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back in his own time. Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he is suddenly transported to 1996.""An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after ""The Rite of Spring"" because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism.""Something about Kingpin just warms your heart. The characters are all very likable, Woody Harrelson is a relatable man going through hard times in his seemingly washed away existence, Bill Murray is absolutely hilarious as a slime ball villain, and Claudia is gorgeous and is very effective at stealing your attention.
The beauty of this film lies in the re-viewings, the subtle things through out that add lots of humour and further develop the characters. I forgot to mention Randy Quaid, he is also brilliant in this film, the delivery of his lines are to a tee.
So if you are someone who like me has a dirty mind and a cruel sense of humor, you will love Kingpin.""I so loved this movie and it will forever go on!
I really hope that they would renew it, it would be so awesome! I know a lot of kids these days don't know about the Elephant man and need to know. He needs to regain his popularity back! I'm just saying it would be so so awesome! Perhaps they could do with a little vengeance, action, and sincerity in the new film. I'm just wondering who would play him and who could maybe produce this in the future. I know anyone who loves the Elephant Man would insist on this. It just needs to be brought back, some good old time movie but with a new presence of today's society and what other people go through now. There have been lots of body shaming and bullying, you name it. Just something to think about. I think this movie would just make a great impression on those.""I have literally watched this movie 9 times. beginning till the end. it never gets boring. i don't know what it is about it. the village, the scenery, how its filmed, the story, plot, acting of course.. but if you haven't seen this one yet.. what are you doing??? stop everything and watch this movie. it was after this movie I became an absolute fan of Simon Pegg. Put him in any role and makes it look so easy. the overall concept of this movie itself is very catchy and keeps you hooked till the very end. Direction is marvelous. I am sure there are critics out there who can pin point the flaws in this movie as well, I for one am not a professional critic. I just love to watch movie and this is one of my ever green favorites.""I was NOT ever a Kennedy supporter. Not back then. Now, 50 years + later, how I wish these men had been given the opportunity to carry out their terms and change America to include all our people and begin to really build America. I would vote for them today! What their father did to build the family fortune was back in the 30's! Who cares! I think his sons wanted to give back to America. (not so abiding with Teddy. His lack of judgment at Chappaq was unforgivable)I just think it is UNthinkable that JFK MX MLK & RFK were ALL assassinated back in the 60's. That is about as ugly a chapter that America has ever shown to the world, outside of the Civil War! It is so perplexing to comprehend this happening in America.""This is just a load of animated fun. Our dearest possessions, our cars, are made anthropomorphic, and take on the personalities of their functions. The old tow truck, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, is my favorite character, and he functions as the voice of the drawling hick. The sports car is reckless and unpredictable. Of course, vehicles of law enforcement have their own way of acting as well. So the creators have put together an entire subculture where these vehicles are the stars. It sounds silly until we begin to be engaged in their roles. There are protagonists, antagonists, characters of comic relief, just like any movie, animated or not. Pixar has masterfully connected what would have been flat animated images and brought them to life. I'm not much of a car fancier, but this one still got me. There's adventure, romance, and a race. What else could we want?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If there was only the scene of Baby Jane singing and dancing to her child song as she did in her youth, Ms. Davis would have been nominated for the Oscar for it. Maudlin, grotesque, creepy, campy-- need I say more? I have never seen such a bizarre display of weirdness from an actress, and no one will ever equal it. I think the directing here was exquisite. He let Ms. Davis sing and dance the entire song, just as she did in the opening number-- instead of just a snippet as some directors might. This way you get to watch for a long time the delusion of Baby Jane and see Bette Davis milk the scene to perfection. A great cult classic! 10 out of 10.""Everything in this movie is just perfect. Starting for the idea that unlike most of the musicals are based on the fact that almost all the movie is singed with no purpose, this film have the particularity that the characters only sing when they are feeling so great emotions that cant be expressed with only talking, so they start to sing and dance. As i said, and as you could see, they are not the best voices in this movie because the movie doesn't focus really on that (as most of the musicals) this movie shows a very human story which the one you can fill identified. Art, music, image and the complement of all this elements is just out of this world""Soylent Green is an excellent dystopian science fiction classic starring Charlton Heston. Along with Planet Of The Apes and The Omega Man, Soylent Green is in the same vein and is very entertaining, cerebral and well made all around. This very bleak, but socially relevant and thought provoking film is a cautionary tale that is grounded in scientific fact and where we could be headed if we don't make drastic changes. The year is 2022 and is set in NYC, where it is overcrowded, polluted and resources such as food and water are scarce. Charlton Heston is a police detective that is investigating a murder, which leads him to uncover some disturbing facts that are trying to be buried by The Soylent Corporation, who is a primary food source and distributor to the majority of the population worldwide. Leigh Taylor Young is ""furniture"", owned by the building and her job is to please her wealthy male tenants, while getting to live a life far more comfortable than most people could dream of as her reward for her services. Her husband/tenant was murdered and ends up being love interest for our leading man Heston. Heston, was a lucky man and Leigh Taylor Young was gorgeous. This was the final film for screen legend Edward G Robinson and had a great rapport and chemistry with Heston. The film is gritty and grimy and paints a nightmare picture of the future. Richard Fleisher did his best work with this film and is a great sci fi thriller with lots of social commentary and suspense. Soylent Green is an absolute classic and is every bit as good and as important as the original Planet Of The Apes.""From beginning to end, 'La La Land' is in many ways an exercise in bravura film-making, one that blends technical skill with incredibly poignant storytelling masterfully. Chazelle's vision is incredibly clear, matched only by his terrific direction, capturing the spirit of classic Hollywood musicals whilst elevating the genre to a whole new level through its devastatingly beautiful visuals. Be it through exuberant musical numbers or sun-drenched montage sequences, 'La La Land' is sure to leave audiences cheering and begging for an encore.
From the cinematography to the set designs to the costumes and makeup, the film crafts an aesthetic that becomes key to the world it creates and the characters that inhabit it. Sebastian, an unashamed Jazz pianist with wholehearted ambitions of owning his own club, and Mia, an aspiring actress with heart, soul and talent, hanging onto her waitressing job whilst rushing back and forth between auditions. Throughout the film, we see both give up on their dreams, sell out or lose faith in what they're trying to achieve. Mia and Sebastian are an unlikely couple, yet they are bound together by each other's sheer determination.
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both have undeniable chemistry, anchoring down the film with tremendous performances. Stone in particular was born to play Mia, a character who in many ways represents the theme 'La La Land' urges us to explore, hopes and aspirations being discarded in favour of what stands in-between. The pair are desperately in love, yet they each stand in the way of the other.
'La La Land' is a homage to classic romance in cinema, dating back to an age when true happiness was associated with sunset endings, a kiss and a fade to black. Spinning feverishly whilst infusing passion and charisma with intense emotion, the film ends with an alternate version of the events that occurred being played back to us, and we see Mia smile across at Sebastian.
An ending that may not be perfect to some, yet, if 'La La Land' teaches us anything, it's that it doesn't need to be.""This was another great film from Danny Boyle! This is a heist movie, in a non-traditional way. There is a heist, but most of the movie revolves around trying to find out what happened to the painting after the heist. McAvoy, Cassel, and Dawson were all excellent in this. It is an exciting psychological thriller, with visually interesting film making throughout.
I enjoyed the many twists and turns throughout this movie. I enjoyed McAvoy's performance in this quite a bit. I haven't seen anything he has been in since Wanted, so I forgot how good he was. He plays a man who works at a high end auction gallery.
This is not a straight-forward heist movie, and that makes it that much more entertaining. It is a bit artsy with Danny Boyle's touch, but it is well done. There is some good action sequences, and the way it is shot makes you think about things a bit. I like how it is a bit confusing, then it becomes clearer and clearer as the movie goes on. It is has an excellent ending that was thrilling. Check it out if you are a fan of smart thrillers, or Danny Boyle. 8/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Going into the film I had no idea what to expect except for a Big Friendly Giant. This film completely felt like Spielberg and it was a heart warming film with a little of an unbelievable ending. Sophie played by Ruby Barnhill is a great young actress and her relationship with the BFG played by Mark Rylance made the whole film. At first, the BFG kidnaps Sophie to protect his existence from being revealed but later on Sophie sees good in the Giant and learns that he is the runt of the group of giants. The film deals with dreams the good ones and the bad ones and all in between have a different color. It reminds me of Inside Out. The BFG collects dreams and has the ability to create dreams. Sophie being a tiny human teaches the giant to stand up for himself and to trust more. which leads us to the ending. Sophie and the BFG team up and get help from the Queen and together they get rid of the mean giants. Overall, the film touched upon many human themes and is a well made beautiful film. If you haven't seen it I encourage you to do so. 8.4/10.""*** This review may contain spoilers ***
Directed By: Chris Columbus
Starring: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.
Overview: A great start to a franchise. Definitely worth a watch.
Good:
1. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are great, especially for such a young age.
2. Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman are, of course, great as Hagrid, Dumbledore and Snape respectively.
3. All characters are great.
4.The cinematography was great and had some pretty fine shots.
5. The music is brilliant.
6. The entire universe is so great and brilliantly done.
7. The lighter tone until the later conflict is great.
Bad:
1. Professor Quirell is an uninteresting villain and him as an introduction to Voldermort was stupid.
2. It has to spend a lot of time setting up the universe which is understandable but annoying nonetheless.
3. The way some plot points are revealed is stupid.
--""This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play: Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this film is the charactersevery day people like ourselvesseeing themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is respected beautifullybut hats off to the directors for expanding it into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You will benefit from seeing this film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is definitely a sit-back-and-enjoy kind of movie  sadly a rare animal now-a-days. I have always liked Michael J. Fox, and he did a real bang up job in this film. How can you not like Marty McFly? It does tear my heart out that he suffering the way is. I am always impressed with the talent of Crispin Glover. As versatile as this person is, I see him and all I can think of is his performance in 'River's Edge'  b  more of them willys running up and down my spine. I guess the actor who grabbed me most (and probably most movie-goers), has to be Christopher Lloyd. I mean, who doesn't want DeLorean with the all-powerful Flux Capacitor. The pace of this movie is fast and the writing has a solid plot. Overall, I would say this was one of my favorites. Granted, I latched on to other productions as 'favorite' but this is still a very watchable and enjoyable 80's romp. I do miss movies made for the customer or audience and not for some performers' political projects. If you haven't seen, you may enjoy it. Try itI liked it.""So Morgan directed by Luke Scott is a sci-fi horror movie with the plot involving a team of scientist tried to raise a girl made from a lab that go horribly wrong .Basic concept that has been made million time before but this time it actually tried to tell a different story.Much like his dad Sir Riddley Scott the man who brought us many great sci-fi movie like Blade Runner,Alien and Prometheus he really know how to shoot a movie with great cinematography and beautiful isolation location.The acting in this movie is great,everybody is giving their best work throughout the movie with two spot on performance by Kate Mara and Anya Taylor-Joy play the main character Morgan who keep proving herself is one of the best young actress working day.In the end this is a damn fine sci-fi horror movie with many intense scene,good action movie set pieces and a very shocking third part which make me feel very disturbed.If you a hardcore sci-fi movie fan definitely check this movie out""One wonders how the FBI and associated health professionals could have had the recent mentally unbalanced Fort Lauderdale shooter within their firm grasp in Alaska and then released him with his weaponry. The Alaska law does not allow holding a suspect who has voluntarily committed himself. That's one factor, but the larger background is the failure of these public bureaucracies within the justice system to operate on a common sense basis, due to their lack of proper incentives. This digression into current events is pertinent because this is what Zodiac (2007) is largely about: The failure of police and justice institutions to apprehend a killer in a timely and effective manner. Over and over and over again, the story and screenplay show us police departments operating at cross-purposes, bedeviled by too much noise from the public, failures to connect the dots, loss of evidence, sheer ineptitude, etc. One might think that a single national agency like the FBI would better coordinate the police work, but as 9/11 shows tragically, this is not the case.
Director David Fincher did a great job with this neo-noir, working with excellent underlying written materials via the book on this killer by Robert Graysmith, played in the movie by Jake Gyllenhaal. The production design (really production, art and sets) and cinematography boost this movie immensely. It has a consistent look to it that befits the subject matter. The viewer accepts the authenticity of the period due to this successful effort. The actors were directed to be more or less average people, without fantasy entering in, and this also contributes to the feeling of reality. Yet there is enough drama and natural conflict to it all to hold us. This is really a very skilfully done picture.""Directed by Nitesh Tiwari who has directed hit films like ""Bhootnath Returns"" and ""Chillar Party"" is now trying his direction skills with a biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat who is a former wrestling champion from Haryana. The best part about this flick is the one and only Aamir Khan himself who is known as a perfectionist of Bollywood when it comes to giving best films to the box office. After two years of super blockbuster film ""PK"" 2014 where Aamir unleashed all the limits of his perfectionism, he is back with a bang again along with his 2016's super powerful flick ""Dangal"" which is a story about a former wrestler champion Mahavir Singh Phogat and his efforts for training his own daughters Geeta and Babita who are India's most well known and celebrated female wrestlers who have also garnered medals in Commonwealth Games. The flick is starring Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra. The film has already hit the theater's on December 23, 2016. And if you haven't planned to watch this film I have brought you 5 solid reasons to book tickets and watch ""Dangal"".
1. Aamir's honest dedication
Mr. Perfectionist (Aamir Khan) is a keen actor when it comes to exhibit the authenticity of his character in any of his film. In this film Dangal, Aamir has to exhibit one character in two different physiques according to the demand of script in which he plays both young and old Mahavir Singh's character which again has a twist. The young Mahavir Singh in an athletic, muscular and broad shouldered physique whereas the old Mahavir Singh who trains his own daughters for wrestling is a fat, chubby, over weight and pot bellied personality of 97 kg. To play such an overweight personality, Aamir ate whatever he wanted and put on weight to reach 97 kg almost 100 kg and then he prepared himself to lose weight to get back to a fit and muscular physique with six packs to play the young Mahavir wrestler's role. This is what we call honest dedication by an honest actor. Amir Khan fans always wait eagerly for his master flicks because this perfect actor always come up with an excellent and exceptional script to keep his fans and viewers engaged. ""Dangal"" the biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat wrestler is not only about his athletic career but also about his inspirational journey as a father and a trainer of his own daughters who are India's well known female wrestlers.""The World War 2 history of General George S Patton, US Army. We see his contribution to the Allied War effort, from North Africa, to Sicily to Europe, especially the Battle of the Bulge. We also see his forthright views on war and winning it, his tactical and strategic military genius, his aggressive manner of waging war as well as his blunt, mischievous, rebellious, almost insubordinate attitude.
Superb film on an extraordinary, larger-than-life man. Patton was truly a military genius and the movie demonstrates this very well. It also demonstrates well the lack of diplomacy which often set his career back.
Excellent performance by George C Scott in the lead role, a performance for which he won an Oscar.
The movie itself won the 1971 Best Picture Oscar.""Paul Dano has done it again. He picks the most offbeat roles and plays them to perfection. This is particularly offbeat. And Daniel Radcliffe is outstanding as a guy who may be dead or may be very inadvertently resourceful with his body. Now there's a sentence you'd never thought you'd read. This movie has everything: action, comedy, drama, romance, suspense, and for good measure a hearty dose of flatulence. But don't let the last part put you off. This movie has a lot of heart. It's a clever idea. And the filmmakers should be commended for definitely thinking outside the box. It does start like a cross between Cast Away and Weekend at Bernies, but it grows into something so much better than either. This is my enthusiastic recommendation. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but mostly because you laughed so hard you cried.""Saving Private Ryan, The ground beneath you begins to rattle as flashes of gunfire illuminate the sky. Fighter planes flying over , Men in their moss green helmets,dripping in the cold crisp ocean water in the boats below...It's Dooms Day. Saving Private Ryan follows the indescribable bond,brotherhood and sacrifice in the time of war. Saving Private Ryan an example of the selfless commitment and dedication in protecting a life other than your own. A movie filled with heart, honor and sacrifice, Saving private Ryan keeps its audience engaged through the trials and tribulations of the men, women and families of our armed forces in a war that changed the lives of Americans forever.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** *I Will try not to use spoilers but will notify prior if I deem necessary for the review
Overall: I challenge anyone to legitimately complain about this movies magic. It is a masterpiece and quite frankly one of the greatest movies ever made and easily the greatest serial killer movie ever made.
Good: Incredible and jaw dropping cinematography and sound design with each shot drumming up suspense and tension for the climax. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and the mad genius who portrayed the serial killer(I won't spoil if you have, for some reason, not witnessed this masterpiece). The characters were so rich with detail and purpose that I cared about them from the offset and throughout. An absolutely genius story with a genius ending that should go down with the greats in cinema history. The villain is just plain genius and naming him John Doe just adds so much mystery and intrigue behind him that presents him as a faceless character with I think is perfect. Whoever conceived the idea of the seven deadly sins should be awarded an Oscar... then locked away for the rest of their lives in an asylum for coming up with the sick events in this movie. Then again if they weren't clearly sick, we wouldn't have this masterpiece here now, would we? The gritty and dark tone is just wondrous and the presentation of the city and gritty and grim just makes it too a faceless representation so it could be anywhere. I have watched this movie multiple times and I still feel shocked and my skin goes cold when that ending arrives. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. Well done Fincher!
*My Flaw is a spoiler to some extent so I wouldn't read this if you haven't watched the movie.
Bad: I have one flaw with this movie and that is the bit after the ending. Once Brad Pitt kills Kevin Spacey enacting Wrath, I feel it should have just cut to black and I feel the Quote: at the end from Morgan Freeman was misplaced and shouldn't have been in the movie. It should have cut to black.
*SPOILERS
Best Part: 'WHAT'S IN THE BOX '
MVP: Kevin Spacey as John Doe
10/10""One of the most amazing movies I've seen lately, although I do believe you need to have a taste for this (sub)genre - if you like psychologically thrilling stories (such as Exam, for example), this movie will be very enjoyable to you, just as it was to me.
I would say it explores the relations between various (stereo)types of people in a situation in which they have to choose which one will have to die next. It also explores which one will emerge as ""the alpha"" (or simply, the winner) each time a person needs to be killed.
What I particularly liked is that this is a very simple movie - the production is simple, and the story setup as well - but it still manages to keep you on the edge.
Kept me on the edge until the last moment.""A humorous sci-fi movie! Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox excelled at there roles. They worked together so well that I couldn't imagine any other two people for there characters. The director did a fabulous job, he picked a wonderful cast and of course can't forget the crew that does most of the dirty work. Wouldn't it be so amazing to travel back in time. Marty (Michael J Fox) learns this lesson all to well as he finds himself needing to fix a few things in his past. Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) really adds the humor to this movie, his character is a bit weird I should say but hands down one heck of a funny guy. This movie never gets old, I have watched it over 20 times and still can't get enough of it. Enjoy this movie, it's one of a kind for sure.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Amelie is not just a naive girl and she definitely is not innocent. When she enters her neighbor apartment she shows that her actions are not just a child play, they are calculated and above all filled with great sense of justice. With her isolated way of life she developed special skill of noticing little beauties in everyday life. Curiosity and imagination are something we try to use to fight boring reality, but somehow her reality is not boring at all. This is a movie that shows us magical specialty of every person's life, all stories are worth telling, or at least enjoying in. Looking forward to discover more movies like this one; I think it's a perfect one.""The world was magical, so I put up with intermittent excessive song and dance. An ever-present current of warm piano gave the film a sense of unity that felt reminiscent of Chazelle's prior film, Whiplash. I did not care much for the bland characters and their cliché plights, but Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were not the central characters of this film...the sets, the music, and Los Angeles were the focus. Over time, my affinity for the film has dwindled, but that does not discredit the pleasure I had in watching it for the first time. As a whole La La Land was a captivating sensory adventure that was pleasing from start to finish.""""Barry Lyndon"" is a coming-of-age story with the Kubrick touch, so nothing you've ever seen before. It is the story of an Irish boy whose life takes him to roads he'd never think he'd get in, nor does the viewer. Instead of the classic story of growth and overcoming of one's own limits, with ""Barry Lyndon"" Kubrick gives us his customary pessimistic view over the need for control of the human beings over fate or, in other words, the unfathomable number of variables that can change one's life in an instant. Almost comically, the viewer gets used to Barry's continuous shifts from luck to bad fortune in the first half hour, so that the rest of the (long) movie can be played with both the author and the addressee conscious of the rules. The setting in the XVIII century cannot be random: Kubrick alludes to that historic age in almost everyone of his films because it's the purest moment of coexistence of reason and passion, reality and staged society, some of the director's most beloved themes.
Kubrick's attention to detail and maniacal perfection in cinematography could even make the movie unbearable for some. Every single shot in three hours of film are blatantly studied and show conceitedly how amazingly the light is used throughout the scenes: most shots are filmed solely with the use of natural light and/or candles, something any other film-maker would've thought utterly impossible (and it would have been, if Kubrick hadn't had the permission to use new lenses produced by NASA!). There is a continuous use of reverse zoom to ""paint"" in front of the audience's eyes pictures which reveal more of the scene as the lens widens. The use of music is also noticeable, with classic tunes employed for superb emotionally resonant editing cuts (I'm thinking about a specific one near the end about Barry's child).
""Barry Lyndon"" is where the audience can see how one of Kubrick's greatest talents was to mold his actors into the kind of actors needed for a specific film. In this one, every single character has a certain immobility to him, as if an actual painting was brought to life just as long as it is necessary for the narration. Many scenes are simply frozen, with just one character talking or doing something, and even then the movements are perfectly calibrated and artificial, as if instead of actors Kubrick bought machines for his film. This rule is suddenly broken in moments of rage or pain where the camera becomes shaky and the scene confused too.
""Barry Lyndon"" is a fantastic example of Kubrick's maniacal perfection in shooting and between his best works, although not as emotionally or intellectually groundbreaking as his VERY best.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Academy Award gave the Best Actress Oscar to Brie Larson in this film about a young woman Joy who was imprisoned in a certain shed together with her five-year-old son Jack who was born in captivity by an old man entitled ""Room"".No question that many critics and viewers alike found it to be a wonderful film.Director Lenny Abrahamson provides an emotional journey of Joy as well as Jack and how she managed to use her intelligence,imagination and creativity to relieve herself of their situation especially in bringing up her son Jack inside the shed and how they cope and adapt to the outside world after being in captivity for many years.Jacob Tremblay,Joan Allen,Sean Bridgers and William H. Macy also stars in it.
No question that it was touching movie during the first part of the film.We get to see how Joy to remedy their situation with the use of their imagination especially when Joy teaches many things about the world to Jack.Things become extremely difficult especially as Jack gets old and shows above average intelligence.At the beginning of the movie,we see the pain and suffering she has to go through as well as her determination to survive despite their situation.Being an overprotective mother,she also tries to satisfy sexually her captor Old Nick in exchange for their various items for her son. Luckily,they were able to remedy their situation and found a way to escape.
While the movie was compelling the first part, the second part somehow fell short as it wasn't as interesting unlike when Joy and Jack were kept in the shed.When Joy reunited with her parents, I felt that the screenplay focused too on the emotional mother-and-daughter relationship between Joy and Jack and losing sight somewhat on the progress of the story as many issues were left for the audience to think about and discuss among themselves.That includes difficulties they are about to face upon adapting to the outside world after many years of captivity;how Joy's father is going to accept Jack knowing that it was fathered by Old Nick;how Joy is going to go on with her new life as woman in her 20's;and the difficulties Jack as a child is trying face to adapt to his ""new world"" outside the shed.It would have been a masterpiece if not too many questions were left for the audience to answer and some issues were explored further for the continuation of the story.They could have at least shown a character development in both Joy and Jack from inside to outside the shed.
Overall,Room was worth the price of admission despite the progress of the story was lacking in the second part after the escape.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay captured the mother-and-daughter relationship perfectly.No question that Brie Larson deserved to win the Best Actress Oscar as the viewer will definitely empathize with her character Joy.Jacob Tremblay developed a wonderful chemistry with Larson although he could be annoying at times.He also showed strength emotionally to her mom especially in times of emotional pain and difficulties outside the shed.Their performances for me was so great that it somehow made me gave it the highest rating despite the second part.Finally,the viewers will definitely be touched with this movie experience especially for women around the world as the theme of motherhood was fully explored especially even in the most difficult and adverse circumstances.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Butch and Kid after couple of troubles get to organize a gang and went out robbing trains but meanwhile as they find out they are being followed, they go on a run for days and finally decide to leave for Bolivia. Story of Butch and Kid was well organized and always put something new to keep things interesting all the time. It had a great action sequences that are followed by some interesting story and subplot that was something to look forward to. At points in the beginning scenes when they are escaping and going through wilderness it felt like there was to much scenes of that and it felt like it could have been shorter. Etta is women that went with them to Bolivia and she was comfort for both of them and it gets weird how they manage their relationship between them. In Bolivia they decide they could rob banks but after some time Butch wants to get rid of that and lead a normal life. It didn't last long and they returned for last one rob and determined to return to USA they got recognized and now whole army is after them. Last moments of the movie are spectacular with many violent and shooting scenes and as they fight with them they begin to believe they are winning. Final scene when they run out was a very nice touch to end of story. Originality of the movie and script is at point and there is a great deal of investment into westerns in the movie and also cinematography is insanely good. Newman and Redford proved they are strong characters. 8.9/10""We must start with the foundation statement that this is not an historical retelling of the story of early America. We don't know what went on at that time, so we are off the mark at the beginning. Can you imagine the dark times that were involved in this era, with a group of settlers trying to establish some kind of community, and a Native American presence confused and afraid what was going on. So what Disney did was turn this into a folk tale which oral traditions have been doing forever (e.g. Paul Bunyan or John Henry or, more appropriately, Davey Crockett). I mean they sing and talk to trees. The romance had to be very strained. Throw in the search for gold and the greed, and you have a classic love in the face of barriers story. Also, there are a couple of terrific songs in this film. No, it's not ""The Lion King"" but many very good films are not ""The Godfather"" either. It doesn't mean they can't stand on their own.""Now, I presume the first thing that comes to mind in association with Pixar is whimsical characters, and family-friendly characters, and while this film also conforms to that, my God, the underlying setting is just incredible.
A sentient garbage disposal robot roaming around a vacant Earth after resources have been depleted and mass evacuation has occurred? A really poignant setting once you analyse it properly.
Once again Pixar have succeeded in anthropomorphizing non-human characters with each robot having a personality of their own. What I admire about this film is how much they rely on visuals rather than dialogue. For the most part, the robots take centre stage interacting with each other with minimal speech.
The second act focuses mainly on the human characters drifting in space on board what is essentially a space Ark. Accustomed to this self-gratifying lifestyle where they're literally being served everything they want by robots, the obese human race have succumbed to a world of distraction, as it were, where they're surrounded by distracting advertisements and screens, which is a scary visualization of the future.
WALL-E and EVE, the two robotic protagonists are very charming and the dynamic between them is adorable to watch.
Thomas Newman's score just fully captures the environment, making you feel the weight of the setting. There's one musical cue that affects me on an emotional level, as pathetic as that sounds.
Overall, this is one of Pixar's best films to date, despite the fact that the environmental message is a little heavy-handed.""A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.
Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.
But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.
""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""
This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.
In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.
There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.
I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!
8/10""Wreck It Ralph is the best video game movie ever made. While it is not based on any real game (just a bunch of video game characters), it still embodies everything good about video games and arcades. It provides the heart of a Pixar movie with the colors and fun of some of the best Disney movies.
Good: The voice acting is perfect all around. John C Reilly is great as the titular character giving him a lot of heart despite his enormous appearance. Sarah Silverman as Vanellope von Schweetz worked surprisingly as she gives her character heart without being too annoying. Jack MacBrayer and Jane Lynch provide great voice work as well with their characters. Alan Tudyk is so much fun as King Candy. The world building is fantastic as each fake game has enough time to build up the environment, gameplay, and supporting characters. The video game references are used when needed to help in building the world and providing some fan service.
Bad: The chief nitpick is that it comes close to Pixar quality, but it doesn't quite reaches that goal.
Overall, while it is short of being the kind of emotional film like a Wall-E, but it has the humor, heart, and fun to continue this new golden era for Disney.""1986. In a rural district of South Korea, two women have been recently raped and murdered. Working on the case are detectives Park Doo-man and Cho Yong-koo. Their efforts are impeded by some sloppy crime scene procedure by the police. Their methods of solving cases are also quite basic, essentially amounting to beating confessions out of suspects. All this leads to nothing and the police chief brings in a more sophisticated and intelligent detective from Seoul, Seo Tae-yoon. With his arrival the methods improve but they still don't have the killer. Then another woman is found murdered and a pattern emerges...
Gripping drama from writer-director Joon-ho Bong. Intriguing from the start, and the intrigue ramps the more you get into it. Gritty, realistic and certainly doesn't glamorize detective work - so many red herrings and dead ends!
Quite funny at times too. The methods of the local detectives are sometimes very farcical and the director makes the most of these moments of comedy.
Very powerful and thought-provoking ending. As with the remainder of the plot, not at all predictable or formulaic.
Solid performances, especially from the two leads, Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim.""After watching the trailer I got excited for watching the Storks movie and the promises where at least 'good fun'. Storks is undoubtedly funny and keeps up with the audience attention just enough in spite of an at par performance in pretty much all departments. Let me start by saying that I don't this film is a 10/10 but hopefully my rating will add to its overall rating. This is a best cartoon for family.
Stork Mountain was a place known for delivering babies and its employees are primarily storks, along with a few other birds. Their current CEO, a stork named Hunter (Kelsey Grammar), discontinued the baby delivering business, seeing more profit by having storks operate a parcel delivery service called Cornerstore.
Tulip (Katie Crown), having just turned 18 years old, is working to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, but they always backfire. Meanwhile Junior (Andy Samberg), Cornerstore's top delivery stork, is about to be promoted to boss of Cornerstore while Hunter is the boss of cornerstone now and he will be chairman of the board. Hunter demand Junior to fire Tulip but Junior cannot find the heart to fire Tulip due to her kindness and hard work, and he lies to her that she is being transferred to the mail room, instructing her to never leave her new office space.
Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner (Anton Starkman) feels lonely because his parents, Henry (Ty Burrell) and Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), are too busy to spend time with him and he want to have another brother. Nate Gardner found ad about old stork deliver baby and he writes a letter asking for a baby brother with ninja skills and sends it to Cornerstore. The letter makes its way to Tulip, who reluctantly leaves the mail room to put the letter in a slot just outside the room despite Junior's attempt to stop her, injury his wing in the process. To their surprise, a baby girl is created inside a metal container, whom they later name Diamond Destiny.
Junior agrees to secretly help deliver Diamond Destiny. As Junior's wing is broken, they use Tulip's flying machine for transportation. However, they crash into a frozen tundra and they met group of wolfs who leaders named Alpha (Keegan-Michael Key) and Beta (Jordan Peele). The two manage to save Diamond Destiny, whom the wolves have fallen in love with baby. At last, Junior, Tulip and baby diamond escape from group of wolfs.
Back at Cornerstore, a pigeon employee named Toady (Stephen Kramer Glickman) learns of Diamond Destiny's existence. Toady told Hunter about the baby then he promises to give Toady Junior's position as the boss as they scramble the coordinates Junior and Tulip have been following to mislead them to a different location. Junior is captured and tied up by Hunter and his cronies at the false location and they kidnap Diamond Destiny. While Tulip follow the Jasper to her lost family. However, Tulip comes to rescue Junior without having met her family and the two resend themselves back to Cornerstore. After fighting an army of penguins, Junior and Tulip are chased into the abandoned baby making room and start up the machine as a distraction. As thousands of babies are being made, Hunter angrily confronts Junior and Tulip with a large robotic machine, but Junior refuses to surrender Diamond Destiny with Hunter's re-offered promotion. With the infant's playfulness, Junior and Tulip are able to cause the machine along with Hunter to fall off the cliff elevating the collapsing Cornerstore.
Junior rallies the storks, as well as the other birds, to help deliver the babies to the families who wanted them including the Gardners, and Nate accepts having a sister when he realizes that she has the ninja skills he asked for in the letter. The storks, former employees of Cornerstore, and the wolf pack reunite Tulip with her expanded family, and she and Junior continue their job of delivering babies as co-bosses of Stork Mountain.""I have yet to see a bad Guy Ritchie film. He just doesn't seem to get his formula wrong ever. It is a well thought, smart comedy which will keep your attention right till the end. You can tell it is a Guy Ritchie film by the similarities it bore to Lock, Stock. But this one definitely stands its own ground.
This movie is paced so quick, each part written so well, edited so brilliant, you really don't want to miss a single scene. The story ties in really well with the different characters and each of their own subplots. I can not pinpoint my favourite actor in this movie. Every actor has done a brilliant job. I have to say, if nothing, watch this movie for the dog that squeaks. Those scenes are downright hilarious.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is Quote: d in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.
Oskar Schindler was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Kraków Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""
It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbor any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.
With the arrival of Amon Goeth, a Hauptsturmführer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""
This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and- white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.
This is a great movie. Its realism, depth, and willingness to touch on sensitive and dark topics cannot go unnoticed. It is one of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, and for good reason. Few movies draw out such emotion from the viewers. It is movies like this that will hopefully keep humans from committing such atrocities against each other in the future.""Whether one supports what Snowden did or not, this movie is watchable, well made and well acted.
Before this movie I wasn't that familiar with what he actually disclosed except that it was overreaching by the NSA spying on everyone including innocent people and friendly countries and their heads of state like Angela Merkel. Oliver Stone does a good job of showing Snowden's story from his beginnings in cyber security to his disillusionment. By the end of the movie the point is clear - the NSA was spying on people for reasons beyond terrorism like economic gain. And the point of the people disclosing the scandal is that invasion of privacy violates our civil rights and undermines freedom and democracy. Also cover up by the NSA CIA and the administration is shown. So the case in support of disclosure is made. For completeness I would have liked some characters arguing against disclosure like if the disclosures compromised terrorist surveillance and let the main characters rebut their arguments.
It helps to watch Citizenfour before or at least know what about the main disclosures because the characters speak very fast and sometimes the viewer can get lost during the technical dialog. Maybe some narration would have helped.
Joseph Gordon Levitt now slightly older looking does a good job of imitating Snowden's voice and manner. He portrays him as calm logical intelligent and sure that what he is doing is right. Shaliene Woodley plays his loyal girlfriend Lindsay.
Nice on location filming around the world including Hong Kong.
Even for people who can't decide if he is a hero or not this eye opening movie make the viewer think about how much we are all being watched. Also about the consequences of whistle blowing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** All right, my review is a little late, and for that I apologize. I wanted to make sure my pure fanboyism over Star Wars didn't take completely over. Unfortunately, this was an awesome Star Wars movie, and while it did have a few faults, they were so minor in my opinion that they did not take away from the sheer awesomness of this movie.
Grade: 10/10, A+
Does this movie truly deserve a 10/10 grade? That's debatable, and if you don't think it deserves that, I can completely understand. But everything in this movie worked for me, other than a few minor things, but as I don't grade on aesthetics, I can't really fault the movie for them. Should the movie have had an opening crawl with the Star Wars theme? Yes, it should have. Did it truly, completely need it? No, it did not. Should the movie have been scored by John Williams? Yes. Did it truly, completely need John Williams? No.
Story: 10/10 You cannot fault the story in any way, shape or form. Everything you needed to know to tell the story completely was there. There was nothing missing, there were no plot holes, and the character development was great considering these were characters never mentioned again in the later movies. Every part of this movie led to the fantastic conclusion which was awe-inspiring in its greatness.
Character Development: 10/10 Considering how the movie ends, and the fact the characters in this movie are never mentioned later, the character development for them all was pretty solid. Could it have been better? Of course. But it's not really enough to take points away for. I liked all the characters in this movie-- some more than others, yes--but everyone served their purpose and did what they had to to make this an exciting experience for me.
Directing: 10/10 Gareth Edwards, who brought us Godzilla 2014, had me a bit nervous as the director, because he famously had a Godzilla movie that barely had Godzilla in it. So I didn't really know what to expect from Rogue One. All I can say is, you did a damn fine job, Gareth, and I hope you do another Star Wars movie later. He told a great story here.
Casting: 10/10 Great cast! Everyone was perfect in their role and I liked everyone immensely!
Acting: 10/10 Everyone played their parts perfectly!
Cinematography: 10/10 Some people might have a problem with parts of the CGI in this movie, and again, I can't fault you if you did. But to me, every part was almost perfect, including the two fully CGI actors who should not have been in the movie but thankfully were. No spoilers, though I'm sure almost everyone has seen the movie by now. Again, perhaps not perfect, but it shows what Hollywood will be capable of--and in a way, that's rather scary.
Music: 10/10 Michael Giacchino is not John Williams, but considering his scored this movie in 4 weeks is phenomenal in and of itself. So, I'll cut him some slack for that. The music was still very Star- Warsy, and while it may not have been as memorable as John Williams' music, it was still darn good. I can't take away points when he gave us something still spectacular in such a short time.
Pacing: 10/10 Did not want to fall asleep once in this movie. It started off with a bang and kept going to a very thrilling and unexpected, jaw-dropping climax.
Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Everything felt and looked just like something should in a Star Wars movie. Great job!
Enjoyment: 10/10 If I could, I'd probably give my enjoyment a 13/10 because I really loved this movie. It was the first Star Wars movie that didn't have anything geared towards kids in it. No Gungans, no Ewoks, not cute and cuddly creatures. This was a movie about a mission, and that mission was awesome and dark and grim and more than I was expecting it to be. Gareth Edwards outdid himself in my opinion.
To show how this movie ranks against the other Star Wars movies, I'll post all my scores below:
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - 10/10 Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens - 9.6/10 Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back - 9.6/10 Star Wars IV: A New Hope - 9.6/10 Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi - 9.0/10 Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith - 8.5/10 Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones - 8.1/10 Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace - 7.8/10
Before anyone says anything, I had a few problems with Empire and A New Hope that were enough to keep me from putting them above Force Awakens. None of the movies were perfect, but Force Awakens I just enjoyed more, which is why it has the same grade but is placed above Empire and A New Hope.""If you are not a fan of the original then you are never gonna make this more than a 7. But if you are then I cant see how this could have been better made. Not too reverential, not too nostalgic, all the right queues and the characters all behaving exactly as they would have done 20 years later with the return of Renton. It was funny, exciting, sad and just plain brilliant. The writing from Danny Boyle is consummate and the performances from all the stars exceptional. Plus a great performance from SickBoys new girlfriend. I took my wife, 20 year old daughter and 23 year old son to see it and all of us said it was as good as we had hoped for and and that we could not see how it could have been improved upon. In fact, that we could all have stayed in the cinema and watched it straight round again - that's never happened before! See it before you see too many clips!""29 years after its Broadway premiere, ""Fences"" arrives in theatres courtesy of a screenplay by the late playwright August Wilson himself. With two Pulitzer Prizes and his ten-play magnum opus, ""The Pittsburgh Cycle,"" (of which ""Fences"" is the sixth work), Wilson takes his rightful place alongside Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams as one of the greatest American playwrights. The focus of Wilson's cycle is African-American life across the entire 20th century, with each play taking place in a particular decade. ""Fences"" is set in the 1950's, but the time frame does not date the material. Its universal themes supersede any of its societal details, though based on this year's election cycle, viewers may be stunned to discover that the American working class is more than just Midwestern and White.
Denzel Washington as Director realises that the greatest star in this film is its writing composition. It focuses briefly on a Garbage collector Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) who holds court in the backyard of the Pittsburgh home he shares with his wife, Rose (Viola Davis) and their son, Cory (Jovan Adepo). At the point when a film has Actors this focused on talking their lines, to the point where it appears they are turning themselves back to front with anguish, the camera is dependably precisely where it should be. It is with them, tuning in as eagerly as we in the crowd seem to be. This kind of heading is an under-appreciated skill these days, inspiring an earlier time when experts like Billy Wilder and Sidney Lumet carried out their special-ties. Truth be told, it was Wilder who shunned the thought that garish, gaudy course was what made for awesome dramatisation, saying that if ""something were said to be very much coordinated, that is verification that it is definitely not."" Washington comprehends this, and ""Fences"" is considerably more capable for his commitment to his on-screen characters' speciality. At the point when Viola Davis is demonstrating to you how hard her heart is breaking, the camera doesn't should vie for your consideration.
""Fences"" is a film about how our surroundings shapes us, and how, regardless of how honourable their aims, our folks can't resist the urge to destroy us in some form, similarly as their folks had accomplished for them. This is our legacy as people. Possibly we influence ourselves against that which we saw as amiss with our folks, or we get their ailment and we pass it on. Washington's visual reiteration of crosses all through the film, either on the divider or in the chain Rose wears around her neck, is an indication of the best father-child story ever told. This thought is in the script as well: maybe the most mercilessly legitimate thing Rose tells Cory close to the film's end is that he's much the same as Troy. Particularly after Cory's discourse about how he made a decent attempt to expel Troy's unnerving impact from his spirit. Cory's acknowledgement of this truth, spoke to in his co-selecting of the tune Troy used to sing, is as appalling as it is lovely. Regardless of whether we need it or not, this is our legacy.
Denzel Washington coordinates and stars in a towering screen adaptation of August Wilson's play about an imperfect inward city patriarch. It's convincing, additionally beats the substantial with the significance.""In short if you know deadpool if you read the comics and enjoyed them over the years then you will love this movie, they really did get it spot on to how it should have been made, almost like a 90s made for TV movie but with a bigger budget, it suits deadpool 100% If you don't read the comics, don't like deadpool or don't know who he is then you will likely become one of the sour adults reviewing this with 1 star and complaining that it simply isn't funny and probably throwing out a few insults to those that enjoy the comics and/or the movie.
If you didn't read the comics and still enjoyed it then kudos to you, you are not easily offended like some of these ancients giving it bad reviews because they didn't get what was funny about it.""Ben Affleck has risen above his initial introduction...His maturity is showing and his street smarts from being a kid from Boston have helped to keep him grounded.
This movie isn't a new idea but, it did expand my knowledge of crime in Miami during Prohibition and its sordid nature...Ben is really improving as a director. Bem is becoming more and more the master of understated. He's really hard not to like and his actors seem to be giving their best. I would give this movie a 10 but, If I watch a movie to the end, it's usually a good one and I give them 10's because they deserve it...I gave an eight because it's not perfect...Few things are.
I really don't see any unforgivable sins in this piece...It was interesting and enjoyable viewing! I like the message too. :)...""Don't listen to the critics(they critic the hard work of others, 15000 people worked at this movie)! ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" is unbelievable with the great Tim Burton as director, great actors, great story, great music, great special effects and leaves you with the feeling of wanting moooore, I can't wait for the sequel to see Emma, Jake and Miss Peregrine again! From the beginning to the end you sit tight in your chair,armchair or sofa and feel overwhelmed by the mystery and the beauty of the story, because the movie goes on as a adventure through the supreme imagination that lets you be a part of it. At the end I stood, shocked and amazed by this beautiful movie, looking at the credits.Watch this movie and enjoy 2 hours of childhood!""Oliver Stone is such a great director. He's succeeded once again in producing an interesting and sympathetic historical movie, this time about the Edward Snowden whistle-blowing story. His movies are so credible, so finely crafted, so watchable.
It is a pleasure to just sit back and let Stone show Snowden's story to you. I can't imagine anyone ever producing a Snowden movie that is better than this one. I felt the story was presented objectively and neutrally. Only near the end did the political aspect become a little too much. Yes, Stone is taking a pro-Snowden position and is trying to convince you that his position is right. If you are unable to emotionally handle that didactic aspect, don't see this movie.
Can I also talk about Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The man is clearly a great actor with enormous range. He's been in dozens of movies now, and his performances in each of them have been excellent. He really does capture Snowden in this movie. Kudos to him, Stone and everyone else involved in this film.""I was so enthusiastic to see this film I went into this movie with very high expectations! Rogue One was unbelievable! I loved the story. I loved the new characters and peripheral creatures and oddities. I loved the performance from Felicity Jones and most of all I loved the action! I was in awe of the battles and adrenaline packed sequences. The design and look of this film is beautiful and breath-taking. This movie franchise, when done properly, is the best movie franchise ever created. The creativity and imagination is second to none and stimulates the audience like nothing else can. I would recommend everyone with a heartbeat and a pulse see this film! And anyone who writes a negative or hateful review of this movie is just someone who enjoys pissing on what so many other people enjoy. Don't give these folks your attention.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** By now...Everyone knows the twist that pops up at the end of Split so there is no need for me to even talk about it yet again here for this review...
Instead...I wanna talk about the backstory that critics and fans keep saying didn't need to be there...And to be completely honest...It's bugging me quite a bit...
The backstory I'm talking about is that of Casey Cooke played by Anya Taylor-Joy...The story goes into her past for reasons that seem to float right pass the audience...
Question: Why did Casey tell her friend who was about to be dragged into the next room by the kidnapper to ""Wet"" herself..??
Answer: Because as Casey's backstory reveals...Her Uncle was/is a monster/pedophile and once that is revealed..The audience should have realized that wetting herself was a sad but somewhat useful weapon to use against her Uncle...And sure enough when her friend and fellow captor took Casey's advice...It killed the mood for the kidnapper...
There was only one scene that I wish had been edited differently...And that was the scene when a 5 year old Casey played Izzie Coffey was pointing the shotgun at her Uncle...The fact that the Uncle was able to get the gun away from her should NOT have been used...
If the scene had played up until the point where the audience thinks she is about to shoot him but then jumps back to present time...That would have given Casey's final scene a much more powerful impact...Particularly when the police officer lets Casey know that her Uncle had arrived...
Only then should the audience have realized that Casey hadn't actually pulled the trigger because the Uncle had managed to get it away from her...
For this reason alone...I give this film 9 out of 10 stars...Other than that...Casey's backstory was extremely vital to the entire movie and I really wish people could understand that and see it as clearly as I do...
And That's All There Is Too It...""Captain Fantastic (2016), from director Matt Ross is a highly emotive family drama, which is special in it's own way, not like your average ""every day"" movie.
It's about family that refuses to live by today's ""rules and standards"", and goes on to live in nature. Whole casting, along with main star Viggo Mortensen is fantastic! You really believe they are family, that takes you to a adventure with them, through self-discovery, inner fight with themselves for their way of life and philosophy, fight with others who don't agree with them, and possible mistakes. Movie establishes great question, which is: Is it better to be protected by lies or faced with the truth? And gives it's answer to that question. Vigo Mortensen (father) has his own inner fight in which he is faced with question is he a good father, would his children have better life without him.
This movie is decorated by beautiful cinematography, because of beautiful shots of nature, but also there are shots of urban cities and industry, in comparison of those shots is point of this movie. And the point is: what means to be normal family and does normal family needs to fit in today's patterns of society, to be normal? Music in movie is also great, because in every moment it helps audience to awake feeling which director is aiming for. Movie is paced very well, and in it's 2 hours it never got boring.
In conclusion beautiful film for whole family, that brings real values of life on screen, and shows audience what it means to be true family in both good and bad times.""Best film I've seen this year so far.
Superb storytelling , fortunately I watched this having not known the actual story beyond the headline. It meant all the drama and revelations were real to me .
Superb acting , directing and special effects . The Tom Hanks / Clint Eastwood combination was a match made in Hollywood perfection . Great supporting acting by Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn.
A human story , a triumph over adversity , a battle against the system , huge respect for the rescue services , makes you think of the events of 11/9/01
I'm a great fan of the 90 minute movie , if you can tell a story in 90 minutes why run to 120 ? And there's an added bonus in the final credits so stay around till the end
Best film of 2017 so far so why have the award ceremonies overlooked it ?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When a fashion designer like Tom Ford becomes a director, should we call him a film designer? In a certain way, his films look as if they are designed rather than directed. Like his first feature film, 'A Single Man', this follow-up is the ultimate manifestation of good taste. Clothing, interior design, art, lighting, music, even the cars: it's all carefully chosen and selected. Ford creates his own world of elegance and harmony, in which not a single element is ugly or out of place. And even when something ugly turns up, it is made into an aesthetic statement, as the hilarious and quite daring opening scene proves.
In 'Nocturnal Animals', this seemingly perfect world is inhabited by rich art dealer Susan. Although she has no reason to be unhappy, she is. And she has herself to blame for it. In the course of the film, we learn what the reason is for her unhappiness: she feels empty after having made a crucial decision she now seems to regret.
This reality is coming back to haunt her, when she receives a novel by post, written by her ex-husband. While she reads the book and gets gradually more upset by its content, the viewer reads it together with her. Not in text, but in images: the book is the screenplay for a film-in-the film. Susan's urban, elegant world of well-behaved, civilized people contrasts sharply with the raw, indiscriminate violence in the Texan desert, described in the book.
The film-in-the-film is a neo-western, complete with hostile rednecks, a Stetson-wearing sheriff, and a landscape of endless two-lane highways crossing the emptiness. The first scene of this subplot is nothing more than perfect in its bleak agony.
The frequent switches between the real world and the book story add extra depth to the film. This is enhanced when a third perspective is introduced: flashbacks from the time Susan and her ex-husband met and fell in love. Ford weaves the three stories together without any effort, and at any moment it's clear which perspective we're in.
The result is a thriller with an extra layer of psychological drama, all shown in wonderful, beautiful cinematography. But 'Nocturnal Animals' is not an empty, cold, display of style. Quite on the contrary. Tom Ford almost condemns the emptiness of Susan's art world, full of hypocrites and devoid of real emotions. He shows how real feelings are much more important than pretense, that failure and dissent are to be preferred over perfection and harmony. It's almost as if he got fed up with the flashy fashion world, and chose a much more profound way of expressing his art.""I guess I should say I didn't like ""Whiplash"" at all. Or, to be more precise, it was a pretty interesting watch for anyone who's into music in general and jazz in particular. But, on the whole, in my view - a really thin piece of cinema. But this one 
Didn't expect it from Chazelle, but it's  simply  beautiful. Not only is it a virtually perfect movie, which carries you along all the way through while surprising at every turn to totally carry away at the end, it's the most beautiful, moving and genuine work I've seen in some really ""serious"" while. And, as far as I'm concerned, somewhat misunderstood on the both sides of the barricade. That is it has little to do with writing a love letter to Hollywood  for which Hollywood seems to like it so much and so many other people seem to just as seriously hate it (or to modern Hollywood, at any rate  while old Hollywood here should rather be read as a metaphor) . Nor is it supplemented with a forced or 'artsy' finale  another reason for this hate  because it's not just a romantic story. As far as I can see this movie is about so many other things as well. It's about chance and fate, personal happiness and personal integrity, following signs and making your own choices, freedom and responsibility. It's about cause and effect, dreams and reality. About whether this reality is ""benignly indifferent"" or can be 'on your side'. About what it ultimately is. And what it takes to find and walk your own path through it.
It's impeccably written, immaculately executed and perfectly structured in dramatic terms. The intonation is flawless, no wrong notes. Always organically dramatic, never melodramatic. Good performances (especially Stone). Don't quite remember the last time I saw such meaningful cuts  Eisenstein would be proud. And the last note does last  when the show was through I somehow couldn't get away from the theater and roamed for hours in circles in the vicinity. Then got back for no reason and just sat there in the lobby until they had to drive me out at night. So the stuff stays with you  to say the least -:).
Anyways, if you haven't yet, go and see it. It's there. It's cinema. Not sure about Fellini's ""aerodromes"" but it looks like some of his random ""planes"" are still in the air. Hooah!
And a piece of advice  watch the credits up to the very end.""Hrithik Roshan proved that if given a brilliant script that has a scope to perform, he will nail it and that's what he has done with 'Kaabil'. He played a role of a blind man with so much conviction that the character looks real. His helplessness of not being able to get justice on his wife's murder is touching. Guess he gives his finest performances when he plays a physically challenged role. 'Koi Mil Gaya' and 'Guzaarish' were exceptionally good.
The very beautiful Yami Gautam just steals the show. Her chemistry with Hrithik is just like a steaming mug of coffee. From the beginning of the film, you will be in awe of their brewing love story. Narendra Jha and Girish Kulkarni are good as investigative tough cops. Suresh Menon is good in his small role.Special mentions to the villainous Roy brothers who will make you feel disgusted with their evil acts. The two are just a visual treat on screen. Kaabil' is overwhelming, magical and a feel good film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a must see! we loved it. Before seeing this movie, i could not figure how they could make a movie (2 hours) on this event. but they did and pulled it off with such greatness. The best scene of the movie is when they question the wife. i loved Mark Wahlburg, (sp), John Goodman and Kevin Beacon. all of these actors were great. the movie got me and my wife chocked up at times, which rarely happens to me.
God Bless the City of Boston, the Police Dept, FBI, Mayor, Gov, the Boston Public, and most importantly...the families that were effected by this horrible day.
...and GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF America.""To start off the review I should mention that I am an 18 year old male university student and I can say that I enjoyed this movie. When most animated movies state that they are for the whole family, they often are quite childish and boring for the older members, but I can gladly say that this movie would be enjoyable for all ages. For example there are jokes that might be wasted on the younger children that gave me a laugh. The scenery for this movie is beautiful, serene even. What worked for Tangled and Frozen definitely worked for Moana. The voice acting was ideal, beautiful singing voice from Moana. Really emotive singing and meaning behind the lyrics, while respecting the Polynesian background. The movie is simply a feel good movie, great storyline that is easy to follow but isn't spoon feeding the audience. If there was to be a negative, it would be that the main characters did not really develop their friendship, there was little character development from Moana and that the movie was quite short in comparison. Regardless, it is a great movie that I will be watching again. Fantastic job Disney!""I generally don't like to accuse people who don't like a well received movie of ""not getting it."" But after reading several negative user reviews, I'm convinced people did not get Silence.
Silence is not telling you the priests are doing the right thing. It is not telling you that Japan is evil. It is not telling people to convert to Christianity. It is merely portraying historical fictitious events as they happen and it does so masterfully.
Silence portrays a priest struggling with whether he should apostatize (renounce his faith) and save other's lives, or to let them die, appearing selfish, for what he believes is right. Now you may think that one side is right but Scorsese presents both sides showing that it is a gray area. It is less about religion and more about the cost of your beliefs making it more powerful than most movies.
People complain about the run time. Those people were watching it, not experiencing it. The run time is long, but it is for a reason. Many similar scenes seem to repeat, however in between each the movie introduces a new idea so when you see it again it inflicts a different mood and different opinion. Taking a viewer and putting them in the story and experience the events is true storytelling. If you check your phone, you are only gipping yourself of a great experience.
In addition to what's been already said, it's important to point out that the slew of reviewers claiming ""this is NOT good film making or good basic storytelling"" are completely ignorant to film. You can say you don't like it but ignoring the fact that this has an amazing score, some of the most beautiful camera work and cinematography, Garfield's amazing method acting and at least presenting beliefs in an objective matter.
Silence is a flawless movie. If you don't just watch it but experience it, it will captivate you.""First of all I want to say I really liked this movie ,Benedict cumberbatches acting in this is amazing . I felt I had to write this review due to many poor reviews from small minded people .many people critice how true this story is.The start says it's based on a real story which it is ,but it's a movie all the same and of course there gonna add pieces of interesting information to make it more entertaining for the viewer,which they do excellently .We can without a doubt say that Bendict cumberbatch is one of the best actors you'll ever come across,this movie a prime example of this (I also recommend watching him in Sherlock too)
All in all this movie was good from start to finish although having flaws an enjoyable watch all the same""I am speechless... This is just one of the best movies ever made. Ridley Scott, you've done well... Mixing such an old, boring plot with new elements, making it better than the both of the things.
Sigounery Weever is a great actor in this! She shows that gender for a protagonist really doesn't matter. The xenomorph alien looks so scary! It is one of the scariest movie monsters ever to exist in movie history!
This is both a sci-fi and horror film, and perfectly balances between the two, like, I can't even, OK?
10/10. There is nothing wrong with it. This movie is an absolute masterpiece.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Having written a review for The Godfather it feels, when thinking about it, like a travesty not to write a review for the sequel; The Godfather Part II. Especially after having written my first review such a long time ago, however I have to say that I'm not that much into writing reviews hence the reason I've only written one. But I've decided I will give it a fair shot although I'm wondering how many people will even read it.
It should of course go without saying that this isn't as much of a sequel as it is a continuation of the first film, calling it a sequel is to underestimate the importance of this film. As masterfully done as the first one it's for me extremely difficult to actually pick one over the other, the only reason I have The Godfather higher than Part II is not because it's better but because of it being the beginning of the journey, the very introduction to this world, if you'll call it that. (Brando's magnificent performance may also have something to do with this) In The Godfather Part 2 Michael Corleone has, as we all know, become the new Don and the film which takes place in the 50's sees Michael becoming corrupt with greed and power. He pretty much becomes just like his father, it's a transformation so interestingly compelling and grandeur that one can't stop but feel sorry for him in some ways. Meanwhile the story of Vito Corleone from childhood to adulthood is chronicled through the use of flashbacks. We see him arrive to America from Sicily, only a child, and how he creates his Mafia empire. The actor portraying him is of course Robert De Niro whose performance is electrifying. These flashbacks are spoken in Italian which I found to be interesting. But while De Niro captures the mannerisms of Don Vito Corleone it's Al Pacino who gives the best performance as Michael Corleone. He's even better here than in the first film, of course this time Marlon Brando wasn't around who could overshadow everyone, and it's only because of his fantastic performance that you're able to feel sorry for him.
Al Pacino was very good in the first film but here he's even greater. The supporting cast is great too; the ever wonderful Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and of course the late John Cazale. The acting is just as great as in the first film. Francis Ford Coppolas directing is amazing as is the cinematography.
There is really nothing more to be said about this masterpiece. I know I'm late with this review, but being someone who never really wrote reviews this is my second but not last one.
And fitting that it should be about my second favorite film and the second greatest in Cinema...""So. I have seen many great films in the passing years, but this was something of a kind. There are many other films that would deserve a review, but i have decided not to write them. This however got me so hyped up that i just had to write this.
It may not be the highest rated movie in my list, but it is really rare for me to give 10 stars. This movie will not be joining those few movies, but i'm still going to give recognition to this one by letting it be the first movie i ever wrote a review about.
The reason for that is simple. This was amazing movie that had incredible acting and a very dark, but highly interesting plot. The characters had depth in them and the movie itself gave you many ways to interpret it. And for me, that is a very important thing. Many of the movies that give you more than one way to interpret it are on the way to become classics. Usually it is the ending, but in this one there is many scenes through out the movie.
In Whiplash, i mostly mean the ending of the movie like i just stated, but the spark for that incredible ending scene comes through the entire film. Which is just great.
I also have to give credit to the acting in this movie. J.K. Simmons is in my opinion one of the best actors in the world right now. I am also not quite sure if this movie would have had that high impact it had on me if he wasn't in this one. Just fantastic.
In my opinion this should have been the academic award winning best picture from 2014. After all this is quite possibly one of the best movies of the decade.""Chadwick Boseman is great as James Brown. He captures the man at the various stages of his life and career which cannot be easy to do. Many remember James Brown as he was when THEY saw him, but this movie captures JB when he looked and acted very differently. Check out YouTube videos of the young JB and you see how well Chadwick Boseman did.
it cannot be easy to capture one of the greatest Soul/Funk performers of all time, especially the dancing but Mr Boseman gets it spot on.
It was also good to see James early life and how his childhood shaped the man he was to become. Also the movie does not gloss over the less than nice man JB could be.
Good movie this.""MS Dhoni - The Untold Story is arguably one of the best movie ever made by Bollywood. Never seen such an emotional, spirit full, inspirational and motivational film ever in my life.Just speechless. All credit goes to Neeraj Pandey & Co. The way Sushant Singh portrayed the role of MS Dhoni, he just looked like a zerox copy.
My Views Direction - 5/5 Screenplay - 5/5 Plot - 5/5 (Dhoni's life Story) Cast Selection - 5/5 (Phenomenal) Music - 5/5 Overall - 10/10
Best Quote: - Enter the cinema hall as a Dhoni fan, then go home as a Sushant fan.
Sushant Singh Rajput & Disha Patani & the actors who were the friends of MS Dhoni deserves a standing ovation.""The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non- conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Its a good film to watch all of us. The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.""A well told story of the 60's - fashion, seriousness of the space competition, but more importantly the contributions of 3 women in a time where they were not even given the credit of having a brain. Why this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state. Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And Pharrell for the music.""I'm not the biggest Pink Floyd band (they're in my top 10, but not top 5) nor am I a huge fan of The Wall (it is not in my top 20 albums, nor is it my favorite Pink Floyd album, which is Animals) so my review is not biased by fandom.
This is simply put an incredible musical. Many might argue ""it's not a musical"" but do musicals need to have dancing? Is dancing the definition of musicals?
I'm not a fan of musicals because of dancing, but this film is not a musical without dancing. It's not Broadway and it's not show tunes. It is a rock musical, with a completely different kind of music. The songs are sadder, angrier, more depressed and the picture follows the music.
Show tunes about love make for soapy and sappy films. Sad and angry songs result in a much darker picture.
There are some things I don't like about this film. In the album Pink cheats on his wife, then she leaves him for someone else. This makes Pink the architect of his own misery. In the film, however, Pink first learns of his wife's unfaithfulness before he starts sleeping with groupies. This makes him a victim. But he's already a victim of many things - overprotective mother, school system, lack of father. We don't need another element for his victimhood. They could've used that to give us another side to Pink's personality rather than hammer in the idea of him being a victim.
I also don't like some of the animation. Some of it is great, but the trial, particularly the judge, is a miss.
The additional songs and re-recorded pieces are great. What Shall We Do Now? is one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs.
I wish they would make more films like this, either entirely live action or animated.
This is what musicals should be. 9/10.""Don Cheadle perhaps did the best job of his acting career. With Joaquin Phonex playing a minor role and Gary Busse playing a supporting actor. Based on a true story, and a great film to watch. It has moments of regularity , combined with terror and a bit of comedy to have a film based on true events directed and acting gave the viewer a real sense of what went Down in Rawanda, during the countries genocide & civil war. If you like films based on real people and real events this movie is a must see.The movie does a great job of portraying a real man in Rawanda who helped both Hutu and Tutsi's alike, often putting his own life on the line for others. A very heroic man, portrayed by Cheadle who did the best acting job of his career! I give it 9 stars! Check it out if you have not seen it! The movie is a must see for those interested in movies inspired by real events and the people's actions during a real event!""I loved this movie. It is so strange and bizarre, but beautiful and moving at the same time. This movie is incredibly fun to watch, both actors are incredible, and really make the film come alive. The movie contains a lot of fart jokes, and some not that funny. Don't get me wrong, fart jokes can be hilarious, but this movie takes it to a whole new level. Daniel Kwan and Scheinert take something as simple as a fart joke and transformed its meaning to create something completely new and incredible. A life lesson. They brilliantly fused farting with social acceptableness and interaction. The soundtrack in this movie,which I cannot get enough of, is incredible. It is so weird but so beautiful. This movie is by far one of the most original and creative movies out there, i recommend this movie to everyone.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).
This movie gives us an amazing performance by Jack Nicholson. The Acting and Directing are I'd say an 8.
The music is quite suiting and light in this movie.
For anyone who's looking for an interesting drama film and has the time, this movie is worth your time.
One problem with the film is that it's quite long and at times, draggy. Make-up wise this movie doesn't stand out. However the characters are very difficult and amazingly performed by all of the actors and actresses in this film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Here we have a timeless classic in every sense of the word! Discarded as "" Capracorn"" upon release in 1946, it fizzled at the box office. In the 1970s and Mid 80's the film had fallen into the dreaded public domain, allowing repeated showing for free with anyone with enough power to broadcast a signal. ( To include a highly rebuffed "" colorized"" version in 1986. Thru these grainy showings and pastels there was actually something there- A fantastic story, somehow forgotten thru the years. Word had spread about our beloved George Bailey, his trials and tribulations and rise to redemption and triumph. Jimmy Stewart is fantastic, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore shine and Clearance the Angel is second to none. Burt the Cop,Ernie the Cabby and a host of others round out the story nicely. A staple in our house and I am sure everyone else during Christmas. It never disappoints to get you into the spirit. No man is a failure who has friends...""I'm a huge Nolan fan, and I always get those goosebumps moments in his films where it just HITS me like a ton of bricks: I get this movie. I get the deeper meaning behind it. I get the reason for it. And Nolan sent that message in the most genius way. Wow. It's probably different for different people, but some examples, it was when black merged into white in Memento, it was when Joker was upside down opposite of Batman and talking about human nature, their duality, gravity, etc, it was when the audience discovered the Prestige had been done on us, etc.
However, that doesn't happen for me in Inception. I loved the movie. So unique, so entertaining, but I'm not sure if I truly GET IT. I've seen it like 13 times, and I'll come up with a explanation and an underlying theme, then second-guess it the next time I watch it.
I've read many ""explanations,"" or better yet, interpretations of Inception online, but none made an air-tight case for me. Perhaps that's the reason, obviously he intended ambiguity, but I need more.
At best it's one film where you can have conversations with different groups and all come up with something totally different each time.
Thought provoking at it's finest.""Simply an amazing movie. Well acted, great story. I've seen this 1000 times and still get tears eyed up at the end. Every story keeps you wanting more, and the present breaks your heart. There are few movies I can watch over and over and still get excited to watch again. In my opinion there is simply not a better told story of family and regret. The casting couldn't have been any better. I get involved with the characters at the start and want to embrace the whole family dynamic. More symbolism in this movie than any I could think of. I can't remember why I watched this movie for the first time, but am so glad I did. If you are into fantasy, acting, fun, and want something to awaken your imagination i couldn't suggest a better film. Tim Burton's masterpiece.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Before I begin to write anything about the film, I must state my regret of watching it quite a long time into its release. If I'd read about it and known what the plot revolves around, I sure wouldn 't have taken this long. This is my type of film, because amongst my family, friends and even random strangers, I was for a long time known as an ""Off-label"" psychologist, a friend for problems, till, sadly, very recently when I myself ran into adrenal insufficiency. So I've problems of my own, aplenty actually. Ah' I miss those days, solving people's problems and calming them down to allow them think rationally.... The world is in dearth of people who listen to other 's problems.
So here is me suffering from a sub-clinical depression due to my hypothyroidism not being treated with the sufficient dose, due to the thyroid medicine worsening adrenal problems. So it's like going in unending circles, but minutes after finishing this film I was playing with my nieces, chasing them around in the rooms! That's the effect it had on me!
A breath of fresh air from Bollywood, although that doesn't mean they haven't been making good films of late. It's just the theme that it deals with that isn't that mainstream in that industry. ""Brain, after all, is a part of the human body"" and it is perfectly normal for it to ""Fall ill"". This, these words had the most ever-lasting effect and from then on it becomes a ride, an experience, a film that I feel every viewer would in one way or the other, one incident or happening or the other, feel building a personal connection with him/her; simply because we've all suffered from it at some point in our lives, but just feel afraid of expressing it. So we feel that a film like this does what we wanted to do ourselves but held ourselves back from expressing it. Sometimes it is an underlying illness or hormonal imbalance, sometimes stress at home, work or personal life triggers it, or sometimes even a medicine that you take that might be causing you bouts of depression, but the point stands that depression and anxiety exist as illnesses, just like cancer, tumours and organ failures do. I could picture two very close persons in my mind whilst watching the film upon whom the film would fit 80 to 90%, but therein again lies the greatness of this film. It visits every household.
Alia Bhatt was fantastic in her role. This is her territory and she nails it to be honest. Her past performances in 'Highway' (2014) or 'Udta Punjab' (2016) make it obvious to the film-makers whom to cast for such a role, but I thought this was quite an unusual role for Shah Rukh Khan and he was brilliant in it. He is for a reason amongst the very best of Bollywood's products. A highly capable man!
The film-makers must be commended for building the connection between things. First it all appears to be confusing as a lazy girl goes about her life in a very careless manner, disrespecting people, and losing people and relations, and then a connection is built between her present and her past. Most likable and emotional thing of course was the bit about the drawings that she would draw for her parents. Despite having never been able to study all these aspects of childhood in life, I self-teach myself about things through the Internet and here too,... whenever my nieces bring me a drawing of theirs, even if randomly drawn lines, I'd examine it with them in details and ask them what it is etc. The third thing to love was the bit about her parents of course. No matter who bad they were or are, they're your parents. Respect them, talk to them, spend time with them, express your issues and loves and that'll magically improve the quality of your life. Not for them, but for yourself. Our most natural state is to love them, and by turning away from them we punish ourselves, and them too.
All in all, a must watch film for anyone reading this. This film will surprise you and make you realise the value of life. Go for it!""To be honest, this is the most quotable movie of all time. Take any line from the movie and there you go, you have a Quote: there. Released way back in 1999, this movie is way ahead of its time. The themes portrayed in this film really do strike all emotional chords. The story, direction, screenplay are just flawless.
Coming to the actors, all the actors were fabulous, even the supporting cast. Brad Pitt as always brought charm and style to this movie; Edward Norton gives a performance that you can relate to at all levels. It is not just a thriller, it is more than that. It is a Masterpiece. A movie not to be missed if you are an admirer of great films!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I was a kid, and discovered Spongebob, I immediately fell in love with the show. The first three seasons of the TV show were absolute comedy gold! When the movie was released, I was so excited to see Spongebob on the big screen! I saw it, and it has now become one of my top 5 favorite animated movies of all time!
First up, the characters. The characters that we all know and love from the TV show, are here in full force. The dynamics between Spongebob and Patrick are absolutely hilarious. So many memorable one-liners, my personal favorite being Spongebob saying, ""you don't need a license to drive a sandwich."" While some of the characters, like Sandy and Gary, receive only cameos, the new characters are just as, if not more, entertaining. King Neptune and Mindy were great additions, as were Dennis and David Hasselhoff. All in all, every character is great!
The plot of the movie is very creative, as is the environments. So many memorable locations: The Krusty Krab 2, Thug Tug, The Trench, Shell City and Goofy Goobers to name some of them. The plot of Spongebob and Patrick traveling to Shell City to return Neptune's stolen crown was so much fun to watch. Not to mention, this was the first time (not including the episode Pressure) that we got to see Spongebob and Patrick on the surface, interacting with the real world.
The animation in the movie is top notch. While hand-drawn animation might not look as realistic as 3-D animation, I have always appreciated still seeing hand-drawn animated films. The expressions with the characters are great, as are all the character designs.
In conclusion, The Spongebob Squarepants Movie is an absolutely amazing animated film that will surely not be forgotten. The characters are great and memorable, the plot is fun, the animation is great, and all the comedy jokes hit! I would highly recommend seeing this movie if you have not. The Spongebob Squarepants Movie absolutely gets a 10/10!!!""Despite the old look of film and effects, this film truly defined the feel and atmosphere of what scifi-horror film should do and how. There is darkness, suspense, distrust and disgust.
Characters are easy to define and categorize as they are not the main point and keeping watcher too long occupied introducing them only wastes time. The monster is primary target of all attention, almost as much as is the distrust among the crew. Also the hard and unforgiving environment is present as much that it needs to be recognized as a major factor, impeding travel and posing real threat.
All in all, i think it's shame if someone hasn't seen this great movie. Because it's basis for so much in the scifi-horror scene and it shows that a movie does not need to have multi-million, hi-tech effects so that the movie fills the viewer with dread. Yes, there are few hickups and facepalms but realistically, there are no movies without them.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** An American Werewolf in London is one of those movies from the 80's that often gets overlooked in present day. Directed by John Landis fresh off of Animal House, the film stars David Naughton, Jenny Agutter, Griffin Dunne and John Woodvine as a cast that do well in this comedy/horror movie. Essentially the plot revolves around two US backpackers traveling in England, then they get attacked by a werewolf that kills one of them and turns the other into another werewolf. From the get go, the viewer knows exactly what they're in for from Landis. The music is perfect for the tone of the film even If the 'Bad Moon Rising' scene is a little cheesy but other than that all of the music blends perfectly. As well as that, An American Werewolf in London was one of those rare movies that didn't disrespect the British. And to be honest, even when you look at the film as a horror movie It still stands strong. The scene where David and Jack get attacked by the senior werewolf is dark and intense in all the right ways. Oh and the scene where David gets his first kills in is pretty iconic to say the least. And It's not so much 'scary' but the scene in the porn theater with the corpses is pretty unique as far as monster movies go. In fact to be honest, An American Werewolf in London is exactly unique in every way. It's so rare to see a movie that blends two major genres together in such a way that makes It work, but John Landis managed to do it perfectly. An American Werewolf in London is a perfectly iconic 80's movie that I can watch again and again.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I started to watch this movie purely based on the title. As a fan of Alan Parsons Project, it was the title that triggered me. I didn't read the story-line at all.
Though the story seems to get going a bit slow and rough - were you just try to figure out who is who, where is where and what is happening when - it grabs your attention as soon as the plot becomes clear. And it never let's go. You feel like you get to know all the people, you get to understand them, you start to like them. You cry when they cry... and why.
This movie pulls you into the real, nasty and extreme decisions that sometimes have to be made. It show's how only a few people dare take that necessary but devilish decision to kill some, in order to save lots of people.
I'm not a big fan of the military. Never was, never will. I'll never understand the need for some to overpower others, especially if they don't mind taking lives for it. In a perfect world, there should be no need for any kind of armed group. Police nor defense.
But still... here we are. In an imperfect world, in which we, mankind, created the need for armies. And in this world there are man and woman that try to do whatever they can. Counting the costs, counting lives... balancing costs against lives...
Eye in the sky showed me that those are not easily made decisions. And even though it might seem that they cause unnecessary death, they also prevent a lot of losses.
I'm still not a fan of the military. But I sure do acknowledge the bravery of those who dare take that responsibility.
I think this movie is brilliant because it shows the right and the wrong, especially in the person of colonel Powell (Helen Mirren). Impressive - very impressive.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After watching the movie many times i can assure you that it is very offensive and at first pretty stupid. But similar to Family Guy, Ted is an ingenious work of art. With great satire and acting you manage to feel sad when Ted is ripped in half and almost killed. Ted is like a family guy movie, with similar humor and actors. While many criticize Ted for its plain dumbness and offensive humor, i believe that those factors contribute to the story of. We live in a society of political correctness where nothing can be offensive. All of Seth McFarlane's work, including Ted. pushes those limits making it a movie that is extremely hilarious and won't leave you feeling disappointed when you are done watching.""First, I feel the need to verbalize that the flashback sequence in this film that illustrates Anne Baxter's testimony is incredibly haunting and one of the most memorable little bits of cinema, in my biased eyes. At first sight, I was in love.
In fact, much of the film has the same understated and tragic tone. It is not an outwardly suspenseful film, as many have noted. It relies on expressive lighting (that seems to borrow from European films of the time), solid performances by Baxter and Malden, and a romantic, emotional core. Clift as the center of the film can be a bit underwhelming at times, but his work is believable and never distracting.
Just because this film deviates from what is stereo-typically Hitchcock does not mean it should continue to be overlooked. It was a bit of a flop at the time of its release, and had plenty of strife connected to both the director and lead, but to me, that hardly shows. Its an unusual, visceral gem of a film that deserves a second look.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** What an incredible film.
Chariots of Fire tells the true story of two British Olympians who strove for gold in the 1924 Paris Olympics. The two, however, begin as rivals and each of their ambitions act as counterpoint to the other. Eric Lidell (Ian Charleson) is a devout Christian missionary but so naturally gifted as a runner and driven by his belief in God he is able to succeed. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) runs because he has something to prove; as a Jewish man in England in the 1920s, he is an outcast. He runs out of a sense of indignation and to prove his worth to others and to himself.
This is where the film becomes exceptional. It focuses on the characters. The races are not seen as events of celebration and are not focused on by the director Hugh Hudson. Running is shown in the runners' perspectives; gritty and real, a struggle and a journey. Their focus is shown in the quiet, muted background noise, and the firm thuds of their feet as they run. Their self-fulfilment is evoked by Vangelis' soundtrack, which truly deserves all the praise it is given.
Cross acts very well as a confused, brooding but determined young man. We feel his anger at loss, sympathise with his situation and are inspired by his hard work. Charleson plays the quintessential honourable Christian, a trope made interesting by the conflict the character has reconciling his faith and his running.
It's very easy to say this film is dated and represents bygone British patriotism and class distinction unpalatable with today's norms. But films like this find their relevance in the examination of human nature and everything else in the film is merely the stage for these ideas to be realised.
Chariots of Fire hearkens back to the idea of being able to succeed no matter your background, beliefs or challenges.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Where do i start. this is another great horror movie by one of the best horror directors out there at the moment. From the great acting, story and atmosphere was just chilling and the suspense builds slowly and never feels rushed. I enjoyed saw back in 2004 as well as insidious James wan never fails to disappoint.
Its inspired by true events which makes it more relatable. Even the introduction of Annabelle at the beginning had me hooked from the start and it has already lead to a spin off movie.
The only reason is not a perfect score is for the ending which i found very generic and little disappointed.
All in all a must see for any horror fan or movie fan as a whole.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is not an 8/10 film, but it's not 7/10 either. I'd give it 7.6 and rounding up to the nearest whole number.
Great casting and acting. The acting could've been a little better, but I think the point was to make this film more light-hearted and less of a deep drama. I'm conflicted about that choice.
The film has a good amount of a relationship drama, the friendship between the two entrepreneurs, a cross-border smuggling action scene, enough jokes to cut the tension, which made this film more mainstream and easier to watch for most people.
Perhaps a gritty, dark film about weapons and war would've been too intense for many and would've polarized people into loving or hating this film, rather than having most people liking it.
My wine-like ""goes with"" recommendation: I recommend the show The Night Manager to go with this film.""It's hard to find movies that small children and adults can enjoy but this is one worth watching. There are so many great actors in this movie. I love that it doubles as a family movie as well as a comedy with humorous scenes that adults will enjoy as well.
I love Peter Dinklage's character. He is very convincing as an evil genius and honestly extremely fun to watch. My son requests to watch this movie at least three times a week (he's 3 almost 4). Since I have to watch it so often I'm glad it is something that can entertain me each time I see it! This is a fun movie and it is extremely fun to Quote: / imitate.""Lets be frank. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took something dusty and old, and tried to turn it into something shiny and new, you could retire.
In fact, most of these attempts barely work. But (having seen this one front to back three times since its first release) I believe this is an exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film (hence the low rating) without even giving it a chance.
The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witty and clever and engaging. And wonderfully demented. The cast is to die for. Eva Green and Johnny Depp are at the peak of their craft, delivering with a straight face bits of dialog that lesser actors would choke on. The supporting cast (almost all A-list with a young Chloë Grace Moretz) is rock solid.
Overall a delightfully deranged yet still entertaining exercise in being silly -- which is exactly what Hollywood aims for in these odd exercises.
The IMDb rating is much too low. Give it another chance.""This is one of the darkest, yet most brilliant films I've ever seen. The character of Lester is so beautifully done, building his relationship with the people around him, you have to hand it to Sam Mendes. This is his masterpiece, the spiritual equivalent of Sunset Blvd.
Emerging from the vein of infatuation of an older man for a young girl, this film somehow manages to etch the psyche of an entire generation, filled with ennui and looking for the perfect 'American Beauty'. The camera-work, by Conrad Hall, is very intimate, drawing you into the personal spaces of the characters. And it is no surprise that the poster of the film has become iconic. American Beauty is a masterpiece in its purest form.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There are movies which are generally paced than there are movies which are light which appeal to a bigger audience. I found drishyam slow but that's where it appeals to a bigger audience. It is a story of a man who goes to different lengths to save his family. He does this all by the knowledge he has gained from cinema.
Direction: Average direction.
Screenplay: Above average screenplay.
Cinematography: Average cinematography.
Tone: When it comes to tone, what comes mostly to one's mind are ajays efforts to embed into minds fake incidences occurred on 2nd and 3rd October. Those and other are set well.
Music: Below average.
Acting: Almost everyone associated with the movie has acted really well."I really enjoyed the first one so I was a bit reluctant after reading some of the negative reviews on this site I think the characters in the first one were a bit more likable other than that this one was every bit as good I can only assume that the negative reviews people who are nothing short of ignorant If you saw the first one you def need to see this one You wont be disappointed I've heard rumors of a 3rd one so hopefully that happens The only thing that I was disappointed at (and it's minor)was that Lorraine had to come up with a name (I wont say name of what or its a spoiler) and I've heard that name quite a few other times in different movies All in all though a fine movie and am glad I finally had a chance to watch it"*** This review may contain spoilers *** Finding Dory is basically the same as Nemo but it's Dory's turn now. The story line is quite good actually and the characters are very funny and characteristic. If i am being honest, it's not as good as the first one as it's not as interesting and good as the first one. Firstly the comedy was a bit too much but the first one was more emotional than comical. My sister enjoyed it but she's only eight. I, however am 13 and I like good animation like Toy Story 3 and Frozen and The Jungle Book. But this wasn't as good as those past Pixar films. So I was a little disappointed.
But as I carried on watching, I realised that the film wasn't that bad and actually had quite good voice overs and a good enough story line. All I will say is don't get too hyped or you'll be a little disappointed. It's a good film but a little bad compared the Pixar's last films like Toy Story 3 and Frozen and Wreck it Ralph.""This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.
You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my college days.
The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to take away from this film.
Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then applauded at the end credits as well. I don't recall the last time I heard that at a film. And most importantly - I did not see a cell phone light up the whole time - truly a miracle.""Durr Plant, Blah blah blah, Durr Plant, Mars Bars, Damn Daniel, more Mars Bars, LeafyIsHere, why am I still typing this. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRbOPaGDB_xOQkVM8Rnn62Q Filler text You wouldn't understand unless you fully watch the channel above, don't let your kids watch it or something.

This time, it's not the Pink Panther diamond. He on a murder case in a mansion. People have been going in and out of rooms there. Then suddenly, shots ring out, and everyone is a suspect. The main suspect is the chauffeur's lover (Elke Sommer)who had an affair with the decedent. Clouseau's boss (Herbert Lom) has taken him off the case so many times, that he gets him reinstated again. Despite being inept, Clouseau seems to be persistent on finding out more about the crime. Then there's the scene where Clouseau goes to a nudist colony to find a dead body, and a hilarious scene where he and the maid get out only to be arrested in the city for indecent exposure. Back in the mansion, everyone is a suspect. No one is innocent of indiscretion. But none of them is the killer. The victim is Clouseau. The killer, his own boss, Dreyfuss! That's sad that your own boss wants to get rid of your, seriously! Funny is the to describe it. Instead of finding a jewel thief, it's a mystery of finding out who done it. Everything is good in this film. 5 stars""What Women Want (2000)
For the first time in a career Gibson released 4 movies in a single year, but there was no danger of audiences getting sick of him as What Women Want went on to be his biggest domestic hit to date.
Plot In A Paragraph: After an accident, a chauvinistic ad executive (Gibson) gains the ability to hear what women are thinking.
It's interesting to hear a Gibson called ""The least politically correct guy in the universe"" and personally, I think Gibson was a little bit too old for the role, but his charisma carries it along nicely. And the movie has a great soundtrack.
As for the rest of the cast, Helen Hunt has never looked better, Alan Alda is always fun to watch, as is Marisa Tomei, and it's always nice to see Valerie Perrine in a movie.
One can only wonder what would have happened with Gibson's career, if he paid attention to what was said in this movie
What Women Want ended 2000 the 5th highest grossing movie of the year, with a domestic haul of $182 million. Which was a record high gross for Gibson, although not a personal best in terms of ranking, as Lethal Weapon 2 finished 3rd in 1989. But it was a sure sign Gibson hadn't lost none of his appeal with women audiences.""I loved the original, and found this ""remake"" very good. In the original we had the singing of Helen Redding. In this we had the presence of Bryce Dallas Howard. The story line is I think even better than the original, with more background on Pete and his story.
I have read some of the other comments and find them very lacking in any knowledge of the original. No, the story line is different, but it is PURE Disney. Walt would love this.
Elliott is different, but I noted that many of his facially expressions reminded me so much of the 1977 Elliott. I can remember the original very well, since when I first saw it I was not a child, but only a child at heart.
Well worth watching, if only for the enjoyment.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Damned United (2009) is a biopic about Brian Clough, a former British football player and manager. Directed by Tom Hooper, the film is centred around Clough's infamously unsuccessful managerial spell at Leeds United. The way in which the main character's rise and fall in the football word are portrayed as interwoven with both his partner Peter Taylor  portrayed by Timothy Spall  and his antagonist Don Revie  played by Colm Meany who bears an uncanny resemblance to the real-life figure  is typical for Peter Morgan's screenplays. The eccentric Clough, who seeks to revolutionise Leeds United after Revie's time as manager ended, is superbly captured by Michael Sheen, who is undoubtedly well versed in bringing Morgan's intricate scripts to life. They already worked together on The Deal (2003), The Queen (2006), Frost/Nixon (2008) and subsequently on The Special Relationship (2010). Tom Hooper manages to conjure up the atmosphere of the football world, in which team spirit is an imperative for success, by creating strong references to family unity. Clough's partner Peter Tayler is a gifted talent scout and keeps his lofty colleague grounded, whilst exhibiting an often comical level of intimacy within their symbiotic relationship. Revie on the other hand, takes the place of an admired, yet unattainable father figure in Clough's life. Scenes in which Clough meticulously prepares the run-down Derby County stadium for an FA Cup tie with the then overpowering Leeds United, managed by Revie, establish Clough's basic wish of being respected and admired as a manager. The brutal defeat of his team and the apparently snobbish behaviour of Revie serve as a turning point in Clough's life. Hooper skilfully juxtaposes Clough's heyday at Derby, characterised by chanting fans and bright background lighting lending the manager a saint-like aura, with his bleak days at Leeds, culminating in austerely lit scenes of total isolation. Although the film is deeply rooted in the 1960s and 70s, topics such as outrageous wages and enormous egos are still very relevant to modern football fans. This biopic pays tribute to the legendary partnership of Clough and Taylor, whilst telling a cautionary tale about the detrimental effect of lacking solidarity and humbleness in the sporting world. All in all, an amazing cast performance, an engaging screenplay  albeit not strictly biographical  and riveting editing, interlaced with flashbacks and montages, guarantee an enjoyable viewing experience for everyone who likes to look behind the scenes of sports management.""Enemy really marks out Denis Villeneuve as a director of note. Not as hyped or as ""audience-friendly"" as Prisoners, it saw a limited release, but I've watched it countless times as you get something new from each viewing.
I'm not for spoilers, accidental or otherwise, so I wont say too much other than Villeneuve takes an unoriginal idea that's been done many times in cinema, and manages to make it completely original and interesting.
If you like slightly off kilter, surreal films, then I highly recommend. Its not for you if you like mindless popcorn flicks or you're in the mood for that""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""Unbroken"" is based on the excellent award-winning inspirational book (2010) by Laura Hillebrand, who has an eye for detail and description. It is a biography of the exciting life of Louis Silvie Zamperini of Torrance, California. This review includes several details that were omitted in the movie, included to clarify certain situations.
Louis Zamperini (C.J. Valleroy as young Louie, Jack O'Connell in the title role) was restless and incorrigible as a Californian youth. Bullied, he was a juvenile delinquent. His older brother Pete (John D'Leo, Alex Russell), however, began to take more interest in him and became his mentor when Louie decided to run track. Pete rode his bike as Louie ran alongside him; later he ran far ahead. By high school Louie was setting state and national records: ""The Torrance Tornado"" became the fastest high school runner in US history. At age 19 he was already in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games even though his body was still too young (undeveloped) to win a medal. Nevertheless he surprised even Hitler when he ran the fastest last lap of the 5,000-meter race in 56 seconds. Although robbed of his chance to break a world track record and run an under four-minute mile at the now-canceled 1940 Olympics, Louie continues to train in the vain hope that war will end by 1944, the next scheduled games.
At film's beginning Louie is a flight lieutenant, a World War II bombardier on a B-24 Liberator that has just completed a successful raid on the Japanese-held island of Nauru in the south Pacific (1943). Although the airplane is shot up and crew members are wounded, the crew limps back successfully to base at Funafuti (now Tuvalu). The next mission involves rescuing a downed B-24 crew near the island of Palmyra. But Louie's crew is given ""The Green Hornet,"" an airplane that was not really fly-worthy. Sure enough an engine fails at an inopportune time and the plane has to be ditched over the vast Pacific Ocean (27 May 1943). There was no bail out because of the notorious shark-infested waters. Three of eleven crew members survive (Louie, Phil, Mac); they occupy two rubber rafts lashed together. One of them, friend Allen ""Phil"" Phillip (Domhnall Gleason) has a head wound. The scenes involving the albatross and sharks are as described in the book. Sharks constantly ran their bodies and fins along the raft bottom; the men could feel them (Yikes!). The book describes how more than one of the smaller sharks actually leaped onto the raft; a timely oar saved Louie's head. Then a twenty-foot long Great White slammed against the raft bottom, sending three men into the air. Luckily they landed atop the raft. Francis McNamara (""Mac,"" Finn Wittrock) eats all of the rationed chocolate, the only food. Eventually catatonic, he expires. In violation of the Geneva Convention, a Japanese Zero strafes them. After a record 47 harrowing days of thirst and starvation at sea on rubber rafts, the two survivors receive both good and bad news: they are rescued by the enemy.
After interrogation at notorious Kwajalein, where prisoners were previously executed, Louie and Phil are eventually sent first to Ofuna Prisoner of War (POW) camp, then Omori in Tokyo Bay. Right away Louie is targeted by sadistic Japanese Corporal Watanabe (""The Bird,"" Takamasa Ishiara), who constantly beats him unmercifully. Although the Geneva Convention excludes officers from work details, many are forced into labor. Not working meant that one-half of the already meager rations were cut. Getting enough food to avoid starvation was problematic because of pilferage. Foods allocated for prisoners were stolen by both Japanese military and civilians and sold on the black market. Although Red Cross relief packages had been sent to the POWs, they too were confiscated. To avoid starvation, POWs had to do their own pilfering! (At war's end 1500 unopened Red Cross boxes were discovered locked in a prison storehouse!) The book further describes how Louie and other men were used as test subjects for experiments in biological / chemical warfare. Cloudy liquid forcibly injected into arms caused dizziness and nausea.
Serendipity strikes Louie when Japanese intelligence discovers that American military has mistakenly assumed his death. Knowing that the capture of an American Olympic athlete has propaganda value, the Japanese allow Louie to radio broadcast a harmless message that he is alive and well. After that Louie gets a nice meal in a Japanese cafeteria. But Louie is soon approached by high level Japanese civilians, who want him to disparage America over airwaves. As Louie cannot act in good conscience, it is back to POW camp with Watanabe. Towards war's end, Louie is transferred to the grimy coal barges on Japan's west coast (Naeotsu). War's end and homecoming cannot come soon enough (1945). The instincts that helped Louie endure his mutinous youth had helped keep him alive in despairing situations. Although his post-traumatic stress disorder and religious conversion were skipped, closing captions briefly explain that Louie married and later returned to Japan to forgive his captors for their cruel treatment. The exception was Watanabe, the Bird; he was assumed dead. Not until 1997 did Louie discover that Watanabe was still alive; he died in 2003. The ending shows the real life footage of Zamperini as an old man running the torch for the Winter Olympics (1998), not far from his old POW camp. Louie lived until 2014, dying just a few months before picture release.
Although the movie doesn't cover Louie's post-war years, it is still entertaining. It was nominated for three Academy Awards and won several others. One should not expect the picture to be as detailed as the book. Perhaps the feature could have been extended by, say, thirty minutes; Angelina Jolie directed. The screenplay is decent enough and Roger Deakins' cinematography is excellent. Jack O'Connell plays the tough Italian wonderfully and is inspiring as a man constantly beaten down but who mentally defeats his enemies.""I was first introduced to dragons in school but they were the medieval type and then later as a teen to Asian variety For this little child what a life, his world turned upside down, literally and then later logging brought him to civilization. What a delightful film and Elliott so protective e.g. that scene at the crossing when Pete runs to him and Elliott takes him in his paws in such a protective way. It was an authentic mill scene too..I grew up around mills, logging (mom's side) and as I watched the film where they were at the mill I could almost smell it I have always thought there be unseen things in the forests of the Pacific NW besides Big Foot >;-)""I had heard loosely of Sonderkommandos before watching László Nemes's ""Saul fia"" (""Son of Saul"" in English), but the movie takes an unusual approach to it. This is one of the only movies that I've seen in which almost all the focus is literally on one person, with the background blurred. This serves to emphasize the desperation of the protagonist, a Sonderkommando in 1944 Auschwitz, who wishes to give his son a proper burial. Indeed, we see murdered bodies, as well as the atrocities getting committed by the Nazis, but Saul himself is essentially the window into this horrible setting.
It's an outstanding movie in every way. While much of the movie may seem slow, it's like this so that the characters can develop. It grows especially intense during the final fifteen to twenty minutes. But the truth is that the whole movie is excellent. It deserved the awards that it won.
Another Hungarian movie dealing with the experience of the Jews during this period is 1983's ""Jób lázadása"" (""The Revolt of Job"" in English), about a Hungarian boy adopted by a Jewish couple.""So i just had to do a review for this when i saw there were only bad reviews. This movie is great! It's one of my favourite action movies from the 90's. And as for sequels i think it did a good job. It is a bit different but it is after all set on a cruise ship and has a different male lead.
I find it thoroughly entertaining each time i watch it which is every couple of years. It's the kind of movie you can switch off for a couple of hours and just be entertained. And the villain is great! He is absolutely crazy and i love it when they are so irrational.
So if you like fun movies that don't take themselves too seriously give this a go, i promise it's not as bad as all the other reviewers make it out to be! I give it an 8/10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I almost missed this movie forever because of the bad reviews, I postponed it and thought maybe I wouldn't see it, but it came into my hands and I thought to give it 20 minutes and judge if it was worth it, or if I would leave it halfway as it happened with Mama Mía.
Then I found out it was delivering exactly what I could expect from it, and well done also. Who can ask for anything more these days?
I see all the really bad ratings were expecting something different. Either is too Sondheim for them, or too Disney. Well, it is a Sondheim musical adapted for Disney. They didn't hide any of that, did they? it's a compromised job,short of in between of nowhere, but that's what they sold. I mean, you know what McDonald's is, if you want a great prime rib meat you wouldn't go there, and if you despise meat you wouldn't either. But if you know what you are looking for and it's what they sell, it's perfectly all right to go.
I knew it couldn't be really true to Sondheim, because Disney wouldn't have produced it, and probably not any big budget studio. So I expected a lot of losses. I would have paid for a truer version, but millions wouldn't. So it couldn't be made in this world.
I knew it wasn't a family movie, because why bother adapting this play into a family movie? it would be like trying to adapt the novel 1984 into a family movie.
So it could only be what it is. And being that, I think it's a bold effort and a passionate work from the director and the actors, I hope they were prepared for the insulting reviews and the disappointment of the public, because I think they don't deserve it, but they would know it could happen. I feel grateful that they did this movie, It left me wanting to watch the play which I think it's a great thing, doing some homage to an original work and carrying people to the original.
The first act is really enjoyable, I was thrilled to see it was done with flawless performances and real emotions. It is true that the second act loses interest. But even so, they made a great job considering they had to cut most of the play's strongest ""punches"". For me, the music was perfectly performed and produced, it really gave me the multiple emotions that a Sondheim musical delivers.
It is also true that since I was expecting the worst movie ever, it easily surpassed my expectations. Some great movies you love them without knowing anything in advance, this isn't one of those movies.
Please, keep doing these movies, keep taking risks and bring us works that many of us won't understand. There are already too many works that won't make anyone uncomfortable.
And if you know a couple of Sondheim pays, and you enjoy them, but you understand the compromises cinema has to make to please producers (and sell). Watch this, it's worth it.
I give it a 9, because I'm so offended it has a 6 (It may be an 8 movie).""To make a movie about ""Lolita"" in the early '60s was a difficult task, considering how the censorship and society of the time could've taken some of the most controversial scenes of a story where a literature professor falls in love (spiritually and physically) with a barely teenager girl. Kubrick's choice, alongside Nabokov's screenplay he heavily changed, is a winner: very little of the sexual relationship between Lolita and the professor is shown on camera, but the smaller and bigger hints say more than an explicit scene. The adult is completely subdued by the pure beauty and cocky behavior of his nymphet who feeds him like a dog (at the beginning), has him paint her toe-nails (in the second part and during the titles) and basically manages to have anything she wants out of him, only to discard him later without a word. Humbert himself is a very damaged man, whose obsession leads him to sudden impulses of violence even against his beloved, when caught by a jealousy attack for some teenage boy. The absurdity of Humbert's scoldings to a girl whose interest for boys her age is only natural and whose intercourses with Humbert are not is a device used by the director in other works, namely ""Paths of Glory"" (in regard to war) and ""Dr. Strangelove"" (same).
Kubrick's direction is pretty classic in this film, although some sparse scenes give a twist to the plain drama style: some comedy can be identified in the cot scene (which is hilariously similar to the classic silent films gags) and in the character of Clare Quilty, while aspects of noir/thriller are Charlotte's sudden death, the car following the protagonists and the opening/final scene.
In ""Lolita"" I saw some of the best acting in Kubrick's films, starting with the stellar performance by the lead James Mason, who was perfectly cast for the role and is able to convey very well Humbert's social discomfort and obsession, all the way to pure madness in the hospital scene. It's impossible not to talk about Sue Lyon's Lolita: the actress was 16 at the time and yet she was capable of pulling off one of the most iconic characters in XX century literature. She is and acts extremely hot, with total control of the situation when relating with her slave/lover and at no time does it seem that she feels embarrassed. A truly incredible talent. While I loved beyond reason Peter Seller's performance(s) in ""Dr. Strangelove"", here I didn't always find him fitting with the overall atmosphere: his frantic acting can grow tiring after the first couple of scenes he's in and I frankly don't know if the character himself is a real addiction to the story or just a nuisance.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I seriously loved this film, I have been looking for a film like this for so long and I could not be happier with the way it turned out even with the high expectations I had for it. This film is a beauty to look at, all the shots are done masterfully, the acting is incredible as Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano work really well in this film (Daniel Radcliffe made me speechless, how in the world did he manage to do that for so long, he was very good in this movie).
And I appreciate how much effort it must have taken for Paul Dano to carry that body around on set.
This film is very heartwarming in a lot of ways and there is so much room for detailed analyses of this film because there is just so much there, it is a handful of a film and I really cannot put into words how this film has affected me as a film lover and as a person.
The directors of this film referred to as Daniels did an astonishingly good job with this story and these characters, they brought them to life :) in a way I never expected, it really is a gem in cinema history for me. Films like this should be appreciated a lot more, all the themes and elements in this film make it even more of a thrill and entertaining time for the audience. The cinematography is beautiful, I repeat BEAUTIFUL. I could not believe that this was Daniels first feature length film and It is just shocking due to the perfect shots in this film, all through the film it never disappoints.
It works so smoothly and it is portrayed so well and the story is just a masterpiece to say the least. The shots are lengthy at times but in this case that is not distracting nor irritating but rather the opposite as they have a large effect on the story and the pacing of this film. It is to be taken slowly at times but other times to be experienced at a fast pace.
This movie has a spectacular vision, I am unsure as to how ideas like this just come together and come together so well. I am definitely going to watch this film over and over because of how much there is to experience. The soundtrack is beyond words, this film could be a musical because of how well the music is woven into the story and I can definitely see it being classified as one. The events we are being shown are actually connected to the song being sung at that moment and It is very charming and the music is really well made also (good enough to win an Oscar).
This film talks about a lot of things and at first glance this film may seem like a comedy which it is but it is so much more than that. This movie is incredibly underrated and I would definitely say this is my favorite film of 2016 and the only film that could possibly top it is Blue Jay but again those are two separate films and to me this film is like no other. If you are looking for a film that is different and daring, challenges and changes your expectations of filmmaking and story progression as well as makes you think about reality and what it means to be human whilst having a good time and laughing at some jokes here and there, then this film is perfect for you.
I do believe that this film is one of the best films I have ever seen, I love it.""A charming movie that deserves better reviews. Enjoyed watching and so did my younger brother. Fit the game very well, and the movie keeps your interest at all times. Don't see anything wrong with it! Deserves much more appreciation. Made a successful game into a captivating story. The plot makes sense even if you don't play the game, the whole story line is logical without random scenes. A movie to watch that leaves you feelings cheerful and hopeful. Endearing characters, mediocre music is the smallest complaint I have. Overall impressed. Watch with an open mind and give the movie some well deserved credit! Also gotta love Josh Gad.""If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. 2004's Hellboy was mostly a dull, plodding movie. Every once and a while there were flashes of potential from the creative team: a crackling one-liner, an iconic image, a piece of hard-hitting action, a great character moment. But on the whole, the whole thing felt watered-down, forced, and a waste of talent. Rumor has it that studio suits interfered, as they're wont to do, with the creative vision of the director. But that director was Guillermo Del Toro, whose next film, the visionary Pan's Labrynth, won three Academy Awards, received a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, and got a whopping 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This time, the studio suits politely stood out of his way.
Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is at once an altogether superior sequel as well as a highly entertaining standalone adventure movie. The characters are terrific, the action sequences genuinely thrilling, the comedy hits the mark (it rarely did in the first film), and the visual design is at times among the most original and unique of anything I've ever seen. Go see this movie to enjoy the craft of a great director on the rise. You don't have to have seen the first film to enjoy this one.
For me, this is on par with Iron Man as the summer's best action entertainment so far (The Dark Knight, of course, soon cometh). While no character in this shines as brightly as Robert Downey Jr's ultra-cool Tony Stark, the ensemble here is better, the action is just as good, and the creativity and visual imagery are terrific. When I saw the first Hellboy I didn't care if the series continued; having seen it's brawny, spunky, and imaginative sequel, I cannot wait for another installment. **** (out of five) Rated PG-13 for creepy images, action violence.""Face/Off, a master piece of the 90's, is a must watch film. This sweeping drama stars two paragons of Hollywood, Oscar Winner, Nicolas Cage, and John Travolta, of Michael fame. Nicolas Cage knows no bounds when playing a cheeky, but unsettling, Castor Troy, yet is able to capture family man Sean Archer with a profound execution. Not to be outdone, John Travolta's daring portrayal of Caster brings out this family man's inner demons. When one hoodwinks the other, the game is afoot. All in all, Cage and Travolta deliver a performance that dances into our souls that would make Curious George and The Man With The Yellow Hat proud. However, John Travolta's actual dancing is sorely missed from this film. Despite this sole flaw, this IS a must watch.""Not a horror film, but an excellent film.
A debate between science and religion In my opinion, this film is one of the great ones. Of course that depends on your philosophy and beliefs. I am an agnostic, meaning I am not at all affiliated with any religions but I like to keep an open mind about the those phenomena that are still unexplained to humans.
I am also a fan of science and well-read in psychiatry and clinical psychology. While definitely not a fan of any man-created religion, I do keep an open mind about what could be on the other side.
As a horror film fan, I had been waiting to watch this film. I admire Shohreh Aghdashloo (although she was given a small role here) and didn't know Jennifer Carpenter at the time. I was at first disappointed because I was expecting typical horror entertainment. However I realized that although there are a few creepy scenes, these are mostly realities that many schizophrenics have to deal with often. Many of them live this in their crises when they hallucinate, become delusional, etc. It's such a patient who is the most scared, not those who observe her. The film shows us how scary it is for her.
Now the question remains, whether this is a mental illness or has roots in ""Evil"", as defined by the Christian tradition. During the entire time the viewer is searching for this answer, and at the it remains open-ended, thus giving much credit to science and psychiatry (explaining that in this modern age there should be medical intervention) but at the same time leaving the door open for the paranormal.
I admired Jennifer Carpenter after this film. She usually does not play the role of the typical Hollywood glam girl who are dime a dozen. This girl can act. If you have seen the Dexter series, you will know what I mean. All the actors are great. All in all, a very deep film and has you wondering after it has ended, if at all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** RoboCop was one of those movies that I wasn't allowed to watch as a child but ended up getting out of my Dad's bedroom when he was at work to watch. And I've never regretted that act of childhood disobedience. The film stars Peter Weller as the leading man/machine/cop and he takes It as the role of a life time. After being nearly killed by a group of criminals lead by Kurtwood Smith's Clarence Bodikker with Ronny Cox's Dick Jones playing Emperor Palpatine to Smith's Darth Vader, he then becomes RoboCop who eventually sets about avenging his own murder. What we then see whilst Murphy kicks ass, killing off criminal after criminal is his journey to finding some humanity again as he ... kills relentlessly. A different stretch of humanity, I'll give you that. But It is superbly cool to see him taking down low life criminals, right up until his most successful death of Bodikker and Dick Jones. What also makes an appearance in RoboCop is ED 209 which is also a bad ass robot, but he's aligned with Dick Jones. And between all of the kick ass action scenes we also get Nancy Allen's Lewis playing Murphy's partner whilst becoming equally bad ass herself. However despite the characters themselves, the highlight of the original RoboCop is definitely the action sequences, a lot of the time It actually feels like you're right there with Murphy as he drives through Detroit dishing out swift justice. To sum RoboCop up I'd have to call It one of my more watched action movies, with a simple but effective collection of elements to go with it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I first fell in love with Jim Carrey through The Mask and It's still my favorite comedy of his. He stars as Stanley Ipkiss a.k.a The Mask and it's perhaps the most iconic of his performances If nothing else in the eyes of the majority of audiences, alongside The Mask stars Cameron Diaz in her feature film debut (if I'm correct) as well as Ben Stein, Amy Yasbeck, Peter Reigert, Peter Greene and Richard Jeni in supporting roles. Essentially the plot revolves around banker Stanley finding the mask of Loki in a river after a particularly bad day, he then finds himself transforming into a green faced public menace that can whirlwind himself to different locations in a blink of an eye. And he's so cool. When I was young and I watched The Mask for the first time I wanted to be The Mask ... so much so, that my sisters made me a wooden mask like the one in the movie. Yup. But yeah The Mask is so iconic and despite what a certain straight to DVD sequel will tell you, Jim Carrey is the only one that could've carried the role off. Also to talk about is how attractive I found Diaz's character Tina Carlyle, fair enough her acting isn't anything worth mentioning and her character is a little bland but her character will always have a place in my heart as one of my first childhood crushes. But despite that and a moderately well done villain from Peter Greene, The Mask remains to this day as one of my favorite Jim Carrey roles and one of my favorite childhood movies.""Spoilers Ahead:
Yes, as many good reviewers have told you, this a cultural satire. Lucky for you, ArchAngel doesn't care about voting totals. It is a very specific 'cultural' satire: the target is the extrapolation of progressive trends from when this movie was made. The film revolves around the feud between violent cop John Spartan and Simon Phoenix, played well by Snipes, who steals the movie. Phoenix sets Spartan up where he, inadvertently, kills some hostages getting himself frozen at the Cryoprison. Phoenix is committed there also, but, mysteriously, he is able to escape and commences, within a 'pacifistic paradise', to murderous mayhem, necessitating the defrosting of John Spartan. The society is totalitarian but it is played for laughs: there is even a cursing monitor: The Verbal Morality statute machine, that spits out tickets for foul language. The essence of the society, and the movie's cultural focus of attack is spoken by Huxley (Notice her name),""Cursing, smoking, alcohol, meat, salt, spicy foods, violence have all been deemed not good for you, hence they are illegal."" The leader of this 'paradise' Cockteau (love that name) has turned all the men into bath-robed eunuchs (another hint) who walk about listening to old radio advertisements like 'I'm An Oscar Meyer Weiner.' Violence is unknown, everything is run by a matriarchal computer (another hint) that instructs the 'calm enhancers' how to deal with problems.
One of the funniest scenes is where these invertebrates surround Phoenix, preparing to arrest him. Snipes responds with acidic contempt, sneering at them. The mommy computer says,""In an ever firmer tone of voice, approach maniac and say, 'lie down on the ground or else.'"" Suffice to say, Phoenix launches several of them into orbit. The movie is best described to you as an action comedy with plenty of satire at the progressives' expense. You will never see former mayor Bloomberg's regulation of soda sizes or saturated fats the same ever again. I actually had a retarded attorney who said,""Be Well, Garth."" I said, did you know that you are quoting Chief Earle from Demolition Man: How is that for prescient? Stallone is good, but in my opinion, Snipes is better; he has the best lines in the movie. I love when he looks at Dr. Cockteau,""I know who you remind me of, an evil Mr. Rogers."" Oh how about when he addresses his defrosted gang,""I'm sorry to tell that that America has been taken over by a bunch of bath-robed sissies."" The movie darkens as we discover that this castrates' paradise has come at the cost of the poor and deviant being pushed underground, starving in the sewer system.
The critical attack focused on Denis Leary, who is a bit shaky as an actor, but his scenes are very few. Spartan discovers the suffering of these people and begins to turn upon his bath-robed masters. My favorite exchange is where Cockteau tells him,""Be Well,"" to which Sly points his 45 and responds,""Be F'd."" Stallone's fish out of water scenes are echoed by Snipes with the museum worker asking Phoenix,""What seems to be your boggle?"" He then uses his body to open the case hurling him through the glass. There is a romance between Bullock and Stallone but it is a small part of the movie. Not remotely for children, with serious violence, strong language and adult themes. It has always been one of my favorite movies, for mixing action with comedy is perilous, as we all found out with McTiernan's Last Action Hero. He did: Die Hard and the 13th Warrior, but it is very difficult to mix the opposing genres well. Here, the movie is funny without devolving into camp like Buckaroo Banzai. I share Spartan's reaction to his supervising officers singing 'Armour hot dogs' with,""Could somebody put me back in the fridge?"" Yes, Sly, I know exactly how you feel. A Unique, Scathing Satire Upon The Nanny State. Excellent. Q.E.D.
""The Individual Has Always Had To Struggle To Keep From Being Overwhelmed By The Tribe. If You Try It, You Will Be Lonely Often And Sometimes Frightened, But, No Price Is Too High To Pay For The Privilege Of Owning Yourself."" Friedrich Nietzsche""If you are looking for a film next weekend, then be sure to see ""Bend it like Beckham"". I've not seen a lot of films in my life but this one is a very special one. ""Bend it like Beckham"", directed by Gurinde Chadha in 2002, deals with culture problems, soccer, friendship and love. The film is set in London. The story is very interesting and engrossing. An Indian family has a soccer-playing daughter, named Jesminder, who wants to play football professionally like her idol Beckham, but she gets many problems. One day Jesminder plays football in the Hounslow Park with her friends. A girl, whose name is Jules, watches her for a few minutes. She is fascinated by Jess' skills. She walks over to the group, introduces herself and invites Jess to a trial at the Hounslow Harrier. This dialogue invites their upcoming friendship. At Jess' first trial she is very nervous. Before she runs over to the coach Joe and Jules, she watches the training for some time. Jess is so fascinated how the girl play football. Joe looks skeptical and asks her which position she usually plays. Then she starts her warm-up and begins to play together with the team. After the training Joe is convinced and Jess gets a chance to play football professionally. A few days later she meets her friends in the park,she comes from her football training. Suddenly Mrs Bhamra, her mother, sees her while she is running around with half-naked boys. Her mom takes her at home. At home Jesminder and her parents have a discussion. Mr and Mrs Bhamra don't want this shame on her family. Jesminder should learn full Punjabi dinner, meat and vegetarian, and she should behave like a proper women. Her parents forbid Jesminder to play football. Also the think that they have enough problems with her sister Pinky, who wants to marry in the next weeks. Jesminder is sad and doesn't know what she could do, because she doesn't want to giver her dream up. Therefore she decides to play football secretly. But later she has to make a choice between football and tradition, because the weeding from her sister is at same day as a important football match. This match offers her the chance to get a scholarship. Will Jess go to the important game or is it the end of her dream to become a star like Beckham. But to find out how the film ends you have to view it yourself. In addition all the cinematic devices used in this film serve a function and achieve their intended effect, for example the situation in the living-room when Jess' parents talk to her. The high-angle shot presents the inferiority of Jess. It shows that Jess is desperate,sad and shy. The medium shot of her allows the viewer to see the situation from the position of the parents. On the other hand you can see that Mr and Mrs Bhamra are superior. The low-angle shot of them presents their fury and their disappointment. The music at the end underlines the bad situation. All this cinematic devices presents the situation from Jessminder's position. This scene is very important for the film, because the culture problems and the problems with her family begin. To sum up it is a very interesting, exited and easy understanding film. If I were ask to rate this film on a Scala from zero to ten, I would give it 8 points.""One of the best game adaptation movie beside Resident evil! I really love the movie. And since i also played the game, i have no complaint about this. Well, although the story is predictable, but it is well executed. And it teaches you that no one knows the human heart. If you are a good person, then you'll be better. If you are bad, then welcome the monster. If you are into an action-horror genre, this is the right movie for you. You will be pleased with the action scene and the martial arts also. And there's a part when it's just like in the game, where the camera took the point of view from the main character, and it's like you who shoot the zombie monster. And it's cool!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In short: The film has quality acting, direction, special effects, and script. That alone makes it unique in the horror genre.
Spoiler ahead....
This is the best zombie film to come out for many years. The plot is original and the story line develops organically. It is a very well written film. The actors do a great job, which makes it worth watching just because that is often rare in a horror film. They also do great in conveying important points and ideas to the audience. The film has a budget, so the gore and special effects are done in a quality manner. This also makes this film worth watching. The director has done a great job in shooting this film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Even though I read my share of Goosebumps books as a kid, I still didn't run out to see Goosebumps. I don't remember the specific characters except the most famous ones (e.g. Slappy the dummy). The other reason is because even though I like Jack Black, his really good movies are few and far between. I checked this out on-demand and I'm honestly happy I did. This movie ended up being a lot better than I thought it would be. It knows how to celebrate the spirit of R.L. Stine's work, there's some surprisingly solid acting from the cast and they put some work into the relationships between the characters that would normally make my eyes roll.
*Minor Spoilers Ahead* It's a beautiful day as Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mom Gale (Amy Ryan) move into their new house in Madison, Delaware. They've decided to try and get a fresh start after a tragedy strikes their family and moving from New York City to a small town seems like just the ticket. Zach is less than thrilled about it and reluctantly carries in boxes from the truck. He's trying to wrap his head around the transition and his kooky Aunt Lorraine (Jillain Bell) when he unexpectedly makes contact with his neighbour Hannah (Odeya Rush). She seems to get him immediately but before their conversation gets too far, her dad Stine (Jack Black) yells at her to get back in the house.
Movies geared towards families often lack the bite to appeal to adults. This isn't news and if you're looking for some dark horror here, my first question is why? Knowing the source material is the key (as is watching any of the material in the marketing). I think the movie hit the right counterbalance between soft-balling it in and pushing the envelope too far. There are some monsters here that would be pretty scary for the younger kids but as an adult, there's nothing frightening here. It's about right for the audience it's intended for, they wring some laughs out of what's supposed to be some of the scarier scenes. The monsters and villains from the Goosebumps novels are pictured on the screen in imaginative ways that are fun to watch, even when they're trying to stab, eat or maim our heroes.
The concept of Stine's books coming to life might seem lame but it reminded me of classic movies that had a lot of imagination. They don't give the audience a concrete explanations on why is this is possible? How could this happen? (it made me think of BIG with Tom Hanks, he grew up all of a sudden because... magic?). But it grew on me as the movie went on. The creative team introduces the concept and then they largely play by their own rules. You never get a chance to ask too many questions because the movie does move along at a decent clip when stuff starts falling apart in Madison, Delaware.
Another area this movie could have fumbled the ball is dealing with the characters. You've got a lot of your cliché plot-lines for a coming-of-age tale: the strained relationship between the parent and their kid, the teenage romance where the new kid in town falls in love with the shut-in etc. But this movie was refreshing in how they decided to deal with those well-worn stories. Instead of the typical ""you don't get me"" stuff, Gale and Zach still have a loving relationship, even though it has it's problems. They joke and deal with their difficulties together and I appreciated that. Another example is how the relationship between R.L. Stine and Slappy is explained. We grow to learn that Slappy is just a shadowy reflection of Stine (authors draw from what they know) and he represents Stine's inability to connect with people and how that's frustrated him even to this day. Not every subplot avoids pitfalls, Zach and Hannah's budding romance has been done over and over again in other movies. But the movie does a good job on not concentrating on it too long and they keep it moving by adding a few jokes or throwing a new twist in to avoid stagnation.
I was also impressed by the cast in Goosebumps. You would think Jack Black would mug his way through this material but he's more nuanced and funny in this than the marketing lets on. He carries certain scenes in this movie easily and it's easy to forget how good he is if he's cast in the right role. Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush were decent as Zach and Hannah. The fact that they were teenage leads falling in love would normally be enough to lose my interest but they worked well together and apart. I thought Ryan Lee was funny but he was really over-doing it in certain bits. Jillian Bell was also solid in her small role, I'm liking her more and more. Amy Ryan also hit the right notes for her character to be effective.
Lastly and maybe most importantly, the movie is pretty funny when it wants to be. The script seems to know when it's okay to wink at the audience. It doesn't hurt that you have guys like Jack Black delivering the dialogue but with all the rapid-fire jokes being fired at you, the hit-miss ratio was notably higher than I expected (minus some pretty awful puns by Slappy).
Goosebumps could have been really awful. It could have been just an attempt to boost the sales of the books and the studio could have just done the bare-minimum to turn a profit. It wasn't though and I can see why it ended up being a minor hit. They put their own spin on some well-travelled concepts and they made a good decision to couple it with some quickly paced humour and some appropriate to the source material horror. Goosebumps turned out to be some decent entertainment after all.""In May 1942, an assassination attempt was carried out against Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Nazi forces in German-occupied Czechoslovakia and a key architect behind the 'Final Solution' against the Jews. The British and the exiled Czech Government had concocted the assassination plan together, choosing Heydrich as a target due to his position within the Nazi hierarchy, his role within Prague and for his abhorrently brutal actions against civilians. Around 6 months before the assassination attempt was made, two soldiers; Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis; parachuted into Czechoslovakia to begin Operation Anthropoid.
This is where Anthropoid begins, as the ever-excellent Cillian Murphy (Jozef) and the impressive Jamie Dornan (Jan) have just touched ground, removed their parachutes and set about finding their bearings. We follow Jozef and Jan as they make their way to Prague, searching cautiously for their contacts within the Czech Resistance, before stationing themselves into position in order to plan the assassination.
Director Sean Ellis delivers a hugely accomplished effort here, in what is essentially a film of two halves. With the assassination attempt sensibly positioned in the middle of the film, the first half is a slow, steady build-up laden with intricate dialogue as we get to know Jozef and Jan and the supporting players within the Resistance. We learn much of their personalities, and significantly, their motivations. Jozef and Jan in particular are not action heroes ready to fearlessly take on the Nazi army; these are two scared, on-edge and paranoid men clinging onto a belief that what they're about to do is necessary and right.
The second half picks up the pace dramatically, as Jozef, Jan and the Resistance deal with the aftermath and the reprisals of their assassination attempt, which ultimately lead to an epic, enthralling, violent and harrowing climax.
It's perfectly pitched by Ellis, who controls the pace with great assurance and uses it to mirror the environment and state-of-mind of the protagonists. Indeed, within moments of the start of the film, we see Jozef and Jan fighting for their lives; panic, anxiety, bewilderment and fear etched on their faces. The pace then slows as they set about establishing their position within the Resistance; determination, authority and motivation all conveyed but always with that undertone of paranoia and fear. The pace of the film could almost represent the heartbeats of Jozef and Jan. However, should anyone feel even remotely bored by the slower elements of Anthropoid, they would be wise to stick with it and reap the reward of being thrown into some unbelievable action once Ellis ramps the pace up.
By developing such a steady and precise build up, and drawing out the anxiety and fear of his leads so well, Ellis expertly allows for tension to softy bubble under the surface, and times it perfectly to create an explosive boiling point at the necessary moment. Every bullet and explosion is felt and heard by you as the audience (making this a worthwhile trip to the cinema!), flying shrapnel and shards of stone and glass sound as if they're inches away from hitting you, and the relentless gunfire and sense of panic really draws you into the scene to the point that you begin to experience the chaos and anxiety yourself... and that was just the assassination attempt. The finale recreates this ten-fold and further plaudits must therefore be given to Ellis for his ability to depict such intense action and play out such well crafted set-pieces against a backdrop of intricate drama and character development.
Naturally, though, praise must be given to the leads and supporting cast for many of the aforementioned points. Murphy and Dornan are absolutely superb in their respective roles, convincingly portraying every emotion one can only imagine someone feeling in such terrifying and uncertain circumstances. They probably had an equal amount of screen time, with most of their scenes together, yet both were able to convey their character's personalities and traits overtly and convincingly, allowing the audience to fully distinguish those motivations and fears between them.
The likes of Toby Jones, Harry Lloyd and Charlotte Le Bon also all did their part, Le Bon especially standing out as a victim of circumstance as a result of the operation.
Of course, this story is merely one subplot of the atrocities of WW2, and interspersed throughout Anthropoid are reminders of these. Needless to say, Heydrich himself is symbolic of the evil of the Nazi regime, yet the question remains given the severity of the repercussions that followed the assassination attempt, whether he was ever even a sensible target. This is therefore astute storytelling and far from a generic WW2 movie in which the good guys beat the bad guys. It asks questions, and highlights perhaps some of the more unfamiliar victims of the Nazi oppression.
As such, this is far from a light hearted, no-brainer action romp. It's deep, dark, disturbing, intense and thought-provoking, and it's superb!

I didn't know what I would expect when I saw the trailer for the first time. Wes Anderson, the director of this movie, has done such a brilliant job creating this masterpiece. Every scene seemed to be perfect and well-thought according to my aspect, Robert Yeoman (cinematographer) is very clever for creating scenes with aesthetically pleasing colors and angles to attract the person watching, the vibe of the movie is what made me most excited to watch it. The plot is fun, exciting, and funny. Not a movie that you'd find yourself yawning half-way. Zero (Tony Revolori) is the new lobby boy that finds himself on an unusual adventure with M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) his manager.""This film is a brilliant portrayal of the hardships of the common bee. It truly is an amazing work of film and I think it defies all knowledge of our existence and our common beliefs as a society, it is hypnotizing and intelligent, a true masterpiece. I LOVE THIS GODDAMN MOVIE, IT IS BRILLIANT! 10/10 - Barry Bee Benson is my hero!. I truly feel this film will become one of the best films in human history, I believe that this film is beautiful and can teach us all a valuable lesson, LOVE ALL BEES!
I love Barry Bee Benson - what a charming character, I find him to be the very best of them all and his story and character is so complex and interesting, I find him to be one of the most important main characters of toady's society, I like this directing also, very new and unique and not at all repetitive and boring, NOOO.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie was actually exceptionally good in my opinion. For what it is supposed to be (action sci-fi horror) it hit every requirement on par.
Amazing special effects and practical effects, great costume, great budget production (amazing scenery) and a decent plot which was well fleshed out with interesting characters. On top of the awesome practical effects, it had good camera angles during the action scenes which give you a good view of the creature which weren't OVERLY SHAKY and don't give you nausea like most modern movies.
I think this movie gets a bad rap just because of a couple stupid decisions by the characters and characters which were frustrating or making stupid decisions. I thought the woman Sam played a horrible role, she kept making the audience feel like she was secretly hiding something with that evil, blank, and cold look on her face. Plus, she wanted to take time to try to heal everybody or do autopsies in the middle of a massive gunfight/evacuation.
Perhaps the reason why this movie got low ratings were the stupid decisions made by the characters (i.e. the main character's decision to FIGHT THE ROCK hand to hand instead of just shoot him with his bullets), or the overly-dramatic scene when the movie turns into a first-person shooter (I LOVED that part and thought it was done very well) even though this appeals highly to anybody who has ever played a first person shooter. This movie held true to gamer's hearts, including things such as the gravity gun (which is shown to us early on but doesn't become available until you unlock it later on in the game, just like in movie) and a bunch of other easter eggs for gamers.
All in all, this movie deserves AT LEAST a 7/10 for its genre and artistic intent. If you watch this expecting for a challenging mystery filled with surprises and plot turns, don't come here as you will be disappointed and will rightly give the movie a 5/10 as it is currently rated. However, go here for the right things and you will not be let down!
Highly underrated movie!""While yes, John Carpenters remake is superior and is one of the finest horror/sci of films of all time, that shouldn't devalue the original which is a tense and thrilling ride. One unique aspect about this film is the dialogue, it overlaps and feels natural making the characters more likable which in turn increases the tension. The movie never has a single slow moment or dull scene as there is constant dread throughout making this film a compelling watch. This movie is also note ale for being one of the first to pioneer the ""less is more"" technique as we never really get a good look at the monster which adds to the tension. Therefor,ancestry are all excellent with the character of Scotty being they standout character who is funny but not in a way that dissolves the tension. Overall I highly recommends this gem, but go in with the mindset that its own film and don't unfairly compare it to the remake as they are so vastly different I actually believe it would be more accurate to call alien (1979) a remake of this film then the Thing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I've been meaning to check out the older Kubrick films - I've only seen the ones from 1962 onwards. The Killing wasn't really what I expected, it didn't have the slow pacing and steady shots that I associate with Kubrick, but it was a good crime movie. It's basically a prototype for heist movies like Ocean's Eleven: a ragtag bunch of crooks come together with each their special part to play in a big gig that will leave all of them rolling in cash. The perfect crime in this case is theft of the safe of a horse racing track.
The movie is largely dialog-driven, it's clever and thrilling and at times funny. The ending is a standout, really well executed and just for that totally worth a watch. The movie hasn't aged at all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In this beautiful film directed by the talented Guillermo Del Toro, he brings imagination and fantasy to life. The film that surrounds the adventures of a young girl named Ofelia, are intertwined with the wrath of her new step father Captain Vidal. His strategical military view is abrasive and firm. Ofelia is tasked by a faun to carry our several types of errands so that she can be with her family from the underworld. Meanwhile Captain Vidal is killing everyone from the doctor to the rabbit hunters. He even killed the rabbit hunters with a beer bottle. That is actually pretty impressive. Vidal's views are Type A personality style. He is stern with his soldiers and has a form of Hitler mentality. The ideology of this film is basically from Captain Vidal wanting a better Spain. And he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. This film is an intense film for anyone to watch. From Vidal killing everyone in his way to his cheek being slashed open. This is a film definitely not for children, but for adults to escape in their inner Ofelia to an adventure far away.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Overall: This movie is just simply excellent. It is one of Pixar's finest and is 100% worth watching
Good: This movie contains absolutely gorgeous animation that is so rich with detail and care it is outstanding. Every frame has so much care and passion implemented into it, it is truly a sensational spectacle to behold. The story is beautifully woven and emotionally charged. Each character was interesting a likable. The villain was conniving and cruel and easily hate-able. His relationship to the hero was also a great choice. Doug is my personal favourite character with all the charm and love and wit you could ever ask for in a dog. Russell is quirky and funny and you just cannot help but adore him. His polar opposite, Mr Frederickson, however, is cold and harsh and even ruthless but you can see the goodness inside him and feel really sorry for him. A magnificent ending which perfectly fits and can make a grown man cry, in typical Pixar fashion. The music is beautiful and is intricately designed and chosen to be perfect for each scene which it is. This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, keep you on the edge of your seat and make you exclaim in amazement. A Pixar Masterpiece.
Bad: I sound like the world's biggest jerk here but I refuse to believe a chubby kid and a frail old man can keep a house, with enough balloons attached to make it fly, on the ground. It's an animation so liberties can be made but this just annoyed me slightly.
Best Part: The beautiful ending.
MVP: Ed Asner/Jeremy Leary as Carl Frederickson
10/10: A Masterpiece""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The beginning scenes shot in India were great and the child actor did a great job with it. Nicole Kidman as the kid's mother did a convincing job. I admire Dev Patel and he played his part really well. It was really convincing and brought me to the edge of my seat. Knowing that it is a true story heightened its impact.
All thanks to Google Earth for getting a family together again.
I was impressed with the story-line and the dialogues were on the spot. I wish more of his life growing up and adjusting to life in Australia were covered, but wouldn't cut any part of the movie for it. His frustrations dealing with his repressed memories looked so real that I couldn't breathe for some moments.
The only peeve I have with the movie is that I wish Rooney Mara had a bigger role.""This movie is a masterpiece with a nice mix of humour and serious.
But what really makes this movie brilliant is the acting Jamie Fox, Samuel L.Jackson and Waltz were all brilliant. But really the man who stole the show was DiCaprio it was so amazing to see him play Calvin Candie a type of role we never had seen him play before and it turned out to be one of his best performances ever. Just his acting makes this movie worth watching.
Especially the scene where screams and cuts his hand, GENIUS! I really hope for some more DiCaprio Tarantino collaborations because this was brilliant even though he only played a supporting role. This was definitely the movie with the best supporting actors I mean Waltz and Samuel L.Jackson and Christoph Waltz are like the masters of supporting roles and then the master of acting DiCaprio.
Brilliant...""I have seen this movie at least a dozen times - likely even more. For me, it is a top 5, and could easily be tied for #1 with the other 4!
The beauty of the film is found in Forrest Gump's innocence and purity and the way he deals with adversities and others, especially being raised in a conservative, white-powered, pre-60s Alabama culture. He does not see color, race, intelligence or gender - partially thanks to the way his mother raised him and painted a simple picture of life analogies for him to understand everything. He somehow manages to retain that innocence through some very difficult times. As he is picked on as a child, as a Vietnam soldier then veteran, as a college graduate of the late Sixties, and as an adult struggling through friendships, love, death, money and life challenges. Anyone watching should be able to personally relate to some of the various periods and parts of Forrest's life.
I would not be doing this review justice if I did not mention the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and detailed costumes that lent itself to making this film epic. It truly is a film that captures your attention and imagination and holds it for its entire length. I recently shared it with my kids, who, even after 20+ years, found it amazing to watch.""This complex yet accessible movie is to be read on many level, many layers. The story of those two guys and they relationship is the starting point of a journey into itself, into the mind and into our perception of the human being and the world. The direction of Fincher is precise and guides the viewer to wherever he wants to be reality or dream! The acting of Pitt and Norton couldn't be more accurate, organic and animal! Each scene is precisely where it should be and how it should be, the complexity within reveal itself after each view of the film. The meanings behind the movie can be interpreted in different manners and different perspectives. This film is full, meaning full and as crazy as the characters""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Going to watch this film I didn't exactly know what to expect, I knew it was a war film but I didn't know just how realistic it would be. The battle scenes are long and gruesome and you have a sense of being thrown right in the middle. Not only that but there is some seriously good story telling and the acting is superb. There is so much emotion put in to this and some scenes are lighter when they need to be and it gives overall a very good balance of pace, action and storytelling. Andrew Garfield is very convincing and Mel Gibson has overall directed one of the all time great war films.
Whatever you go to the cinema for, you wont be disappointed with this.""With all the high expectations I watched Dear Zindagi and here's how it went. Let's put it straight. The movie was going nowhere in the very first hour. It felt like a plot less and boring one. Throughout the film even SRK was a co- actor I felt like that Alia was under-shadowed by him. He was, as always actually brilliant. Alia wasn't so devoted to the character she was playing. She failed to pervade herself into Kaira. But then the twist took place. I cannot remember when I watched a film soothing as this in my recent past. It was so appeasing and will gladden your mind. Eventually Dr.Jug will help you to look through your life again from a different perspective. - ----""DON'T LET THE PAST BLACKMAIL YOUR PRESENT TO RUIN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE!""""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The decision to either abandon one's dream of success in the arts, or to compromise one's own artistic vision and modify a dream to conform to someone else's, is a heartbreaking and emotionally traumatic moment in the life of a performer. And it is during that transitional moment in the lives of two performersan actress and a jazz pianistthat the movie La La Land occurs. How the two reach that decision, how they visualize itand most importantly, whether or not they can survive it together, as a coupleforms the plot of the picture.
And what a picture La La Land turns out to bea 128-minute swirling, colorful explosion of a movie, equally brimming with elation and heartbreak, drama and comedy, but all filled with singing, playing, and dancing not in movies sincewell, maybe ever. Comparisons to 1985's A Chorus Line or 2002's Chicago or even 1933's 42nd Street are inadequate. And to measure the film against 1952's classic Singin' in the Rain, often considered the best musical ever made, is just simply inappropriate.
La La Land stands on its own--it is its own unique, exhilarating self. Even for those of us who don't enjoy musicals, La La Land is an inspiration, because more than about art or music or performance, it's about life itself. You think you've had a bad day? Take a look at these poor unfortunate souls as they realize they might have squandered their entire lives on a dream no more substantial than a Land of Lollipops and Cotton Candy, Somewhere Over a Rainbow.
Just after the movie screen opens up and widens to reveal the picture will be presented in glorious CinemaScope, the widest and largest film presentation available, and in vibrant and breathtaking Technicolor, the very first scene takes place on a steamy day in a traffic jam outside Los Angeles. One single, frustrated driver exits her car and begins to tentatively sing a song about how she's remaining optimistic despite the misery of the day.
That solitary driver is soon joined by another driver, and then another, and another, until moments later the entire freeway is filled with a breathtakingly entertaining musical production piece involving hundreds of drivers, all performing an optimistic song to a driving tempo while displaying spectacular synchronized jumps and whirls and high-steps in a variety of dance styles. It's a tough act to followbut as Al Jolson said in 1927's The Jazz Singer, Hollywood's very first musical, ""You ain't seen nuthin' yet!"" Nominally the stars of La La Land are the vibrant and lovely Emma Stone as Mia, an aspiring actress, and the laconic, handsome Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, a jazz pianist performing for tips in a lunchtime restaurant. Stone and Gosling also teamed effectively earlier in their careers, in supporting roles in the 2011 comedy Crazy, Stupid Love, starring Steve Carell and Julianne Moore.
In La La Land, Stone's Mia is a young actress toiling as a waitress at an upscale coffee shop. Mia accepts the slights, low tips, and casual cruelties of both customers and co-workers with an indefatigable sense of optimism while religiously attending auditions for acting roles, when she can find them. She believes in her dream, and is aggressively pursuing the opportunity that will vindicate her vision and show that all her effort has been worthwhile.
Emma Stone with her luminescent eyes and expressive smile opens her heart, and shares with the audience nuances of every tiny triumph and discouraging failureher feelings quickly become ours, until we're praying for her success almost as much as she is.
Gosling as Sebastian, the jazz pianist, turns in a less effecting performance than Stone, but that might be a subjective pointsome viewers simply don't quite comprehend the actor's performance method: Gosling often appears inarticulate, murmuring his dialogue while looking downward or away from the other character, then looking up to assess the impact of his lines, followed by a wistful smile, as if the actor's recalling a sweet memory from long ago. Gosling is effective in his role as Sebastian, but some of that success is earned as a result of the belief Mia places in himwe trust her trust.
Both Gosling and Stone, however, dazzle in their musical scenestheir singing and dancing are impressive, and at times exhilarating. The canny viewer will notice, however, that often the dancing is presented in very small segments of two of three seconds duration, edited together to create the illusion of one continuous performance. It's a trick of Tom Cross' expert editing, but it works beautifully: Stone and Gosling are not Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, but watching them dancing together you'll hardly notice the distinction.
But the real star of La La Land is writer and director Damien Chazelle, who also delivered the inspiring and challenging Whiplash in 2014. Plainly sufficiently inspired by music to largely build his movies around it, Chazelle is also canny enough to appreciate that the non-musical sequences are equally important to the overall success of the picture.
Also enormously impressive is Justin Hurwitz' musicwords, lyrics, and orchestrations. If the ballad The Fools Who Dream doesn't draw a tear from the viewer's eye, call a cardiologist, quick. The song is delivered by Stone toward the end of the picture, during the audition that will make or break her career. And the wistful delicacy of Stone's performance of the song nicely summarizes the emotion of every man or woman who knows the feeling of making a decision based on their heart rather than their mind.
Plainly, La La Land is a movie made by people who love movies, for people who love movies. Proceed with caution: See this picture only if you want to be moved as deeply as you want to be entertained.""With all the hype the movie ""La La Land"" was getting during this Award season and the countless nominations it received I wanted to see what all the noise about this movie was about. To my surprise it was actually pretty good! Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were phenomenal in it and the songs and music were extraordinary. I would recommend this movie to anyone especially if they were into Jazz or musical type of movies. It almost sorta of reminded me of growing back in the day and watching High Scholl Musical or even watching Grease. Last but certainly not least I didn't know that Emma and Ryan can hold a tone and also can Ryan play the piano did he have to learn for this part and John Legend being in this movie was the icing on the cake for me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wow, Denzell Washington and Viola Davis are superb here, but if you think about it, Washington is playing two different characters in the movie. With his working stiff buddy Bono (Stephen Henderson) he's a brash and entertaining storyteller, regaling one and all with tales from his past that get rosier with each telling. I couldn't believe the way he dissed Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, stating that he was a better ball player than either of them.
But because Troy Maxson (Washington) was a man who's time has passed him by, he takes out his frustrations on older son Lyons (Russell Hornsby), who he considers a slacker with a poor work ethic, and his teenage boy Cory (Jovan Adepo), who has dreams of his own to play football, earn a scholarship, and make a better life for himself.
The killer scene occurs when Troy confronts wife Rose (Viola Davis) with the news that he's 'going to be a daddy'. Never have I seen an actor or actress turn on a dime so quickly, from a composed and motherly woman into one who's rage and emotion explodes so viscerally on screen. You watch Davis's face transform and it's a wonder to behold. Right there was where I became convinced she'll have an Oscar in waiting, so we'll just have to wait and see.
At the time I saw this film I wasn't aware that the story was based on a stage play, which makes the picture more dialog driven than most. For me, that's just fine, as I like to see a story in which the players are given ample opportunity to develop their characters. In this one, Troy Maxson is a man you like and dislike at the same time, and an actor who can accomplish that is a rare commodity. This will be one movie to keep an eye on with the potential to upset the apple cart during the coming awards season.""Good, understated acting in a gripping human interest story against a backdrop of modern day real world grit which should shame and anger us all. I was actually moved to tears, after initially fearing that the film would be a weak and slushy, sentimental drama so typical of the genre. Sure, there are moments when the viewer's emotions are manipulated - as in every film - but who wouldn't be moved by these events? Sensitively handled, the story is so well told that we are with Sheroo all the way and left wanting to know more about the real story and characters. This happened so recently. More films like this, please.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This film is based on World War 2 when an American soldier who is a medic who joins the army and fights for his country during the battle of Okinawa, with one big catch as he will not kill people. This film is based on the life and true events of one American solider who is ""Desmond T. Doss.
This film is directed by Mel Gibson who is back to his best by acting in his most recent hit movie ""Blood Father "" and makes his directing return with this blockbuster movie which is a Oscar nominated movie.
This film is fully of drama, action, thrilling, scary and very emotionally moments during the whole family. Very good casts put together by Mel Gibson which stars : Andrew Garfield , Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn.
Hacksaw Ridge is one of those movies, that you need to pay attention and watch every single scene. Hacksaw Ridge is a very emotional movie, story telling about one of America's heroes because of what he believed in. This is a very powerfully movie which Mel Gibson has brought to life for us to watch. This movie for me is one of the best war movies and army be just better than Saving Private Ryan, only because Hacksaw Ridge is based on real and true events where Saving Private Ryan is a fictional story.
I have to say that this is a most watch movie at IMAX, so please do not make the same mistake as i have done and go and watch this movie at IMAX to get the best of this brilliant war movie.
Andrew Garfield for me has to win an Oscar for his two best acting performance in Silence and most importantly for his role in this movie ""Hacksaw Ridge"". Andrew Garfield plays the role of Desmond T. Doss and does a very good job showing us what kind of a person Desmond T. Doss is and how he kept true to his beliefs and will make you leave the cinema with so much emotional inside you and maybe mixed feelings of him because of his beliefs. Andrew does a top class acting as we get to take a took at the journey of Desmond T. Doss who wanted to fight for his country, but will not kill people which means even holding a gun. We get to see how emotional Desmond T. Doss was as he was the only solider who believed in what he believes in and was fighting against all odds just to fight for his country instead of sitting at home. We can to see lots of emotions showed by this heroic character throughout his eyes on how he became from a disliked man into an American hero.
Hugo Weaving was very good in this movie as he was acting as Desmond T. Doss father in the movie and does as a good job. He was also a solider and has been through many wars and witness his friends dying for their country and does not want to see his two songs buried. Also we get to see how the war has effected Desmond T Doss father as this unfortunately is a thing that happens to most soldiers who wish that they where dead instead of being live because of all the killing that they have done and losing so many friends.
Vince Vaughn acts as the sergeant of the camp where Desmond T. Doss goes to train and became a solider. He was very good in this movie and has his funny moments but does a great job as a sergeant who at first does not like Desmond T. Doss but as the film progress he starts to like and have respect for him as a solider and as a man.
For me what made this film special and very good, was the big shooting scene and especially the scene where you see Desmond T. Doss carrying his fellow injured soldiers back to safety which was so heart warming and catching for me in which made the movie just too god for me to give it a bad rating as this movie is a five star movie because of its drama and emotions thrown into this picture.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First of all, I must say that it was a delight to see Kevin Costner after a long hiatus. He was amazing as always. However, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson are women after my own heart. As a Black woman who attended two predominantly White institutions in the South. Alabama, to be exact, where people are still just as prejudice as they always were, and there has been very little progress in race relations. I still managed to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Biology, a minor in Chemistry, and currently working on my Masters in Rural Community Health, and going for my PhD in Epidemiology. It was always my dream as a little girl to work for The CDC, The Pentagon, or NASA.
This movie was phenomenal! It shows that despite having the cards stacked against you, it can be done. As an African-American woman with a love for science who is trying to make it in an industry predominantly run by White males, I was deeply moved by such an inspirational film. Black women are rarely shown in a positive light in film or in any other form of the ""entertainment"" industry for that matter, so it was really refreshing to see this.
It does bother me that people always take whatever opportunity they can to compare feminism to racism when there is no comparison. I appreciate this movie for taking an honest approach to the situation, especially since being a woman only comes second to being a Black woman. Black is all people see first and foremost, so being a Black woman only makes it that much harder to get ahead. Above all else, at least White women have always had the color of their skin working in their favor, which is why I will never understand why this comparison is even a comparison at all. On top of that, people can call it racist propaganda all they like if it makes them feel better to bury their heads in the sand and pretend like these things never existed when in fact they did. We'll just pretend that the Black people made up the Jim Crow laws of the South to avoid offending people. I THINK NOT! Coming from someone who was born and raised in the heart of where the Civil Rights Movement took place, who's grandmother, Eva Lou Billingsley Russell, was a foot soldier in the movement. I can safely say there is no ""propaganda"" here!
In many ways, that's the way it still is today, so these are not things of the past. I actually did a research project on the stereotypical representations of African-American women in contemporary television, although it was also from a reality television perspective, so I am fully aware of the hegemonic labels the media seems determined to keep circulating about Black women. They want us all depicted as mistresses to White men or portraying one of the many stereotypical labels placed on Black women. For example, the roles they want us to play always consist of being ""The Angry Black Woman,"" ""The Whore/Groupie,"" ""The Hood Girl,"" ""The Video Vixen,"" ""The Gold Digger,"" ""The Baby Mama,"" and ""The Bourgeois Woman."" We are hardly ever shown as someone who is intelligent, ambitious, and classy. I can say this because these are only a fraction of the stereotypes, assumptions, and preconceived notions I face as an educated Black woman involved in an interracial relationship in the South.
I appreciate a movie being made about how smart, talented, and educated Black women are. We are much more than the images that people put out about us. We are Mathematicians! We are Chemists! We are Engineers! We are Physicists. We are Doctors! We are Scientists!
Now, I'll prepare to be down voted...""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This film really highlights the events that took place in 2010. It is a mind blowing film which plays on one emotions. The disaster that occurred and the lives lost are depicted well.This film deserves a high rating not only for the production but for the cast too. The whole production team have done an excellent job with the special effects and then script. You would have to decide for yourself, if you believe all the facts in the film, however I did. The film showed finesse and a true heart breaking story. I would highly advise people who are into natural and man made disaster films to watch this. I believe it is one of the best films to come out in the last few years.""Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens  Simply an outstanding piece of cinema. Lemme start with the story; Firstly straight from the beginning the iconic rolling credits mixed with John Williams amazing score puts a massive grin on my face, the actual credits explain the following story very clearly. The story itself is told beautifully through JJ Abrams vision who does justice and more to George Lucas' universe. JJ manages to perfectly pace the film with no scene being boring or useless. A huge amount of pressure paid off.
Chewbacca and Han Solo in a still from the Star Wars: The ForceThe striking visuals are so delightful to look at with vibrant colours and great cinematography, your eyes never look away from the screen with every gorgeous frame. A step up from the prequels and their awful CGI it is a breath of fresh air to see practical effects used in this film. Furthermore, the humour is quite surprising, with BB-8 gaining a lot of laughs, even if it is just a robot it has lovely characteristics like many of the human characters.
Regarding the characters  they all done an incredible job. In my opinion, the stand out performance was Adam Driver who plays Kylo Ren, an awesome antagonist who shows his dominance and emotion through his body language. Alongside him is Domhnall Gleeson who also stood out for me although not being in it much he does steal every scene he is in with his passionate anger. Meanwhile the two protagonists Finn and Rey both have excellent chemistry through humour and emotion  not to forget Poe Dameron a cool and lovable person played by the impressive Oscar Issac, credit to JJ for telling everyone's story just enough for us to keep on wanting to learn more about them, a great set-up for Rian Johnson to further our understanding of the characters.
Filled with pleasant and 'unpleasant' surprises, this is a film that will go down as one of the greats, with excitement, laughter, sadness, happiness and a range of other emotions pumping throughout the whole film. Flaws? A few minor ones but nothing major that ruins the film. Best film of 2015  Easily. Best Star Wars film I've seen  Yes. Will be interesting to see how Rian Johnson reacts to this with Episode VIII. To conclude, just go watch it.""While most professional critics were pretty hard on 'Trolls', attacking it's forced upbeat tone and synthetic nature, and while I can understand those comments and more importantly that it lacks the depth and risk-taking of the very best animated films, I can't dismiss the bottom line that I had a very good time watching this, laughing out loud a number of times.
Basically the Trolls are an absurdly happy lot, whereas the comparatively giant Bergens are miserable by nature. Except when they eat a Troll. Then they briefly become happy before falling back into malaise. Hence, conflict! :-)
There are some very funny, witty lines, some great character designs, some effective animated slapstick, and some clever, slightly twisted use of songs from the 70s and 80s. Yes, cynically those songs were probably used to help the adults in the audience who brought their kids, but they work really well in the context of the film.
This IS a film aimed at younger kids. It doesn't have the more sophisticated plot and character twists of  for example  the Pixar films. But it does have a good heart and a silly sense of humor (and even a nice message), and  at least on the night I saw it  that was enough for this old guy (and my wife), both a good 10 times older than the audience this was aimed at.""Greetings from Lithuania.
""The Girl with All the Gifts"" (2016) is hands down the most fresh, original and best zombie movie I've seen in many moons. This is a very intriguing movie to start with, the opening is terrific, middle until the end. The very ending of this movie was kinda... strange, it wasn't as good as the rest of the movie. Still ""The Girl"" delivers good. Acting was good by all involved and especially by Sennia Nanua who played Melanie - she was terrific. I loved how this movie shows post apocalyptic world. And more then one time i though about ""The Last of Us"" when watching this movie, whey are very close in stories.
Overall, ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" is s superb genre picture. For all who loves zombie movies, this is a gift and a must see.""For the record.. I'm usually not a fan of Mr Franco's work or off that of his friends. That being said.. back to this movie.
Usually a movie has to hit a sweet spot for me even trying to wrap my thoughts about it, let alone bother to review it. When i saw the trailer i thought.. that's it. The movie will only go downhill from here on out. But it didn't. It didn't brought unexpected surprises, well not many but it did what it promised: make you laugh and really feel good at the end of it. And when a movie makes up on its promises, then i feel its done its job. The grand moments, you've MOSTLY seen in the trailer, but there is still a lot that wasn't shown. Also the story line was still for most parts refreshing which was also a pleasant treat. Every cast member seemed to have fun with their role and the plot and that clearly shows. You also get some great cameo's who i wont spoil.
So if you enjoy a funny movie that hits the sweet spots, then this one is for you. Don't believe all the hate posts. Be your own person and watch this with an open mind. You wont be disappointed,""After Winter Soldier I was under the (apparently mistaken) belief that Marvel's Capt. America franchise was criticising neoliberal America. There was all that stuff about the ends not justifying the means and about how politicians use terror to convince the population they need to be oppressed for their own good. How wrong could I be! Now I see that it's actually the opposite. It pretends to be anti-establishment but really it's just about justifying a sense of self-entitlement. Like Donald Trump, Capt. America criticises the State for oppressing people whilst simultaneously adhering to exactly the sort of high-handed moral superiority that inevitably leads to that oppression.Btw, Scarlett is awesome,you can see this http://www.haberligunler.com/scarlett- johansson-2016-yilinda-en-cok-kazanan-oldu-7379-haber . He (I mean Capt. America) obviously skipped school on the day they taught the importance of checks-and-balances and why one of the central principles of US Democracy is that of the separation of powers.""What a sweet film! Like Birdman, this is a very unique picture that offers something revolutionary to the eyes and ears.
It fits into the category of complete escapism, like in the Golden Age of cinema. If you are looking for a musical with political or social overtones, you may be disappointed. This is a very simple story about love and following your dreams in Hollywood.
It manages to avoid a lot of the cheesy parts and is not your average musical you see on Broadway.
The two leads are brilliant to watch and extremely likable. And the production design is breathtakingly beautiful. This movie will definitely win a lot of awards. ;)""Dan Brown has made a fortune on his thrillers with secrets hidden in art books and this latest screen adaptation continues the flavor of his concept that started with The Da Vinci Code, then Angels and Demons, and now Inferno. He has a formula that works cinematically (with a screenplay by David Koepp) and if this current adaptation isn't quite p to par the blame is shifted to director Ron Howard and the excessive use of CGI effects that move the drama away from the close tie to art and literature of ancient Italy. Still it is Dan Brown, and he knows how to spin a tale.
Set very solidly in contemporary times we first meet the character Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) and his plan to control the overpopulation of the earth with a diabolical release of a new virus that infect the masses and reduce the population to 50 % of its present status. Enter the famous symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia and finds himself the target of a manhunt. Langdon teams up with Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), an ER doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories. Together, they race across Europe and against the clock to stop a madman from unleashing a global virus that would wipe out half of the world's population. The World Health Organization is involved as are spies and the usual bad guys  with several prominent roles played by Sidse Babett Knudsen (Robert's ex-lover), Omar Sy, Irrfan Khan, Ana Ularu, Ida Darvish, among others.
The beauty of the film is the magnificence of Florence, Italy, Istanbul, Turkey, Budapest, Hungary, and Venice, Italy and of course the artwork that plays so significant a part in the mystery of the hunt for the container of 'The Virus.' The story has been doctored unnecessarily, weakening it is many ways from the book, but the thrust is there  and Tom Hanks once again pulls it off well. INFERNO may not be perfect but it is a fine evening's entertainment  with some significant commentary about power and population control and the environment tossed in for controversy.""This excellently-made movie is in the tradition of 28 Days Later and its sequel. Unlike other ''survival'' movies or shows, there are no hero-figures - nothing syrupy. That is what makes this movie three-dimensional. Its about the antihero. The acting from the main characters are superb - especially Gemma Aterton and Sennia Nanua. The music - especially the eerie repetitive vocal chant - gives it an avant-garde post-apocalyptic feel. This movie makes you think at every turn. Even the ending - suspecting a Philip K. Dickian turn - had me go, ''Oh, no!'' It's a slow-paced movie without ever giving feeling that it was dragging. More please!""We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!""A film about aliens that deals with humanity . Taking on a very different approach to the usual sci-fi arrival themed alien movies where aliens are only after our resources and planet , Arrival explores multiple unseen aspects of what aliens might be like from appearance and origin to alteria motives hidden to us due to our humanity . Despite falling to the usual Hollywood theme of vilainizing foreign powers like China and Russia and portraying again the Americans as the only rational thinking country of the planet earth (Donald Trump seriously ? ) this movie is by far one of the best sci-fi thrillers/drama to date . Using hard science to back up its theories and understandings that we have acquired recently as a species about how space , time and the understanding of these variables tie together with the way we perceive the world , the movie stands apart from Alien invasion and VFX overload movies and delivers suspense and drama in a league of its own . Some call it slow going , however time is relevant.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Marvel movies like the movies of its parent company Disney are the literal definition of mediocre and overrated. Through out the decade long tenure of the Marvel cinematic universe and over 10 big budget releases I can say with certainty that no one of the movies released stood out as an actually good comic book movie. Maybe an exciting action flick but not a good comic book movie and this is where even Fox surpasses Marvel let alone Sony with Spiderman films or Warner with its DC titles. Iron man didn't cut it and Avengers with its Chitauri invasion plot certainly didn't either. The reason for that is two things cinematography of Marvel movies which is uninspiring to say the least and Marvel's usual lack of interest or ability in preservation of its source material when transferred over to the big screen. Take Civil War into consideration a movie I watched again recently just prior to watching Doctor Strange and still ended it with being confused by the sheer idiocy of it. Marvel has been doing some really unappreciated things with its source material since the first day and when you want to bring in the comic book fans, the people that have made mcu actually possible you just should not treat these materials so badly. This is why the general consensus among the hardcore comic book community about mcu is mediocrity. In fact the only other movie of the mcu to come close is Guardiana of Galaxy and won't you know it it was a movie loved by both the average movie goer and the hardcore comic book fan.
So lets see what Doctor Strange did right. Doctor Strange kept it very real and close to the original material, it didn't mess around with important characters and plot points too much and kept it on point and interesting. There was no line or no shot wasted every thing had a point and delivered on its promise of leading to something else. The visual effects of the movie was just amazing, the cinematography of this movie was very well done and it was very good for a comic book movie. it was breathtaking to watch and if it wasn't for that explosion a few years back called inception it would have been really really ground breaking, alas. The choice of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange was perfect, he is a Supreme actor playing the part of sorcerer Supreme. The changes made to the Ancient One although unfortunate did not affect the character on a fundamental level and is possible to be ignored. The sound effects are sharp and good but the soundtrack vague and bland. The movie also includes the signature humor of mcu yet again while here unlike Avengers 2 or many other Marvel movies it does fit the situation and this actor,even though origin story of Strange is very dark and serious. Talking about origin story there were indeed some plot points missing in the movie like the first encounter of Strange and the people ofnthe ancient one or the monsters attacking earth etc but thid movie managed to savor as much as possible and very good at that too. It was very refreshing to watch a mcu film that didn't dumb down its plot to hide bad writing. Maybe it has a lot to do with the fact that this movie was much more visual heavy than dialog heavy but whatever it was I know I want more of thid. I can only hope that Black Panther movie follows something similar.""I know that some of this movie was messed around with. If you read an actual biography, you will find some inaccuracies, but that doesn't matter because this movie is about the personal dreams of the average guy. Rudy Ruettiger is a young guy whose family works in a steel mill and Rudy is probably doomed to that life. It's not terrible but it is dangerous (Rudy's best friend dies) and the young guy wants a better life. He is a very good high school football player with a lot of heart, but this will probably be the end of his playing days. Rudy is a disinterested student, so his chances of even getting into college are almost nil. When a group of seniors are going on a college trip to Norte Dame, he is not allowed on the bus. But he has a dream and he heads off to South Bend and tries to talk his way in. He ends up going to Holy Cross, a nearby school, and he is told that if he can get high grades, they will look at him again. Well, we all know the story. He qualifies academically. He manages to get on the scout squad at Notre Dame by showing that he is willing to nearly kill himself to impress the coaches. But they won't give him a chance to play in a game, which means he isn't actually a true member of the historical powerhouse. Until something happens. If you've never seen this, go for it.""from movie making point of view this is very good.But from the ""thought inspiring"" viewpoint it is one of the best.The thought inspiring nature of movies is the only thing that is needed to learn things.
Now about the movie making view For making a movie one needs 2 things -idea and format.The idea is itself a high one i.e Dan brown's.The format should have been varying from it but it fully agrees with the idea.And to the extent both agrees is what the output is.Overall it is very thought inspiring. Learn and Fun -these are the two things that are needed for entertainment of the mass and also individuals.One of these or both are final things that a movie needs at the end.""I have to say that I agree with ""westenicho"" and that users comments about user ""Russ-was-here"" comments. I do not see anywhere in the film makers write ups where it states this is a factual presentation, maybe based on historical events which means they could take one battle form one area and supplant it in another. So if you want a 100% factual representation of the time, this is not for you, what it is, is a great entertaining movie and factual enough to believe the characters and their trials and tribulations. I think the acting was superb and as much as it is not a movie for the Oscars, it is an entertaining movie for family, Sc-Fi, Historical, Roman, History, and Ancient U.K. and surrounds history. Not enough gore so as your 8 year old could not watch but enough so this 53 year old male could enjoy. So watch it for what it is, a tale of long ago and the way things where as seen by the writers and directors whom I thank for bring this film to my lounge room. The scenery is great as well as costumes (even if they are not 100% factual), just a great entertaining movie, worth watching. I have seen it 3 times now and think it is worth a good 8+ or in the movies an A- for acting, direction, filming and particularly Set and Costumes""It is a very different kind of movie but it was definitely worth my time. So amazing. It made me cry. You can watch this on Netflix. It is amazing.

Sam has to go to the toilet and while there witnesses a murder. It later emerges that the dead man was a policeman and while in the police station looking through photographs to identify the killer Sam spots him not in a mugshot but a photograph of a policeman. Detective John Book realises this is a dangerous situation so takes the matter to his boss. Soon after he is ambushed and wounded by one of the killers; he knows that he, Sam and his mother are in real danger so he takes them out of the city and back to their home in Lancaster County.
Shortly after dropping them off he collapses due to his wound; he is treated by the Amish and as he recovers he must help in the local community and dress like one of them. While his former colleagues are trying to find where he has gone he continues to live among the Amish and grows close to Rachel; a closeness that could threaten her position in society that sees her as getting too close to an outsider and his inappropriate ways. Eventually he will have to face the corrupt cops to save both himself and those he has recently grown close to.
On the face of it this could have been really corny but instead we get a really good story. It is hard to pin it down to a genre; at first it appears to be a crime drama but really that is just an excuse to force city cop John Book to live among the Amish; a society totally alien to what he is used to. Then there is the romance between Book and Rachel; in some ways this reminded me of 'Brief Encounter'; while neither character is married here there would still be problems if they got involved because of the rules of her society something Book grows to understand and respect. The cast does a really good job; especially Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis as Book and Rachel. There is a small amount of violence and swearing as well as some brief nudity but for the most part things are things are fairly gentle. It may be over thirty years old but it has hardly dated as the majority of the film is set amongst the Amish and I don't imagine their society has changed as much as the rest of America has. Overall I'd certainly recommend this excellent film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I give it only 8/10 because it became dull sometimes. But the movie captured the intensity of war in a very unique way.
Questioning what is the right decision, and told from numerous perspectives, a pair of pilots who have never had to kill, a colonel who is willing to do almost anything to accomplish the mission, and political leaders. It shows you how every life taken was a human, who lived, breathed, and was loved by others. Intentionally killing an innocent person for the greater good is a much bigger complication than most believe.
Several scenes were incredibly beautiful, such as the terrorists, who are supposed to be degenerate scumbags, helping the girl. And the generals line ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of a war."" Words cannot describe the moment.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Can you guess what my favorite movie is? STAR WARS! Well no that's my favorite saga. My favorite stand-alone movie is ""The Wizard of Oz"". I have a bit of a movie memorabilia collection in my studio. Don't you judge me! Needless to say I was very excited as well as very skeptical about this so called unofficial prequel. Especially in this troubled CGI world of ours and most of all when I saw ""Trailer no.1"". at the point where ""and the producer of Alice in Wonderland"" came up on the screen I cringed and had nightmares of crazy moving cameras and fancy creatures with sparkly heads and fluid faces and 3D headaches. And then the river fairies come into the shot and those weird piranha plants and I knew! Deep down I knew! They would ruin my OZ with CGI!
But those where little nothings in the scheme of the grand canvas that is ""OZ the Great and Powerful""
Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I loved this movie. I sat back and watched it with one eye closed expecting to see something bad! You know, kind of like waiting for toast to pop out. But nothing really bad happened. It had a good story and good points, and it was fun! I loved all the nods to ""The Wizard of OZ"", and loved that we are introduced to things that you will see in the next movie. You get some questions answered and even though we all know the rules you still get a couple of surprises. ""Only bad witches are ugly"" and boy are they ugly!
There are so many layers to the OZ films that once can go crazy psycho analyzing them! That actually would be a fun night. Even though we now have a backstory to why the witch hates pretty girls, why there is a feud between her and OZ why is the wizard a man behind the curtain? There are still so many unanswered questions
Is OZ a real place? If Dorothy went there, saw Oscar the Wizard who IS still there, and came back then it must be a real place Are the ruby slippers the only way out? Their power is the power to leave OZ? The witch's plan was to leave and come here to the real world? If so would they be going to Kansas? Why two different people almost 50 years apart both got sucked into the OZ Vortex in the same state? Is Kansas a wormhole to a parallel universe where your farmhands are animals and creatures? Or is it children's limbo! Where the dead go to wait to be judged? But it wasn't Dorothy's time yet so they sent her back? In a parallel land that still has North, South, East and West? Blow your mind!
Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says I had problems with some things I had a problem with the lion, don't ask, just watch it and get back to me. I had a problem with the CGI! Not the characters themselves, the monkeys where done right. I mean the landscapes and moving parts and extravagant camera movements that are so far-fetched the people themselves must be CGI to be in them! When the Director of photography says the phrase ""Camera cranes can't go that high!"" and the Director says ""Who needs a camera ANIMATE IT!"" we have a problem! I feel weird about James Franco! I like him, I hear he will be in a movie and I say ""WHY?"" then I watch it and can't picture anyone else in it and he does a good job. He was wholesome in this with a big dash of con man and it worked. The witches where amazing, Mila Kunis was acting like something else we have never seen and she didn't sound like Meg! (Family Guy) Which is a plus! WITCH is a plus, which old Witch? The Wicked Witch! (and now that song is stuck in your head)
Jack ""The Parent"" says DUH Take the kids Well take MY kids because they all loved it! They are 4, 9 and 10 years old. We saw it in 3D so be careful of the jump at your face elements, there are some jolts that make you sit back like the monkeys and the witch at some points. And there is a bit of some tear-jerking moments at the end but aside from that it's a good story for them to follow.
In a magical world not everything is what it seems, not everyone is telling the truth and you should not try to be someone you are not for the sake of a loved one. Be yourself and do your best with what talents you have. You don't have to have magic powers to save the day! You can be anyone's hero if you believe in yourself!""1941. An American, Rick Blain (Humphrey Bogart), runs a nightclub in Casablanca. Morocco is German/Vichy French-controlled and Blain goes to great lengths to appear neutral in the conflict. He is a businessman, though his clients tend to be those opposing the Axis powers. Rick's world is thrown into turmoil when a former flame, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), walks back into his life.
As brilliant and as much a classic as it is made out to be. Great, engaging story. Excellent dialogue, helped by the coolness and swagger of Bogart. Just about every line is quotable.
Superb performances by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains.
Won the Best Picture Oscar in 1944.""Greetings from Lithuania.
I can believe of how involving and intriguing ""The Third Man"" (1949) actually is after seeing it just now for a first time in 2017. This is a movie which stood the test of time. Now for a second this movie in term of its narrative, script, writing, acting and directing looked like of felt like it was made back in 1949. All of the above mentioned parts of the film were more then great - they were a head of its time. Now i also loved how somehow darkly funny this movie was and especially the whole story if you think about it - i won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the story about a novelist desperately trying for find out about his closed friends dead and how it all ends its just a funny, darkly funny thing. Music as well cinematography were also great.
Overall, while ""The Third Man"" isn't perfect nor it blew my away like some other films of the period, this is a great film overall, a bit a head of its time.""a quirky movie its a testimony to human capacity for ruthlessness and Marilyn Monroe does well to play the part of a woman only concerned with her interests but one thing continues to puzzle me about the movie I found on the street how does cotton figure out the success message of the bells ringing their what they say is their special tune? I watched three times but still couldn't see it shown how he figures it out ,in summary one of the best movies ever made i ONLY JUST SAW IT FOR FIRST TIME EVEN THOUGH I'm 65 ID OF NEVER SAW IT IF i HADNT FOUND ON STREET i WATCH MOVIES RARELLY expected this to be junk but was surprised how unique it was""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When this film came out in theaters I heard mixed reviews saying that it's either for you or isn't. That being said after finally watching the film I can't believe how great it was. This is not a perfect 10/10 film but its crazy good. Daniel Radcliffe's character is stupid af and yet I fell in love with him. Paul Dano was also great but Daniel blew me away (with his farts). This film is about Paul who is stuck on an island about to kill himself discovers a body (Radcliffe) and slowly brings him back to life. Pauls character was dead on the inside and by showing Daniel how great life can be he himself begins to come back to life. The story takes place on an island and in a forest/jungle and they make their way back to civilization. What these two characters go through together enriches their friendship and surprisingly it moves us even with some ridiculous premises. The music in the film is amazing and the performances are fantastic. I may be praising the film only because it shouldn't have worked and not only did it work but it exceeded that. Overall, I give Swiss Army Man an 8.5/10. This is a survival comedy at heart with some twists and turns.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** George Cuckor became famous for his portrays of female characters and 'Gaslight' is no exception. Paola starts by being a shadow of her aunt mysteriously killed at her house in London. She seems destined to follow on her steps, even accepting to move back to the place where the murder happened. She then convinces herself she has lost her mind and finally turns around to find herself and see reality as it is. This process is brilliantly and subtly conducted by Cuckor, making the best use of Ingrid Bergman's talent, who gives the performance of a lifetime. 'Gaslight' is in many ways a display of Hollywood golden age, with a good script being served by a solid director and an all-star cast.""Just a few remarks on seeing the movie again years after its initial release. What a cleverly constructed screenplay (Polanski). We never know more than central character Rosemary (Farrow). That way her gradual realization becomes ours too. Of course, we know in advance from the film's reputation that an infernal plot is underway to envelop her, but still the narrative captivates. Who exactly is involved in the plot remains unclear, along with the details. Tip-offs gradually emerge as when old Minnie (Gordon) insists on the hellish concoction that Rosemary must drink. But then Gordon plays Minnie in such a goofy gadfly manner, it's hard to think of her as a witch. All in all, it's that clever narrative construction combining our awareness with Rosemary's that's the crux of a fascinating film. And given the lengthy two-hour-plus runtime, that's no mean fete. Then too, shouldn't overlook Farrow's career topping performance as the besieged victim. In fact, it's hard for me to think of anyone else as the waifish mother-to-be. Anyway, it's a brilliant horror film in spite of spilling scarcely a drop of blood. Contemporary filmmakers could take note.""I'm not a fan of the horror genre and I have to admit that I get scared easily. There are some films though that I just couldn't miss and Rosemary's Baby is one of them. Watching it made me realize once again how big is the gap between our days and the 60's. The film has nothing to do with horror movies released in the 21st century and actually it isn't that scary. That's not to say it isn't good. On the contrary, it's a great psychological thriller that keeps you wondering until the very end.
Set in New York City, the story starts with a young couple, Rosemary and Guy (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes respectively), recently married as it seems, who are looking to buy an apartment. They eventually settle in the ""Bramford"" dismissing their friend Hutch's (Maurice Evans) scary stories about infamous incidents that happened there. They soon get befriended by the wealthy old couple that lives next to them, Minnie and Roman (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer respectively). When under strange circumstances Rosemary gets pregnant, Minnie and Roman offer their help. Minnie arranges for her to have one of the best obstetricians in the city and prepares a herbal drink for her every day. As the day of delivery comes closer mysterious events start to occur that cause Rosemary to be suspicious of everyone around her.
Roman Polanski proves his immerse talent in this film which is actually his first book adaptation ever. Supposedly, he was unaware that directors often adjusted book stories to make their films, resulting in Rosemary's Baby being the most faithful adaptation ever according to the author Ira Levin. Polanski (or maybe we should say Levin) effectively manipulates the audience from the beginning of the film. We are first presented with ominous events and rumours so to get a feeling that something terrible is going to happen. However, as we move on, despite Rosemary's fears and suspicions, there's hardly any proof for her outrageous allegations. She suspects her neighbours, but all they do is provide her with a herbal drink. She suspects her obstetrician, but he is one of the most renowned in the city, respected even by people that she trusts like Hutch and Dr. Hill. So, since we only follow the events from her point of view, we begin to doubt her. I mean, it's only natural for a mother to worry too much for her unborn child. What if all these are just in her imagination and the 2-3 unfortunate events are just coincidences? Unfortunately, the film's reputation precedes it. I knew something was going to happen from the beginning. It must have been a great experience back in 1968 when the audience was completely unaware of it. It still makes for an exhilarating picture though. The most impressive thing about the film, and the one that differentiates it so much from modern horror films, is that we never see anything visually scary. We don't see any gory scenes or scary satanic rituals or jump scares. We don't even get to see a single glimpse of the baby! It's all in the mind.
Technically, Rosemary's Baby is flawless. Roman Polanski did an excellent job. The acting is solid and it's no surprise that Ruth Gordon's portrayal of the sinister Minnie Castevet won an Oscar. The score is the icing on the cake and the mesmerizing lullaby sung by Mia Farrow at the beginning and end of the film is one of the most memorable and haunting elements of the feature. What else is needed to say when the film is still discussed and analyzed today almost 50 years later? Even the reclusive Stanley Kubrick was reportedly impressed by it. An amazing picture altogether.

Roy Scheider's performance is a revelation. He gets a larger, more fleshed out role, hence allowing Brody to be the symbol of paranoia.
The possibility of another killer shark is usually dismissed as inevitable, but the shark is merely used as a vehicle to expose Brody's almost Captain Ahab like features. I think the idea of the story is to show Brody's evolution into Quint. Evidence of this can be drawn from the opening scene, where two divers (resembling Brody) are eaten by a shark (obsession) stalking the sunken Orca.
The film was helms under Jeannot Szwarc, hired after John D. Hancock, director of the 1973 masterwork Bang The Drum Slowly, was fired after proving inadequate. Szwarc is not necessarily a very good director, but he does outdoes himself with Jaws 2, most likely due to a script so much better than those for his other films.
In the final product you have an unnerving, downbeat, near-excellent sequel that, while having no real reason for existence, works so well that it can be forgiven.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Lion King is a 1994 Walt Disney animated movie about a little lion Prince, Simba born in a lion royalty and his jealous uncle, Scar who wants to take the throne from his brother, Mufasa. Scar kills Mufasa and Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was his fault, and so he flees the Kingdom into exile. In his exile, he meets some of our favorite childhood characters Timon and Pumbaa.
The Lion King is a movie of exhilarating surprises and at its times it wasn't just a movie it was a marketing phenomenon. Simba is played by two actors, younger version Johnathan Taylor Thomas and older version Matthew Broderick. The movie also stars Darth Vader himself James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Ernie Sabella as Pumba, Nathan Lane as Timon and many more.
The Lion King is one of the most respected animated movies. Often times people have compared the story to William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Let's just also mention the stunning visual miracles by 600 Disney artisans, who bring the African landscape to stunning life. It's that kind of animation artistry that raises The Lion King above the level of superior kid stuff and into the realm of a royal treat.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Bee Movie is awesome. It has great CGI, great voice cast, a pretty decent story, and many funny moments. This film is perfect for those who have a fascination for bees. Some people who don't might also enjoy it, too. However, this movie can be a little strange. One reason is the fact that it's pretty much about Barry B. Benson, whom is a bee, suing the human race over their honey consumption, which is weird on its own, but what's weirder is that Barry is dating Vanessa Bloome, whom is a human. Uhh, okay?.. But other than that, this film is entertaining and a joy to watch. It may not attract everyone, but I believe it is enough for me to recommend. Though it isn't the best Dreamworks film, it's still good enough to be remembered as a pretty big staple in the list of Dreamworks films""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a very amusing mockumentary style movie that focuses in on a few vampires that act like brothers. And their dynamics with one another when it comes to doing choirs, when new comers get involved and how they go about dealing with humans. I didn't particularly find this to be hilarious, but I got a few laughs out of it and it was very amusing to sit through. Maybe it's because the actors played their parts so well to the point it just came off very natural. Maybe it's their personalities in real life, but the interactions came off amusing and natural. It really did seem like it's how the actors in this would act like if they were vampires. The executions when it comes to the vampire elements onto screen is very cleverly done. It's like they thought up a lot of fun and creative ideas when it comes to the vampire myths and mashed it all together into a mockumentary. But the thing is, it all works together fluently and it all fits together. To describe this mockumentary, it's like a mix of ""The Office"", ""Borat"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" when it comes to the dynamics and vibe of it all. It start to slightly drag an hour in but overall it was a bloody good time.
8/10""Now that's more like it! Last July, after I heralded Inception and Toy Story 3 as rescuing 2010 moviegoers from a year otherwise bereft of great storytelling, I received an email from a Dreamworks animator pointing me in the direction of How to Train Your Dragon. Word of mouth had been positive, but I had yet to check it out. Dreamworks Animation (Shrek, Over the Hedge, Monsters vs. Aliens) is known for targeting the funny bone of children and adults alike, but with the exception of Kung-Fu Panda, making films with heart and a spirit of adventure to match the humor hasn't seemed to be their priority.
With How to Train Your Dragon, however, Dreamworks has raised their standard, making the race for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars much more interesting. Combining truly stunning visuals with well-rounded characters, Dragon doesn't insult the intelligence of young viewers. It is moving and uplifting, thrilling and funny, and uses its fantasy story to explore profound themes of prejudice, searching for personal identity, and longing for acceptance by a parent. If this sounds heavy, don't worry: you'll have a great time, and the action is pretty terrific. Listen for a great turn by Gerard Butler as a Viking father.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** *I Will try not to use spoilers but will notify prior if I deem necessary for the review
Overall: This movie is, simply put, a work of art. Not perfect by any means but honestly this movie is excellent. Nolan hasn't failed me yet!
Good: The cinematography was phenomenal. The music was very well done and excellently crafted. All the acting from Hugh Jackman to Christian Bale to even Michael Caine, whom I was pleasantly surprised to see here, was incredible. The story itself is excellent with an incredible ending. Very well drawn and developed characters who each have their own motives and personas which drive them. The actual magic tricks themselves, while fake, where awesome and just were cool to witness.
Bad: The first act is a tad confusing and easily its weakest. Christian Bale's accent can get a tad annoying from time to time but that is a minor gripe.
Best Part: The Ending
MVP: Christian Bale as Alfred Borden
10/10"This is a great movie. See it. It is one of the best movies of all time. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. It also has great special effects. It also has great acting. It also has a great story line. It is not based on facts. That is why it is one of the best war movies of all time. 8.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a good movie that 8.3 is underrating it. I give it 9 out of 10 because it is a great movie. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. Great movie great movie great movie great movie great movie. P.S I.M.D.B will you please publish this I have lost count of how many times I have written it. Great movie. It is a must see. It has a lot of action. You need to see this movie. It is a great movie."*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" is a film regarding the wealthy Jenkins and her insistence of pursuing a singing career, even though she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket! Her singing ability was so limited, she may have been able to perform a song or two, but she sought out the most complex pieces to perform. Because she was very high in society, she was lauded as a great singer because (I suppose) no one wanted to hurt her feelings--and everybody knows the saying about ""money talks..."".
Meryl Streep is, as usual, simply mesmerizing in the lead role. It is simply amazing to me that having actual pipes and being able to sing, Ms. Streep actually had coaching to be able to caterwaul like she did. She was so convincing in this role, it was actually painful for me to watch--not to mention listen--to her butcher an aria. Hugh Grant was also top-notch in his performance, playing her ""husband,"" although the two led separate lives. Simon Helberg (of ""Big Bang Theory"") was impeccable as Ms. Jenkins' accompanist, Cosmos McMoon.
Again, this is a character driven movie and it can seem a little slow at times. If you just let yourself ""sink"" into it, I think you will be thoroughly entertained. Rated PG-13 (and very easily could have been PG), this one is worth your time.""The brilliance behind this movie is in the whole of human history known by one man and the way this person open up his story. There's an obvious ambiguity given the fact he doesn't have any proof to what he has been through but that's not necessary, this is purely for the imagination to run wild not to mention the interesting reaction behind the other people listening.
I would have preferred a less in-the-face revelation regarding the main character's influence in history, keeping him as a random person would have been more profound. That annoying Christian teacher was entirely unnecessary as well.""...or ""uncovering Mary Poppins"" would perhaps be a more appropriate title for this great film. If nothing else, this would certainly be much better than the stupid and totally irrelevant one the film had in my country ( ""The magic umbrella"") associating in a most naive and superficial way this touching psychological drama with W. Disney's ""Mary Poppins"". Perhaps that's why i did not care to watch it till yesterday, thinking that i have had enough of magic umbrellas in my childhood. I never thought that the film had nothing to do with ""Mary Poppins"" as a fairy tale and her magic umbrella itself, but it was instead focusing on uncovering the real drama that inspired the good witch's story. In this movie we actually watch two,at first glance irrelevant to each other, stories. One that took place in the beginning of last century in Australia and one that takes place in the beginning of the -60's when Mrs Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"" tries to come in terms with W. Disney about how the book would be transformed into a movie. Though it's difficult to understand at the very beginning why she is so unbearably stubborn and insisting on how the characters of the book would be shown and illustrated in the film and overall about the film itself, soon, as her own life's story unfolds making clear what her fairy-tale's characters really represent, her attitude and her almost repulsive behavior become more understandable and she herself more likable and compassionable. After all for many of us our childhood's demons are still a part of our life, consciously or subconsciously controlling and influencing our personalities and we all have a Mr Banks or an Elias Disney (Walt's ""demon"") to save/make up with, don't we? The film is really good and exciting to watch. Perhaps the excellent revival of the sixties and its characters contribute a lot to this. And of course the revival of these characters through the great performances of -my beloved- Emma Tomson in a ""contra role""-that is to say a role we are not used to seeing her in- as a typical aging English shrew, as well as that of Tom Hanks (great as Walt Disney) and the rest of the cast, make this revival absolutely convincing. In Brief, ""saving Mr. Banks"" is a really good, truthfully tender and touching film which does deserve your attention!""It's been 8 years, I love this movie. When I first watch it, I didn't want to go out of the cinema. It's the best movie I've ever watched. Until now, I watched it over a hundred of times and it didn't get bored. I love it. I love the actors and the actresses. I love the music. I love wonderful views. This is the most touching movie I've seen. In this movie I've heard ABBA's songs for the first time, yet I love all of them. In my opinion, there is a magic in this movie. It reminds me about my dreams and all the things I'm waiting for in my life. It also reminds me about all the good times and things I have had in my life. I very emotionally connect with this movie. Thank you very much for creating such a great movie.""Have seen the trailer I thought to give it a try. I didn't really knew what to expect because it showed that the trailer was hiding things.
Let me say that that was true. This flick goes over the top and can offend some viewers. Did I had a laugh, sure, over the top is no problem for me. You ask yourself were they went over the top, well, it do has a lot of sexual jokes so I wont recommend it to younger viewers, face it, the children do swear like a trooper but it's all funny. There are jokes with some existing actors and people but the offending stuff lays in the joke with elephants. You love or hate it.
The story itself isn't that bad after all. One brother working undercover and the other one being an England supporter. Together they will rescue earth.
Be sure to watch until the end which mean after the end credits there's a joke hidden. It's one big joke, stupid, funny, action, and exaggerated flick. I loved it but many will dislike this. To give you a reference, if Borat (2006) was your stuff then you will enjoy this.
Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 3 /5""*** This review may contain spoilers *** You may not have heard of this film. It was in very limited release almost fourteen years ago. I understand that this film requires a lot of patience to sit through. It isn't really enjoyable or entertaining. It is about two men, both named Gerry, who go hiking one day and both venture off from a wilderness trail. That is it. Hardly any dialogue. It is roughly 1 hour and 43 minutes. You may not want to see it and I would not blame you. Almost ten years ago I first watched this in its entirety and I really let myself go while viewing. It is a calming experience. It is rare that I feel that way while watching a movie. I marvel at the landscapes that are throughout this film. It is dreamlike. Sort of a personal trek I feel while watching this film. At some point, it feels quite maddening as if descending into an abyss. I suppose it could've been done differently or perhaps been more interesting, but this is a Gus Van Sant film. He is a visionary.""Pixar Animation Studios rarely falls short of beautiful, heartwarming features since their debut in 1995 when they delivered the revolutionary 'Toy Story'. Whether their biggest gem is their stellar technical abilities or their gift of bringing their heart-touching stories to life before our very eyes, Pixar never stops delivering the goods. Easily one of their most classic entries is director Andrew Stanton's 2003 feature 'Finding Nemo' which took audiences everywhere in an under-the-sea odyssey of a lovable clown fish in search of his lost son while acquiring the help of a funny, amnesiac blue tang. 13 years have passed and Pixar has managed to bring back most of our characters from the original and take us on another ride for relatively similar adventure. The biggest change here is unlike the predecessor which found Marlin and Dory searching for the young titular character, this one finds a new character in the Nemo's former position. And that is character is no one other than the lovable Dory, the fish suffering from her notorious short-term memory loss. Set one year after the events of the original, clown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voiced by Hayden Rolence) are home with the latter attending school and Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) being a helping hand with raising Nemo. Meanwhile, Dory is haunted by the memories of her family who she lost as a child, prompting her to set out to reunite with them. However, when she is unexpectedly kidnapped and placed in a Californian public aquarium, Marlin and Nemo was set out to rescue her.
When the original hit theaters back in the spring of 2003, Dory is by far the biggest show-stealer of the feature. Bringing on non-stop hilarity with her short-term memory loss and constantly being a burden to Marlin's search of his son due to her inability to remembering anything longer than a few seconds, why wouldn't it be a good idea to explore deep into the origins of this lovable character? This film opens with a long flashback of Dory as a young child with her parents, and how her parents coped with her short-term memory loss which is handled surprisingly well. Rather than establishing Dory as a source of utter annoyance, the story maturely handles her mental predicament as sympathy. Some time later, she finds herself separated from her parents and struggling vigorously to find them. Afterwards, the film jumps to the present with her living with Marlin and Nemo from the previous entry and that is when the story finally kicks off. Like the original film, her amnesia still lingers and is constantly struggling trying to memorize simple things longer than a matter of seconds. But as the adventure begins and the characters making fateful efforts on helping her reunite with her long-lost family, the film not ingeniously handles her amnesiac disorder with substance but effectively established Dory as a self-aware burden who knows her mental disability causes trouble. And this easily stands as one of the most emotional and heartfelt elements of the story. There is plenty of fun (including a ridiculous car chase at the end) and certainly plenty of laughs to be handed on this adventure. And as this is Pixar, the film also holds a fair share of touching moments, though it never reaches the level of being a tear-jerker like 'Up' or the 'Toy Story' series.
While we witness the return of our characters from the original entry (some of which are reserved for a post-credits scene), we also encounter a range of some new colorful characters along the way. First of which is Hank the Red Octupus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) who becomes a faithful companion for Dory on her wild adventure through the aquarium. Similarly to Dory, he provides a good share of laughter throughout his time on screen. Then there is some childhood friends of Dory including Destiny (voiced by Kaitlin Olsen) the Whale Shark and Bailey (voiced by Ty Burrell) the Beluga Whale who both become helping hands along the way. Idris Alba and Dominic West both provide the voices of sea lions who have a few good laughs but spend most of their time lying on a rock while hogging from a another sea lion in a comedic competition (they are not much help). Becky, a black-furred bird and piercing red eyes who doesn't provide much dialogue other than a series of loud squawks but also slips a few laughs for the kiddies. Each and every one the characters here are vastly likable and the film makes a rare surprise to providing a story without the presence of an actual villain (at least not in character form. With all great intentions, it works astoundingly well. And who can forget about the photo-realistic computer animation used to bring both the world and the characters to life.
Finding Dory is a heartwarming animated adventure that delivers a surprisingly touching continuation to Pixar's classic 2003 original. This film is a joyful sure to please both children and adults alike. Predictably so, it may be not endure as memorably as it's predecessor. Regardless, it doesn't have to be. Anyone who enjoyed the previous film is almost guaranteed to enjoy this one without a single noticeable flaw.""Adam McKay offers a different perspective with regards to telling a true story. He provides us with frequent Fourth Wall breaks and cameo appearances to help us the audience understand very specific terminology, as well as analogies which also provides the film with an educational undertone to it. Standout performances from the main 4 ensemble cast, who all create interesting and memorable characters. After watching this picture it will leave you feeling cynical and judgemental to anyone who associates themselves with finance. Overall, The Big Short is a very specific true story that doesn't try to hide anything from you and instead gives you true emotions and attitudes towards a nationwide financial meltdown, with the only regret being the re-watch value to the film as you can't bring yourself to watch a powerful depiction of corruption and greed more than once."Your Name or Kimi no na wa in Japanese is a anime movie directed by Makoto Shinkai is probably one of the most epic love love story ever told in anime form i ever see.After hearing how much critic and media love this movie and say this is the best anime movie since Hayao Miyazaki era as an hardcore anime fan myself i am really exited to check this movie out when it hit my country theater.This is a very beautiful anime movie with each scene is a jaws dropping animations and a beautiful movie score that fit the mood of the movie perfectly.The character is very likable and i find myself investigate more into the side character and the environment not just the two main character.The movie balance the comedy and the emotion very well that when something really sad or really fun happen the audience can feel the same way as the character.Is this the best anime movie ever ? Who know but for the coming of age like i am this is a truly beautiful fun emotion ride and i can see people will talk a lot about this movie just like they did with Spirited Away when it first came out"I did not have very high expectations from this movie before watching it, as many popular and famous films turn out to be not as good as claimed by their fans. But Shining actually turned out to be as good as most viewers has described it. This is not one of the scariest movies but it still has very unique and eerie atmosphere which it maintains through out the whole duration of the movie. Performances of everyone are quite good, especially that of Jack Nicholson. I also have to praise the performances of two actors Joe Turkel & Philip Stone who played relatively minor roles but both stole their respective scenes through their awesome acting. Script of the film is just fantastic. There are so many powerful scenes that give a highly creepy vibe without the use of excessive blood or gore. This movie can work as both a psychological horror as well as supernatural thriller. Overall, this is a masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick. I wish he had made more horror movies.
In the end, I would say, as long as you are not expecting a lot of gore, this is a must watch for every horror fan.""recently, a new hit movie came out called Star Wars to much praise. It even won six Oscars this year! Wow! So I decided to analyze the movie and find any hidden messages, and what I found is one of the most shocking right wing propaganda pieces in decades!
My main piece of evidence is the use of so many white actors. Never before has the term white washing seemed so necessary. The fact that white people are in this lighthearted fantasy film is racist. Of course, there is one black character-Darth Vader! The most evil character is the only black character? Actual KKK propaganda. Lucas' main inspiration was not Kurosawa, it was D.W. Griffith!
Perhaps if this film was featuring an all female or all black cast i would be more accepting, because those groups are superior to all white men. Now if you think that I am racist and/or sexist because I think certain races and genders are superior, you must be mistaken, for you can only be racist or sexist if you think that white men are better. There are no alternatives.
The so called Empire was used to symbolize Black Lives Matter. ""But Black Lives Matter wasn't a group back in 1977"" my opposers may whine. That does not matter, because reason. Anyway, the Rebels are supposed to be the KKK. Essentially, this film works as a remake of ""The Birth of a Nation"", but much more subtle and loud.
Many other groups are targeted as well. Muslims can also be used to represent the Empire, since they're mindless killing machines. However, although muslims are normally far more racist, sexist, and violent than most of their opposers, they are still good because they are a minority, and all minorities are better, especially black women who have been shot. It also insults the Jews blatantly with the Jawas, because just like Jews in real life, the jawas are short, greedy, cruel, and hard to verbally understand or communicate with. This hardcore realism is offensive towards the Jews, who I only care about because of the holocaust.
This is also an extremely sexist movie, because Princess Leia, the main female character, is not the main male character! WTF!
Also, it's homophobic even though I don't know why. I'll just rely on buzzfeed to finally write their article entitled ""10 Ways Star Wars is Secretly Right Wing Propaganda"" that I suggested in an email last Thursday.
I could get into even more detail about this offensive cluster of offensive, for example all of the pro-Christian, pro-NRA, and pro-freedom of speech trash. Dressing up as Darth Vader on Halloween is equivalent to dressing up in a KKK uniform. Once some monster decided to dress up as such on my college campus, so me and my safe space had to contact the school, and, guess what, they said it wasn't a big deal in a calm and understanding way! Since they acted so civil and gave good arguments, my safe space decided it was best to hit them and yell at them, calling them racist for allowing Halloween costumes.
Just kidding (obviously) this is one of the greatest films of all time, it's just so popular that I couldn't come up with anything new to say about it.
Also I would like to note that nothing in this review was intended to be obscene or overly offensive or anything like that. It's just simple satire of extreme political correctness. Personally, I have always been very left wing, which is why I really want to focus on satirizing and criticizing some of its modern day problems. This review was mostly a joke, so now I'll try to legitimately review the movie below, I guess, just so anyone whose curious and hasn't seen it can hear an actual opinion that isn't all sarcasm:
""Star Wars"" is possibly the most iconic and popular movie of all time, and there's plenty of reasons why. It is an engaging and entertaining fairy tale set in outer space that is jam packed with memorable characters, scenes, and settings. It is a exciting, funny, tragic, and entertaining. A true masterpiece of cinema, especially in its use of visuals as well as enjoyable storytelling. This is among the most fun movies ever made, as well as the greatest. As a matter of fact, I like this movie even more than the highly acclaimed classic ""The Empire Strikes Back""! So, please, I beg anyone who hasn't seen it at all, or in a long time, to go and watch it I'm indie toy, because it is unbelievably fantastical!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"" is a classic, there is no denying, a movie that people should still see 100 years from now and a lot of this is due to Daniel Day-Lewis' mesmerizing performance during these 2.5 hours. It's not a problem at all that none of the other actors in here are known really. For Dano, it was a bit of a breakthrough film, even if opinions differ about his turn here. It is possibly Day-Lewis' career-defining performance and every scene with him is mesmerizing to watch, especially in the second half when every scene is a winner, also contents-wise and it doesn't matter if we are talking about the restaurant/pub scenes, the ones with his brother, the final scene with his son (including the confession), the milk shake scene or eventually the grand finale. One amazing sequence after the next. And while I do think that Day-Lewis is the best thing about the movie, I still think it should have won more Oscars, but ""No Country for Old Men"" is pretty great too, so I can bear with it.
In terms of the subjects here, it is what you'd expect for a 2-hour film. It is never boring because there is so much in it, in terms of quantity as well as quality. God/Religion is a recurring theme, but it is also about much more personal issues, like fatherhood, family and a general sense of belonging. It's also interesting how love or sexual relationships are missing entirely in terms of Plainview's character. Another thing that should definitely be mentioned is the visual side. A movie about the early 20th century could hardly look any better in terms of cinematography etc. This film here is a true experience. I think it may be an even better watch if you don't know about the contents and what happens on several occasions, also especially the scenes where Plainview proves a ruthless criminal, but it's still really good on re-watch. It's possible to write 10,000 word examination on the character of Daniel Plainview (probably more as he is still a contender for most memorable film character of the 21st century) and the story itself as well, or even about his relationship with his son, about the initial motivation to take him and how his perception may have changed, the moment when he leaves his son when he needs him the most to run to the derrick for example. But there are many many other scenes to be honest and you will recognize them if you see them. This film is an experience that you have to make yourself and while I am usually more interested in the historic context of 20th century films that take place a little later, this film is evidence how I can also appreciate a work from very early 20th century, even if admittedly politics don't play a role in here at all and the time is pretty irrelevant if we neglect the professional background of DDL's character here.
So overall, this film is one of the rare occasions of the 21st century where I am not shy of using the term masterpiece. PTA and DDL are masters of their craft and they prove that they are among the very best existing right now in their respective fields. My description of this review already sums up perfectly how I see it and yes it is a must-see, even for people with not much of an interest in the admittedly sterile and bleak subjects of oil production and very early 20th century life, maybe also because it is only in theory about these topics. It is much more a character study, a biopic of what greed can do to you and how it can go against values like family, religion and sense of belonging if you make the wrong decisions because of your emotional state and because of who you are. Daniel Day-Lewis hits all the right notes here and even nails the scenes that could easily have gone over the top in bad way. Go see it now. What are you waiting for. A 150-minute movie (or even slightly longer) that never drags, you don't get that really often, do you?""Excellent movie, one of the best I have seen during last year and one of the best about Civil War period. Period. Yes, I am a Civil War buff and yes, I am trying to be objective here, but see, there are many films about the War and no, not all of them are good. This one, made by Gary Ross in 2016 and starring Matthew McConaughey as Newton Knight, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Rachel Knight, Keri Russell as Serena Knight, and Mahershala Ali as Moses Washington among others, this period piece is a Masterpiece. Its skilled change of pace, balancing between fast, brutally bloody battle scenes and slow, pastoral peaceful moments is a great achievement, and it all is beautifully backed by perfect Mississippi nature. Matthew McConaughey is superb here, he is the driving force and he shines all throughout the movie, with his masterful strokes and subdued muted passion that is still vivid and awesome. This shows how great Matthew is an actor and how well he can deliver pain, valor, vigor and tension with few words and few moves. Awesome work, 10 out of 10 and yes - highly Recommended""I did not have the luxury of seeing this in my youth, but I did watch it in early adulthood out of curiosity and my memories of that experience were worth rating it 6 out of 10. However, after watching a review of the movie by James Rolfe, I was inspired to watch it again and set aside my prejudices stemming from the notorious reputation of badness this movie drags behind it. It was an eye-opening experience.
Super Mario Bros. is a very good movie that became scorned in the public eye because of its association with the video game of the same title and being essentially the first major motion picture based on a video game. It also had the misfortune of being preceded by the Super Mario Bros. Super Show which has a very different format and probably set up a lot of unfair expectations as to what a Mario movie would be like. If we examine the Super Mario Bros. video game with the lens of a person craving a story, we find that there isn't much to go on. The plot is ""a plumber saves a princess from a reptilian monster in a castle"" and that's it. There are precious few details beyond that. The various enemies and objects and characters only exist for the purpose of enabling the game mechanics to function. Everything in the video game lacks any sort of deeper meaning; the only unifying elements (and I use that term somewhat loosely) are mushrooms, turtles, and pipes. What else could you expect from an 8-bit era platforming game? My point is this: as an inspiration for a full-blown story, the video game is effectively a one-sentence writing prompt. It shouldn't be a surprise that a Super Mario Bros. live-action movie is based largely on interpretation of the vague elements offered up in the video game. For the rest of the review, let's set aside the video game and focus on the movie as an independent work.
Super Mario Bros. has all the elements of a great family-friendly action/fantasy movie. Two everyday normal guys trying to make a living stumble into events that toss up their normal lives and they wind up in a dystopian place. There are elements of sci-fi and film noir that are executed very well, but the film also never takes itself too seriously and the comedy is always around to lighten things up. In a lot of ways, this film is reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a work that is arguably one of the best movies ever made. There are obvious inspirations from other classics such as Blade Runner and Mad Max.
It's not without its flaws, of course. There are some dull or just plain stupid moments that could have been cut down or omitted. Luigi's character sometimes acts in ways that have no believable motivation for doing so, even by the loose standards of a fantasy story in a family film. There are a lot of interesting elements that go unexplained which is a bit disappointing. There is a large set of people that are supposed to be vastly different but really just look like plain old humans in tasteless outfits and funny hairstyles (I can't explain in any more detail without spoilers but you'll know who I'm referencing when you get there) which is even more ridiculous because there is yet another closely related set of people that DO actually look different.
Fortunately, the flaws don't detract very much from the overall enjoyment of the film. It's actually a lot of fun to look for the references to the elements from the video game; some are in-your-face obvious while some are subtle enough that you probably won't catch them the first time you watch the movie.
I was surprised by this ""bad movie."" It was a lot more fun to watch than its reputation would have us all believe. If it hadn't been tied to such a vague video game and had to follow in the footsteps of the Super Show, this could have easily become a classic family film from the early 1990s. Many other reviewers claim to have enjoyed it in spite of its reputation and I'm happy to join them.""There are a number of similarities between David Cronenberg and Stephen King. They both created fictional scientific phenomenons out of thin air for their respective stories. Their respective stories tend to be suspended in the area where they certainly flirt with the supernatural elements, but for the most part remain planted in reality. 'The Dead Zone' involves these two creative heads coming together.
Christopher Walken plays the character of Johnny Smith who meets with an accident that forces him to slip into a state of coma for five years. When he wakes up, his life has changed, but he also discovers he has superpowers. The character of Johnny, certainly has a Christ figure vibe to it. This certainly is a morality tale to a great extent. Johnny constantly gets faced with dilemmas regarding how to use the power that he has been 'blessed' with. He becomes the rage of the town when people become familiar with his powers. Although initially he feels bitter about having his life destroyed, he decides to help others with his powers. To a great extent this decision has its roots in his sorrow of having his life altered by an act of fate which makes him want to change other's lives for the better.
The film is episodic in nature. The film is divided into sections which might seem unrelated, but clearly the structure is intentional as subtle elements in every episode leads to the next one. I had some problems with the way the character of Sarah gets used. Other than the opening of the film, she just appears here and there in the film, but to be honest, she remains more of a symbol than a real character. Now an argument can be made that this was the intention in the first place, but there is a crucial moment in the film where Sarah makes a big life decision, but Cronenberg to a great extent brushes over it. He should have devoted a little more time to that moment. The character of Greg Stillson also gets a bit of a rushed treatment(unlike Stephen King's book), which is a weakness too, but I guess one has to consider the time constraints in terms of making a film narrative too.
When it comes to acting, Walken pretty much carries the film on his own with a very emotive performance. We feel his frustration, his anger and his dilemmas. He brilliantly portrays the character of an introvert who feels frustrated and slowly distances himself from the world due to circumstances beyond his control.
Cronenberg's direction if compared to the films with his own screenplays is actually very understated. Apart from one or two moments of brutal violence, the quintessential Cronenbergian moments of body horror are in short supply. The film is shot brilliantly. There is a scene in a tunnel and the shot reminded me very of a similar shot in 'The Third Man'. Apart from some rushed treatment of Sarah and Greg, Cronenberg does well to deal with hardcore character moments which can't really be said about some of his films prior to 'The Dead Zone'.
I don't think 'The Dead Zone' is a perfect film, neither is it Cronenberg's best film. However it is a solid, grounded film with elements of sci-fi and horror. It has the Christ figure of Johnny Smith at the center of it whose character is compelling and layered enough to make the film itself compelling.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** While I'm not a big TMNT fan, I'm glad I watched this film. It's hard to pull off good turtle costumes, but the creative team made a very smart decision in having Jim Henson and his costume company design them. They look great, and the actors move very well in them. This film actually makes me want to look at mutated turtles just because the costumes are so amazing to look at, and that's hard to pull off. Splinter also looks really cool, and I'm surprised they pulled him off as well as they did. But aside from that, the fight scenes are really fun and are pretty entertaining. I mean, more entertaining than the superhero films we get these days. The turtles do what most teenagers do. They make pop-culture references, tell horrible jokes, and even curse. But there's a strange likability to them. They have a fun spirit to them even when in perilous situations, and look out for each other. Splinter is also very noble and dignified, defeating the almighty Shredder at the end and being full of good morals. I like the B-movie feel to this. I like films with a campy tone, and TMNT is a lot of fun to watch. The human performers also put a lot a lot of enjoyment into their performances, and the film can even be kind of edgy at times with the delinquents and mild cursing. But that's what makes it an entertaining flick. It's also a very hard adaptation to pull off, and while it definitely has problems with it's thin narrative and lame humor, it has a lot of effort thrown into it, and the result is something likable, fun, and entertaining. Check out TMNT if you haven't already. It's worth viewing.""Excuse the silly pun but I've just re-watched INSIDE OUT (DVD release) and I want to watch it over and over again, the way kids do
The movie is set in an usual place for a cartoon; there is no magic, no princess, no evil monster, no singing (!!).
You start thinking that one character is the lead or more important than the others, and end up realizing that they are all interdependent, more closely knit than you expected; they only work well when counterbalanced by one another.
Don't google the plot, let yourself be charmed and pleasantly surprised

Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill was of course originally intended to be one movie, but it was quite frankly far too long at 4 plus hours. So he made the decision to split it into two released a few months apart, with Volume 1 being the more off the wall, stylish action flick as well as a homage to the classic Kung-Fu movies of the 70's and Volume 2 being the more character driven.
This does create a slight problem of Volume 1 seeming to be not much more than a stylish revenge thriller on first viewing, but man, even if Volume 2 hadn't added much more substance, this movie is still perfect entertainment.
Tarantino always delivers with these types of homage movies (See Django Unchained as another example), because it is quite clear the man has a passionate love for cinema. And his love for the martial arts genre shines in every frame of this movie, which helps the audience into enjoying it more.
As such, I'll save my lavish praise for these film's merits as a story for my Volume 2 review. For this, I'll just rave about how enjoyable to watch this movie is from beginning to end.
The film just contains several wonderful sequences that I challenge you not to love, such as: - The entire opening sequence with Vernita Green and her daughter - The origin of O-Ren Ishii (done in the style of anime) - The Bride Vs The Crazy 88's - The Bride Vs Ishii - The cliffhanger ending All of which are filmed, acted and stylised wonderfully.
Adding to that, the film contains some of Tarantino's best, and, in some cases his funniest, dialogue: ""My name is Buck, and I'm here to f**k"", ""This is me at my most masochistic"", ""If on your journey you encounter God, God will be cut"", ""The price you pay for bringing up my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is I collect your f""If you want a movie that is entertaining, funny, action-packed with twists and turns throughout - then this movie is for you! The animation quality is as good as any out there.
The voice actors are sensational. Kelsey Grammar and Andy Samberg and their back and forth bantering is totally brilliant and any of us involved in business can understand the dynamic and completely understand the humour.
It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and never get bored.
Kids love it and there is plenty of content to keep adults laughing.
This movie is a terrific and I can't understand how anyone could not thoroughly enjoy this movie!""This was clearly written, acted, and directed by people who really understand the subtle shades of emotion. ""Inside Out"" ranks alongside ""Up"" for beautiful, intelligent story-telling.
The comedy is well-done, providing plenty of laughs without overwhelming the story, so the film stands up to repeated viewing. Fair warning: if you go in expecting laugh-a-minute, mindless slapstick, then you'll probably be disappointed. But if you are willing to acknowledge Sadness, you will be rewarded with a story that stays with you long after the credits are finished.
TL;DR? Ignore the haters, and enjoy being turned inside out.""At the time of this writing, Disney-Pixar's Up has received a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes. That means that 98% of the nation's movie critics have given it the ""thumbs up."" Such a high rating almost never happens.
That said, any movie, no matter how great, can be over-hyped, which can ruin the experience. For example, Ratatouille received such acclaim that my initial viewing of it was met with disappointment (though I appreciated it much, much more the second time around). So, in the interest of not raising the bar too high, I will simply say that Up continues Pixar's streak of excellence.
Combining poignant and profound themes with memorable characters and a contagious sense of adventure is par for the course for the group that brought us Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, and Wall-E. What do all these films have in common? They effectively tap into our childlike sense of wonder while never insulting our intelligence or emotional maturity (or that of children, for that matter).
Likewise, Pixar makes the most visually stunning and sharply humorous films of anyone doing animation right now. In fact, they make some of the best films, period. Up is no exception, and it ranks particularly high on my Pixar list because it did something the others didn't. It made me cry. Twice. Up got me going, with a pair of wordless moments (one towards the beginning, the other towards the end) that drive home how precious of a gift our lives are, as well as the people in them.
Don't worry, though, the movie is more of an adventure-comedy than a tearjerker. It simply has a beating heart, as the best adventures (and often the best comedies) do. It's thrilling. It's funny. For some reason I felt it dragged very slightly in the middle before kicking into high gear for the third act, but that's a minor complaint for something so thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Oh, by the way, I wanted to take Doug (the dog) home with me. You will too. MY GRADE: A.""I have to say that after watching many unfunny movies in 2016, I actually enjoyed this one. There were some moments where I LOL. Ones I remember right now are: - The 3 Sum seen with David Spade - The parts where Nick Swardson gets hit with the car - The part where the Biker guy flirts with Adam Sandler.
and many other scenes.
I've always been a fan of Adam's movies. Some of them were not as good as I expected, but most of them are well made and funny. As far as i remember, my favorite Adam Sandler's movies are when Rob Schneider is co-starring in them. Those two have chemistry.
I give this one 8/10.""It's widely regarded that Guy Ritchie's first film, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is pretty much a classic modern British gangster film. Therefore, much was riding on the  er  'sequel', simply titled 'Snatch.' Now, first of all, it's not a sequel, although some people may think it felt like one.
Alternatively, if you're feeling even less charitable, you could even call it a 'remake' (or 'soft reboot' as has been used post 'The Force Awakens'). Because, even die-hard fans (of which I confess to being one) have to admit that it's basically the same story as Lock Stock, with basically the same characters, shot in basically the same style. Only with Brad Pitt thrown in there (and he's awesome).
So, despite a fair amount of cynicism associated with Snatch, it's actually pretty damn good. Yes, it is a slight copy of Lock Stock, but, when a film was so perfect as Lock Stock, it's difficult to hate anything that replicates it so well. To use another term, Snatch feels like it's set in a 'shared universe' (only with gangsters instead of Robert Downey Jr).
The characters, despite most being copies of its filmic predecessor, are still pretty memorable  despite Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham playing almost the same roles as before and the evil mob boss not really straying far from type, we also get a trio of hapless pawn store owners, a Russian hit man who just won't die and Brad Pitt. Did I mention he's in it? Brad Pitt is the standout for me. Too many times he's been written off as a pretty face only, but (as with 'Kalifornia') he proves that he's as good at acting as he is looking (and I sort of hate him for that, but still...). He steals every scene he's in as the hard-as-nails gypsy bare-knuckle boxer and has everything from the mannerisms to the accent down perfectly.
If you like gangster films of any nationality then you have to watch Snatch. Yes, it may not be quite as original as Lock Stock, but it's still worth a place in anyone's DVD collection.
Pity about 'Revolver' though. Don't know what happened there.""I try not give any spoilers but some sentences might explain things. I will never ruin your amusement of watching this work of art with my humble comments. but still you have been warned.
... the village and the people the way they live where they live, not familiar but not strange at the same time. The cop and the people and the stranger and the girl nobody understands what is happening including us but I guess we suppose not to ...
I have enjoyed nearly the %85 of the movie. Some scenes made me think also. It is satisfying to have this kind of simple-but-deep, modern-but-traditional work of art.
p.s. try to imagine yourself that your are one of the villagers lives with the family and imagine at the end of every day you go back to your house across the street with fear and questions and survive the other day.
only then you might feel the suspense and the fear at your very bones.""If you only do what you can, you will never be more than you are now. Its an honor to work for a movie as great as KFP3. DreamWorks did an awesome job. Must watch movie. Best animation till date. Kung Fu Panda has always been my favorite franchise of all time. Looking forward for a 4th edition of this epic Title, As master Shifu says, Time is just an illusion, there is only the now. Talking about the villain, Kai has return! I guess Kai was the best ever character villain. Way to go Dreamworks!!! Love the Po character given to me as a souvenir for working on this. As Po says, Listen closely because I'm only going to repeat this ten times.""Just finished this movie for the first time and I am angry at myself for waiting so long to see this film. Hugo is a film made for movie lovers like me. When people talk about magic in film this is what they mean. This film is pure movie magic. You get great performances from Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz and Sacha Baron Cohen but the stand out performance is Ben Kingsley. But don't let that fool you because the true star of this film is Martin Scorsese with his directing. You can tell Scorsese is a film lover and it comes off the screen so beautifully. Everything about this movie is great from the directing, acting, cinematography, and the score. This is film making at it's best. The only reason I didn't give it the 5/5 is because it is a little slow but don't let that stop you from seeing this unbelievable movie!""WILD STRAWBERRIES is a romantic drama that could cause some confusion and rebellion of the human spirit for the viewers. One very cold and realistic story about the differences in human emotions and aging is full of strange harmony. An aged professor of medicine examines his life while traveling to university where he taught for years in order to receive an honorable mention. His estranged daughter in law travels with him and the two of them visited many important places from his past.The Professor meets, on this journey,interesting people and they become part of his fantasy...
The atmosphere is grim and scenery is presented in the form of a beautiful wasteland. They are a kind of symbol of solitude, loneliness and leached life. However, the three youngest protagonists try to disturb this harmony. Young people are full of life, even if that life does not make sense.
Mr. Bergman has symbolically linked every appearance, details, events, things and objects together. He connects them in a life story. A certain conflict in the character is visible in this film. Youth, playfulness and innocence against old age, remorse and guilt.
Victor Sjöström as Professor Isak Borg is a cold and egoistic old man. Wild strawberries are a symbol of love in his youth. However, wild strawberries have chosen someone else. His story is real, touching and painful. He is a character who is admired, but never loved.
Ingrid Thulin as Marianne Borg is a woman who tries to understand the cold emotion. However, she yields under her own emotions. Gunnar Björnstrand as Evald Borg is an unwanted son and a ruthless husband. He rejected his life for no reason. However, he understands the difference between love and loneliness. Bibi Andersson as Sara is a playful girl who has two wooers. She will awaken deeply buried memories in an old man.
The story, perhaps, is not sufficiently simple and clear. Life is not simple. Redemption is not the point of this story. Life is strange and tortuous path between emptiness and self-realization. Some people manage to fill their emptiness with emotions. Some people fail. Understanding and reconciliation between the different characters are the point in this movie.
Mr. Bergman is a genius.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a wonderful movie with wonderful artwork that really brought back my childhood. You know those vibrant and colorful story books with pictures that your elementary school teachers use to read to the students. Well it's kind of like that except it's like watching a moving children's story book that even adults can enjoy and be mesmerized with. It's rare to see amazing 2D animation movies that isn't from japan, so this movie was a treat to sit through. This is a stunning and hand-drawn animated folk-lore journey. That encompasses the importance of understanding, bonding and how good intentions might not always be the right choice. This is a wonderful 2D animated movie I would recommend to kids and adults.
9/10""I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for ""colored"" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, ""Hidden Figures,"" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.
The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human ""computers"" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As ""colored"" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.
At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.
There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.""Beware. You might be ugly crying by the end of this one! It pulls on your heart strings from the very first scene in the film. The story weaves effortlessly back and forth between two people, telling a tale of star crossed love, a god of time and two of the most memorable characters I have seen in an Anime in a long time. The artistic direction leaves you feeling breathless at points with beautiful juxtiposition between the rural and city lifestyles the characters live in. The music score and direction in this film are key selling points, both beautiful and haunting. With key pieces placed in all the right places. I was glued to the edge of my seat the entire movie. I was never in a rush to get to the next scene, I just took it in, in all its glory and in the end it left me completely satisfied.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I love films and I watch films from all around the world - French, Japanese, Korean, Iranian, Spanish, British, American etc.
When you go and watch a film please watch with an open mind, don't relate it to your life. Karan Johar has a certain style which does come across his films. I haven't seen all of his films apart from Kuch Kuch Hota hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Ghem which were both well made films though if I had to rate those films I would rate 7-8/10. All others films I was bit disappointed but this film collaboration of Indian and Pakistani actors, story, acting, humour were up to the mark. I have read some reviews people comparing and saying ""He is Hollywood Wannabe"" 90 percent of Indian films are a copy of some Hollywood film, many of them are literally same setting, same scenes, same acting only badly done. I wouldn't say this film was entirely original but least it wasn't entirely a copy. It was funny, glamorous, heart breaking. Overall a very strong film. I was going to rate it 9 but people being unfair rating it 1-2. I am going to rate this film a 10.""This movie is one of the best movies I've seen on a really long time. I personally like the story of the movie and i actually like the end and I like the characters and how it evolve through the movie. And that's not all, the special effects in this movie are just spectacular, maybe is it because i love space but it is really good.
The music in this movie is on another level and it just makes the whole movie much more exciting to watch.
If i'm gonna come to an conclusion i would say that's the movie is one of the best and have a cool story that most people probably would like and if you haven't seen the movie already I would strongly recommend it for you.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A friend told me that I would be amused by this film, and I was!
It took me about a minute at the beginning to realize that I was going to be in for some deep satire, as the copy played by Simon Pegg works up the ladder of his superiors to find out that he's ""too good to be kept on staff because he makes everyone else look bad."" I had previously seen Pegg only in a Star Trek cameo, where his talents were wasted at the hands of JJ Abrams. Here, he shines.
As he is reassigned to a quaint British village, it slowly dawns on him that not all is as it seems, and that mysterious deaths are a grand collusion of the villagers. His sidekick is a naive but eager learner, and the two work of each other really well. The quips are hilarious.
The British villager characters are drawn wonderfully, even the little lady with her crossword puzzles is really a demonic killer. The plot proceeds from more of a cop mystery-and-detective story to outrageous action set pieces as we approach the climax.
In a way, the structure of this film is a little like Blues Brothers, an equally quirky movie: things start out reasonably normal, but by the end, things are so over-the-top that you're not quite sure where it transited from improbable to impossible.
I'll have to go see Shaun of the Dead now, even though the title did not sound very inspiring!""In the opinion of this reviewer, an extraordinary achievement.
The characters on which the film is based were special and unique on their own, and well deserving of the sort of semi-documentary films that Hollywood likes to serve up.
However, to take that story and bump it up to a major ""feel-good film"" that engages the viewer from the getgo and does not let up until the very end of its 2 hour and 5 minute running time, THAT is what elevates this project to greatness.
I want to be clear on this because it is important. There are two ways to do a feel-good film. One is (ironically!) by the numbers, using proved plot arcs and other script devices to make it work. An example of this for example is the latest Disney release MOANA which has taken some heat from critics for being derivative and not original. But that, you see, is the tried and true method to achieve the effect that the producers wanted. And it works.
The other way to make a film engaging and fun is to use your instincts and your actors to get the most from each scene. No rule book, no fixed way of doing a scene, just doing what works. This is, I believe the way that writer/director Theodore Melfi set out to do Hidden Figures, and boy did he pull it off! The acting is stellar. Costner has matured in his latest film roles and his work here is as far from the nonsense he used to do (like the dreaded Robin Hood) as the earth is from the sun.
Taraji P. Henson finally lands a great role, the kind of role she was looking for when she left the hit series Person of Interest a tad early.
And every good film or TV series needs a character who is ""the glue"" or a reference point that the viewer can use, like a compass needle, to see where we are in the main story. Here Octavia Spencer gives the performance of her life as that ""glue"" and helps the director to pace the film.
Highly recommended.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I just watched this film for the first time on Netflix today. I found this movie very confronting and at times horrific. I don't know a great deal about slavery in America in this time but I didn't realize it was so inhumane. Although this film is touching and one can really can sympathize with the main character the brutalities are horrific. The scene with the young girl 'Patsey' getting lashed was extremely hard to watch. It really puts life in these times into perspective, I can't imagine what people in those times must of endured. All in all the actors were amazing acting these parts and the movie was touching and definitely one that is hard to pull away even at the confronting parts. I had never seen the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor before but in this movie he was outstanding and he deserved the BAFTA award 100%.""Alan J. Pakula's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a movie that demands your attention, and fortunately for use we're sucked in involuntarily. Sure, with all the names that link to the McGuffin it does get somewhat confusing, but by the end you've sorted everything out. The film is structured like a Russian doll, you start with the largest piece of evidence and work your way down. The movie is shot like a documentary that was somehow cut to look like a suspense film. There are no personal subplots that get in the way, just straight information. It's clear that the writer was just aiming for the bare bones. In some ways it's episodic, but from what I know journalism is very episodic. The picture feels somewhat like straight-facts Andromeda Strain, minus the science fiction but plus the paranoia and determination. There are no moments of tension crafted in the editing room, although some of it can be accredited to that, it is straight drama depicted through the performances, which are incredible. When thinking that this and Network lost to Rocky for the Best Picture Oscar is frustrating.""by far one of the best works from Christopher Nolan. already had a great deal of respect for this guy and he never seizes to amaze us with his work. This truly is the best rendition of Cinematic Batman we can expect. Don't think anyone can come par to what Nolan has achieved with this franchise. Christian Bale does justice to the character we so love and admire. I think no one could have done a better Bane representation but Tom Hardy. This movie has all that we love about Batman series. The cool gadgets, batman's agility and his skills as the warrior in the shadows. This is the complete package and truly worthy of being the finale of the Nolan's Dark Knight.""Great for sound clips during informal meetings. Absolutely hilarious.. One of the best comedies ever. Mike Judge is a genius.

That is the word that comes to mind after watching AVP. With a cast this great and special effects pushing the boundaries of modern Cinema it is no wonder that this is considered one of the greatest works of art of all time. The plot is brilliant with writing rivaling only that of Shakespeare and Poe. Never before has the movie shaped human culture in such a way. This Timeless testimony to the triumphs of mankind will be remembered through the centuries. Everything about this wonderful work of art will leave you speechless stunned and begging for more. A rare movie that can be watched over and over again and there will always be something new that you can take with you on your journey through life and self- discovery."Turbo Kid is an instant classic in the making. I recommend this movie to anyone that's into retro action movies, mix with a lot of old fashion cartoons. It start at slow pace in the beginning when the kid (Munro Chambers) Scavenging in a post apocalypse wasteland collecting junk items trade into a buyer. later on as the movie progress we get to learn more about his character and the people he meet along the way. The thing I like about Turbo Kid is it's characters. All of the characters The Kid, Apple and Skeletron are easily memorable.
Skeletron(Edwin Wright) is a villain like Michael Myers, Jason, and leader face that doesn't utter a word just kills. The thing that separate Skeletron from those other villains is his humor; he so different an original villain of his own because the expression he gives a funny humor vibe killing his victims. Skeletron is a live action cartoon villain with humor base on his expression.
Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) is energetic, very lively, animated and active, but her character keeps progressing and you will see a lot of development in this character. She start to tone down her active status throughout the movie. You will start to learn more why she's that way if keep watching.
The movie start at slow pace in beginning but delivers in a lot of other areas which I enjoy. The main scenes I enjoy was the fight scenes (the pool party) and (the final battle) a lot of Gore and slicing which I find interestingly weird and creative in a unique way. I'm myself really not into Gore but once you keep watching the movie over and over again you find yourself getting use to it. I Also like that this movie had all the characters traveling on bikes the whole time.
I here a lot of people comparing Turbo Kid to a lot of 80s classic and Mad Max. I watch all those films and Turbo Kid is far different. I have to say Turbo Kid is more violent than Mad Max because the Gore. The first Mad Max had more romance than Turbo Kid; Turbo Kid is not a romance movie because Apple and The Kid was just friends; more like a buddy duo not much romance. Turbo Kid is all Sci-fi, action, adventure and a little fantasy.
Mad Max 1979 is action mix with romance. It show less adventure and sci-fi than Turbo Kid. Many Mad Max fans don't want to admit that it's less violent. Turbo Kid is way more creative and violent it's like retro mixture of cartoon violent for adults. The only problem Mad Max fans holding a grudge over Turbo Kid because it's more brutal than Mad Max with the Gore two completely different movies.
Mad Max 1979 is ashamed to include the romance genre because it's adults and young male audiences it tackled to but theirs way more romance in Mad Max then in Turbo kid. Turbo Kid doesn't really have romance because the friendship was shown more. Max character was to soften for the romance. Turbo Kid wasn't mocking anything from Mad Max or The 80s film. This movie has some originality of it's own. The only thing is the same is both set in post apocalypse wasteland.
Back to Turbo Kid I love Apple and the Kid friendship so cartoon and quirky; everything about this movie had some originality and creative. All the characters costumes designing was original and creative. Skeletron iron skull mask, saw blade was so different created for a character. The Kid and Apple first and second wardrobe costume was original and creative as well. The fight scenes shows a different form of originality from high budget action movies Turbo Kid separated itself from high budget movies by showing it's creative side during a fight scene. Like in the final battle we have body on body which was unique thinking about weird stuff happening in cartoons that's the vibe I get from that scene.
This movie had a lot of creativity behind it that separates from Mad Max 1979 and 80s classic. I never get why fans call action movies like marvel and dc masterpiece with no creative art in those film. As a artist you can call Turbo Kid and any indie film a masterpiece. It's a lot of different forms of art in this movie sci-fi, Gore artist; Some colorful mix with dark. When Kid blast the giant man (at the pool party) I say that was art with blood and guts. Some of these art you can see in art galleries, museums violent Gore painting. Some may not get a film like this because they never been into art.
In the movie I like the bond between Frederic and The Kid its like a father and son relationship that I hope continues. All the characters connects well throughout the movie it shows more when all three characters The Kid, Frederic and Apple work well together fighting off Zeus( Michael Ironside) and his crew. After watching this countless times; this movie earned the title as my new favorite movie. It's been a long time I felt this way because Turbo Kid really is something different that you can enjoy for yourself.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is so beautiful,from the eye-popping animation to it's plot is flawless.Hands down one of the best anime movie ever.People often overlook anime as action but this movie's love story better than any romeo-Juliet.The starting makes you involve it with a humor base story which eventually turns a twist that their body stop swapping because the girl who he swaps body actually died 3 years ago,I was wtf at the moment but it was covered quick with tears.Some things are unpractical but this makes the movie more beautiful, I assume the ending can never be perfect by saying "" your name "", filled with my tears. Ps:- This movie OST perfectly matches the movie which always moves you.""It starts with ""The Hritik"" and ends within you.. I assure you'll keep discussing it for days. Rohan a blind person played by Hritik has heightened senses (like all blinded person) and meets Supriya for marriage. He throws an unusually lovely proposal and you will get to know the completeness. Hritik takes you to the journey of a blind person's mind and you will be simply blown away by each frame. Every frame has a detail and every Character has a significance. Rohit and Ronit played most wicked villain like one of the most cunning hunters given equal opportunity. You will be stunned by the hard work of all the characters, Yami, Hritik, Rohit and Ronit are four pillars of movie. There are some scene where Ronit poured his anger in his eyes that's where I was mesmerized, couldn't took off. This movie can be enjoyed in cinema only not on a small screen. Go for it, unless you want to revisit a usual gangster story.""Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going for him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.
The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not do the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance sequence.
From that point on, the film is hypnotic.
We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.
Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful.
Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance, but he delivers the goods.
Stone, who was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" after Easy A (2010), steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The awards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.
As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film industry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they would film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at the last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending, along with the ""real"" ending, along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.
Destined to be a classic. Recommended.""My son dragged me to see this. I've gone with him to his comic book movies, his other zombie movies, and on and on. So I was set for one of those Dad-is- willing-to-give-up-a-day things. This utterly tongue in cheek masterpiece had me from the get-go. There are so many sight gags and pop culture references, so many goofy encounters, so much character to the undead, I really enjoyed this. I see now why it became a cult film because it is infinitely quotable and full of absurdities. It also has a really fine cinematic sense. I also loved what the role of the zombies is at the end of the picture. If one has ever worked with high school boys (or lazy male young adults), you will find a great deal to enjoy here. Really!!!""Quite the opposite of Avatar, my expectations were low for The Blind Side, a film whose trailer rubbed me the wrong way. I'm all for inspirational films, but this one looked like an overcooked, manipulative tearjerker with Sandra Bullock stepping way outside of her comfort zone to play a Good Samaritan Southern Belle who helps a struggling black teen with a painful past. I was afraid the film would exploit or gloss over the true pains of African-Americans struggling to escape the projects. I was afraid Sandra Bullock, whose forte is romantic comedies, would annoy with an attempt at a Southern accent. I was afraid that the power of this true story would be lost in hackneyed and trite film-making.
My fears were unfounded, and one cannot, it appears, judge a film by its trailer. This is one of the best mainstream films about Christians I've ever seen, possessing charm, integrity, and honesty in spades. Bullock's stab at a Southern accent, while dubious in a two-minute trailer, is actually quite convincing when viewed in the complete film. She truly loses herself in the role, and much to my surprise, I'd like to see her win an Oscar for her tough-love portrayal of a woman whose cannot help but help others. Country- music superstar Tim McGraw, as her husband, proves himself a capable actor, Granted, he doesn't have to do any heavy emotional lifting in the film, but his ability to deliver lines of dry humor was an unexpected delight. Newcomer Quinton Aaron, as the young man helped by Bullock's family, conveys a great deal of pain, sorrow, and joy with his eyes.""This movie have great cinematography a lot great shots in this film is so beautifully laid out. I love the pacing of the movie it's so realistic base on the aftermath of living and surviving in a post apocalypse wasteland.
Compared to Mad Max, Turbo Kid did it more realistic by the tone. They even had everyone riding on BMX bikes which I think makes more sense having no vehicles in a post apocalypse wasteland. Turbo Kid is a indie film mix with action and sci-fi I also like the dark and light tone in the setting of The Kid (Munro Chambers) scavenging in the post apocalypse wasteland for junk items and then later he meets a weird teenage girl Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) very animated and lively. She's has a mysterious backstory later on in the movie.
I recommend you give this movie a chance it's a whole lot different then a lot of Hollywood films. It's colorful,dark and the two lead actors Munro Chambers and Laurence Leboeuf did a fine job portraying they characters. I truly enjoy this movie. 10/10""This is a great movie. The story itself is an old folktale, also found in the King Arthur stories. So yes, you have to start from there and, yes, you do know how it will end. Having said that: Beautiful production, witty, intelligent, great acting, meaningful insights on life, family, and society. Great for a date, or for the family to watch together. (This wasn't long enough so adding more.) Another reviewer commented that the girl was not ugly enough, or really at all. Well true, that was a little silly, but film itself has limitations in what it can show. I should also mention that there are some great ""supporting actor"" performances here, sorry the one-eyed guy didn't get nominated for an Oscar. There is almost nothing that anyone will find objectionable, unless it's the girl (age 25) drinking a glass of beer for the first time in a bar, or maybe the guy's gambling problem. But once again, girls 10 and up and grown-ups will love this movie.""I was very impressed with this film. I really like Michael Cera as an actor and also the movies he has work on. I loved the edition of the film because it is original and different and off course very well done. The screenplay is awesome because first it starts normal and as it goes on there is a plot twist and then at the end you finally understand everything. Also the idea of them having a band, and the girl with rollers and changes of hair color. Each scene that came, things become weirder but in a very good sense, I loved it. Personally I recommend everyone to watch this movie; specially if you like color full details and originality.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was a very good film.
Christoph Waltz played his part as the lonely, territorial man with a higher level intelligence. As the film brings you sadness and as you watch this film you feel caught in the moment. As you imagine your self like his character. but this is also a tragedy, as I cried for the first time watching it. This is by far the best of Terry Gillian. Although, I showed this to my self assured 14 year old and she thought it was inappropriate. So I recommend this for an edgier crowd with maturity and sense. But it takes a few good watches of the film to understand the last twenty minutes of the film. I would watch it again but be cautious as it is not for the light heart ed.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is one of my favorite movies for the message it passes. The environment takes you to a peaceful and joyful place while you learn how to be happy and let happiness grow in your own heart. I think the garden is a metaphor for happiness. While they take care of that garden and its flowers and plants and let it come alive, the happiness comes back to that mansion and it spreads to the people around. The uncle wasn't even home for his son who grew up sick and couldn't even see the sunlight. Both of them learn how to be happy and forgive and how to love and live life fully. Anyway, it's a movie that everybody should watch specially on those sad days. It warms your heart.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is the first Marvel movie and, after of course Guardians of the Galaxy, definitely most entertaining one of all about 25 I've seen so far. Movie was theatrical disaster and won bunch of ""awards"" for worst movie, directing, acting, etc. Is it artistic masterpiece? Od course not. But it was not supposed to be. Movie title is Howard the Duck, what those people expected from the story about alien duck that saves the world from evil space demons...I enjoyed it very very much and I intend to watch it many more times. It may lack artistic value, but other Marvel blockbusters don't have it either. The only thing that rises them above this one is high budget and CGI. But while they have arrogantly pretentious, Howard is down to earth honest adaptation of the comic-book that does not pretend to be something it is not, which is two hours of cheerful action for comic-book fans.
8/10 (maybe even 9)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Resident Evil Apocalypse is a loose adaptation of the video game Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City, and/or a cross between Resident Evil 2 & Resident Evil: Nemesis.
Alice wakes up in the Raccoon City lab (that was referenced at the end of the first movie) and finds herself in an abandoned, post-apocalyptic city called Raccoon City. She meets several people along the way (some survivors, some spec-ops like the first movie) and they try to find a way out of the city together (the government is going to nuke Raccoon City to contain/kill the infected/the T-Virus). Towards the end of the movie, Alice must face a ""boss"" (like in the video games) called ""The Nemesis"". He is virtually indestructible; she finds out it is one of the people from the first movie (Michael) and he ends up sacrificing himself to save the group from a helicopter crash. The final scene reveals that a man named Doctor Isaacs cloned Alice (this will come into play in the next movie).
FINAL VERDICT: Unlike the first movie, this one was pretty accurate to the games (in my opinion); so...if you like action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls, or all of the above AND the Resident Evil games, you'll like this movie!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In my opinion, Super 8 is an underrated movie. The reason why I care about that, is because it's the movie that got me into movies. All of the actors gave good performances. The ones that stood out were the kid actors. Their dialogue felt natural, and they all had great chemistry with each other. The script felt like three good movies combined into one. You had the plot about the kids making a movie, the plot about the relationship developing between our two leads, and the plot about the mysterious events going on in the town. It was well-written and well-paced. In the end, I'm going to give Super a 10/10. It is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I highly recommend giving it a watch!""Since the Brothers Grimm penned their morbid fairy tales (and probably before), children and adults have escaped into fantasy to safely explore the dangers of reality. Tales such as Hansel and Gretel, and in the last century The Wizard of Oz, have provided imaginative worlds with dangers at every turn. The purpose of such tales was always to warn, educate, and provide a backdrop for moral instruction.
Such is true of Coraline, a cinematic fairy tale crafted by writer Neil Gaiman and director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas). Based on a book by Gaiman, this visually astounding stop-motion masterpiece is a reminder that not all fairy tales have wistful princesses and happy musical numbers (sorry, Disney). This is a return to the creepy morality tales of yore, and while young children may have nightmares from the unsettling mood and tone, older children and adults will likely delight in both its imagination and its message.
Coraline's title character is a plucky and resilient child (expertly voiced by Dakota Fanning) who has moved to a dusty, lonely old house in Washington with her parents. Both are neglectful in their own way: her father is caring enough, but is constantly aloof, while her mother (voiced by Teri Hatcher) is so busy that she hardly notices her daughter, and is often annoyed by her when she does.
One night, Coraline discovers a portal into a parallel existence: same house, same parents, but here everything is exactly as she wishes it were in reality. The dreariness of her true home is replaced by vibrant colors and spectacle. Her neglectful parents are replaced by updated versions who live only to lavish her with affection and wish-fulfillment. Soon Coraline begins to greatly prefer the alternate life to her actual one. It's all seems perfect, but she (and the audience) cannot shake the unsettling suspicion that something isn't quite right. Only a sage old black cat (who is realistically silent in the ""real world,"" but suavely vocal in other) seems to understand the dangers behind the seductive facade of Coraline's dream world.
To say more would be to ruin the surprises, but suffice to say that the film contains excellent messages for those who look for discussion points to share with their children afterward. The dream world serves as a perfect metaphor for the cunningly disguised lies of harmful people, as well their tactics of using subtle counterfeits to grant people's wishes in the short run, while slowly entangling (and later chaining) them in the long run.
As my mother always said: ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" With regards to Coraline's dream parents, they may be seen as a practical warning against slick strangers who might lure children away by promising them exactly what they want (much like the ""candy man"" character in Chitty Chitty Bang-Bang). The black cat, whose warnings initially go unheeded, may be seen to serve a similar purpose to parents, friends, and teachers. He is a wise, caring character who sees and understands things that the protagonist does not yet comprehend, tries to keep her from harm, and helps her when she is in peril.
Furthermore, the film not only reminds parents of the need to give their children attention and affection, but also helps children understand the stresses of parenting and the need for gratitude for the parents they do have.
In addition to serving as a lasting morality tale, Coraline is a terrific artistic achievement. While computer-generated animation is en vogue at the moment, the terrific and nearly seamless stop-motion animation here is something different and gorgeous to behold. The film is currently showing both in 3D and as a regular feature; I recommend that you see it in 3D if possible, as the richly designed sets and characters were meant to be experienced in that format. Far from a mere gimmick, the 3D in this case actually brings more life to the story, revealing layers and depth that were actually created by hand and filmed, one meticulous frame at a time.
Parents should be warned, that while the film contains no real violence, it is full of unsettling images and a creepy atmosphere that will doubtless give nightmares to little ones (much like the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz, though this is a good deal scarier). There is mild profanity. A scantily-dressed and buxom elderly woman, though a clay-animated figure and far from titillating, may be offensive to some. That said, for older kids, teens, and adults who possess rich imaginations and an appreciation for this type of film, Coraline is a terrific night at the movies, and worth the added fee to view in 3D.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The last scene of the movie... Batman:sometimes truth isn't good enough..sometimes people deserve more..and we see Alfred burning Rachel's letter.(this dialogue has two meanings..1)ofc people deserve more than the fact that at the end dent did fall into darkness...2)Alfred realizes that Bruce deserves more than a rejection from Rachel) Batman:sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded...and lucius destroys the sonar(again two meanings...1)people had faith in dent they trusted him to be the white knight so they need to be rewarded at any cost...they should not lose hope...2)lucius had faith in Bruce that he would destroy the machine and he is rewarded too) Gordon:(about dent)he is the hero Gotham needs but doesn't deserve(again..1)for Gotham they need dent because he was their hope...without him everything was lost and he died for them and the people of Gotham couldn't do anything to stop that so they never deserved such a hero like him...2)for Gordon...

Now to all those people who say this movie is not a masterpiece please state an ending line with such insight such darkness such thrills...and good like finding that....""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is really sad, like it shows the way people with different deformities were treated so badly. What was really shocking, was that the story goes that a dwarf man is in love with a beautiful French woman who is able bodied and is using the dwarf for his money. Even worse, she actually is getting jiggy with that world strongest man guy. Seriously, it is just seems so f*cked up and that does go to show how back then, the way they treated people with disabilities rotten.
I have to say, although the ending was brutal, it was a good revenge plan at the same time. I mean, she was cruel and deceitful to Hans especially trying to kill him with poison. I suppose maybe that scene considered this as a dangerous movie or the fact, it had disabled people on it. This is my first time ever watching a 1930s film that showed people with different needs. I just wish this film was receiving credit, the actors were brilliant and I'm giving this an 8/10!""There have been so many version of the Hunchback over the years. This animated one is one of a kind. It takes the basic story of Quasimodo and Esmerelda and the evils of the Cathedral and softens them. Quasimodo is made to look cute and cuddly, even though he is routinely abused. He is usually made so ugly, that he frightens people who meet him. Actually, the abuse is there all the time, from the townspeople to the clergy and on and on and on. When Esmerelda shows kindness toward the bell ringer, it does not have the edge that is in the other films. We don't get the sexual tension here and the longing of Quasimodo. This film is done well enough, but it suffers from a holding back that Disney Studios has to do to be marketable. While it doesn't measure up to a kind of golden period, but it's better than most animated films.""Saw it on a long flight, had never even heard of this movie before despite us watching anime and cartoon regularly. What happened there WB?? So I ended up seeing it more by coincidence - the same as many other adults on the 5 hour flight. And the plane was full of laughter. One of the most absurd and hilarious movies I've seen in a long time. It is very fast paced, lots of word play and verbal humor, slightly evil in touching all kinds of topics from career-nuts adults, over-ambition and sacrificing it all, bullying, casual nastiness to people. Delivered by a fast-talking, bright, very cheeky teen girl with a big heart and a stork trying to keep up and sorting it all into his very structure perspective on life. Go watch it!""This movie has the most original script and argument that I ever know. I feel very privileged while viewing this incredible piece. The quality of the cast is outstandingly good, the acting was perfect and full of emotion and pure energy. The early XX century, that clock that goes backwards, the New Orleans spirituality and esoteric atmosphere also help to build that positive arrangement for Benjamin's Button peculiar genetic case of aging in inverse. Besides that, the character live his life to the fullest, never feeling sorry for himself, never being depressive, angry, frustrated or upset by his biological father abandonment. Although his different condition in comparison with others, he finds true friendship and love with Daisy, a professional ballerina.
When they finally meet again, we enter in another stage of the film, when the plot is focused in the phase of more normality of Benjamin's life, where he finds Daisy in the same age point, and every feeling was evolved.""almost twenty five years since its release, and this movie has stayed in the top ten of every 'best' movie listing on the net. the acting is impeccable, camera-work is unsurpassable. casting was perfect, when i try to imagine any other actors in the roles, the movie just falls apart. Ben Kingsley as Itzhak stern, is a powerful and insightful character played with great humility and awareness. the actors experience of character acting makes this role a plausible, sympathetic role which he will forever own. coupling liam neeson and ralph fiennes, whom i consider less experienced actors of the day, worked supremely well, but led to the odd concept of a lesser actor being in the lead role and supported by a far more experienced and able actor, yet it worked perfectly.""It is the mid-1930s, the height of the Great Depression. Con men Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) and Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) team up to swindle crime lord Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), a man who wants Hooker dead. They assemble a team and hit upon a plan. What follows is complex and fraught with danger.
Superb movie - clever, engaging and entertaining. The sting itself is a sight to see, so complex and smart you can't stop concentrating for a moment.
Paul Newman and Robert Redford are perfectly cast in the lead roles. They had, four years earlier, teamed up for the excellent Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid and here they reproduce that confidence, swagger and camaraderie.
The Sting won the 1974 Best Picture Oscar.""BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic directed by Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra, starring Farhan Akthar and Sonam Kapoor
Based on the real life story of an awesome athlete ""The Flying Sikh"" Milkha Singh and his role played very well by Farhan Akhtar the multi talented person has put his heart and sole in the movie.
Farhan Akhtar's tough physical training for this role pays great dividends on screen. Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an award-winning film. It shows us the life of Milkha Singh through his very own eyes and deserves a standing ovation for its performances, writing and direction.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I really enjoyed this the second time round. The first time I was fairly Luke warm with it, which was at the actual theatre when it came out.
The world building was great, acting was super. Production values were great. His face modifications were pretty strange but the rest of the movie was on point. I liked the overarching story and the question posed. The answer to the question via him deciding to kill himself after they both finally found each other felt a bit self serving, but it makes for a dramatic story.
Overall, yeah - quite enjoyed it a second time round.""There Will Be Blood is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a sprawling (at two and half hours long) spectacle of a film, exploring the lives of two very different and yet very similar men at the turn of the twentieth century. Directed and written by Paul Thomas Anderson, this doesn't just tell a simple story and leave it there. Like oil drilling, Anderson slowly breaks the surface and then everything that was underneath comes out to see the sun in a massive spurt.
Starring Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, this was a phenomenal showcase for both leading men. But Lewis gave one of the best performances of all time as a sociopathic, charismatic, egocentric, and ultimately pathetic man. Truly mesmerising and formidable. The direction and screenplay was rich and dense, creating an entire world in only two separate places. The dialogue was always solid.
The score, led by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, is haunting and gorgeous, and sometimes juxtaposes the scenes it's in to remind the audience that while something may not seem exactly bad on screen, what is happening might lead to something awful later on. The cinematography is just exquisite.
An American epic of the twenty first century is the ultimate take away from this film. It's bold, ambitious, and perhaps obnoxious for some, but at the end of the day, it is a near perfect character analysis of someone most won't relate to at all, but someone we can't there eyes off. Rich visually and thematically, There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece.

Enter, Gordon (Edgerton) aka Gordo. A chance meeting in the furniture store happens when Gordo spots Simon and recognises him and introduces himself, Simon takes some memory jogging but gets there in the end. Something isn't quite right about Gordo.
Then the unexpected gifts and day time visits begin and Robyn, being too nice for her own good, repeatedly lets Gordo in. He's creepy but seemingly without malice until he spots Simon's less than charitable assessment of Gordo pinned to the fridge...
From this point on nice but harmless Gordo takes a sinister turn, though Robyn can't decide if it's all in her mind or not and Simon becomes increasingly determined that she shouldn't worry about Gordo and equally unwilling to shed light on what is meant by ""let bygones be bygones"" in Gordo's parting letter.
With seeming little else to do but run, drink sports drinks and keep house Robyn does some digging and uncovers what a shining example of a bully her husband once was and how a vile but baseless story from his past ruined Gordo's life.
Simon continues with his career and wins another promotion, Robyn gets pregnant and barring the non-materialising threat of Gordo lurking in the background all seems well until the guy who Simon quietly stiffed out of the promotion arrives mid-dinner party and reveals that Simon knows all his old tricks and is still quite happy to use them. Robyn chooses this moment to go into labour.
One birth later, Robyn drops the bombshell that she won't be returning with Simon, the revelations about her husband's character are too much for this new mum...as they are for his employer.
Newly unemployed Simon returns home to shower in preparation for his attempt to save his marriage where he is greeted by four new gifts each more chilling than the next...I've said enough.
The three main characters are excellently played, the script feels natural and the theme of moral duplicity leaves you with thoughts like; ""Poor Simon..but Karma's a bitch"", ""Poor Gordo...but you are a sick puppy!"" and ""Poor Robyn, she didn't deserve to get stuck in the middle of this!""
It kept us guessing, Gordo's revenge is both fiendish and a brutal and my fiancée pretty much crushed my fingers thanks to the almost constant tension the film builds.
Well worth a watch.""i saw a trailer a while ago and i am a huge fan of the director so my expectations where quite big...I consider Park Chan-Wook an amazing story teller with a strong point of you and respect to his characters. The amazing thing its that i was not disappointed! Unique story ,mysterious protagonist , romance, revenge and beauty. Anything someone is looking in a movie he will find here. i truly hope this movie will go for and be enjoyed by manny viewers..i must say that it contains a lot of one on one nude girl power but its only to tell the beautiful story between the girls! i read also that the movie its from a book ..i am so glad he made the adaption between two countries that share a past like Japan and Korea' I am very ignorant so after the movie i started to google about the real handmaiden there. over all grate picture ..frame after frame i never took my eyes off of it""''The Handmaiden'' is a mesmerizing period drama that convinces with a twisted story, gloomy settings, an atmospheric score, precise cinematography, profound characters and incredible acting performances. It consists of three parts, the first two leading to clever twists and the last one to a satisfactory conclusion that leaves no questions unanswered if you watch carefully. The story is set in Japanese-occupied Korea and tells the story of a thief's daughter who is collaborating with a clever crook in order to steal the inheritance of a rich Japanese lady living in seclusion with her perverted uncle. Telling you anything more would take away from the movie's brilliant storytelling.
The movie has a slow pace but develops a melancholic atmosphere right from the start with the very first scene until the final freeze frame. Despite a few necessary repetitions in the story due to a few shifts in perspective, the movie passed surprisingly quickly despite a running time of nearly two and a half hours.
The story is clever and emotional with its twists and turns. Some twists are hard to predict while others are easier to figure out and others again aren't directly revealed throughout the movie but they are all told carefully, elegantly and profoundly. This movie doesn't only stimulate your genitals and your heart but also your brain.
The film should only be watched by mature adults since it includes a lot of eroticism. The movie carefully contrasts cold sexual abuse and passionate romance in a balanced way. This isn't only done by performing credible sexual intercourse in front of the camera. This is also told through facial expressions, Quote: s from erotic novels and appropriate settings. While more conservative minds could be shocked, one should note that every single scene adds to the clever story and the depth of the characters. This movie doesn't include any sexual innuendo and no pornographic movie could even slightly achieve what this movie does. This is truly a lesson in eroticism performed by highly skilled actors and actresses and this combination makes this movie stand out.
In the end, the combination of intense emotions, profound eroticism and an intelligent story in a movie involving outstanding actors and actresses and directed by one of the world's best directors makes this one of the very best period dramas ever made in the history of cinema. Not only genre fans will adore this movie but any adult with a genuine interest in cinema should watch this contemporary masterpiece."*** This review may contain spoilers *** I love this movie. The plot is just my favorite how Spongebob and Patrick have to go to shell city to save mister Krabs and Bikini Bottom. Even after Spongebob feels betrayed by Mister Krabs because he doesn't get the job as manager he still takes the trek. My two favorite parts are when Pat and Sponge have believed they become men. And they go into the bottomless obis and breeze right past the monsters and not only do they make it past but they make it past while singing. Number one scene is probably when they finally get back from shell city with the crown and then to get the plankton's mind controlling buckets off of the city folks he performs the goofy goober song with a laser guitar and just goes straight ham."The saga of European colonization of the Americas is epic and dramatic in and of itself. The New World, by acclaimed auteur Terrence Malick tells the story of the English arrival at Virginia and the conflict between John Smith and his men and the native people led by Powhatan.
There is definitely a spiritual air to the work as with most of Malick's films, and the point of view seems to be from the position of the natives, as the cinematography is very awe-inspiring and dazzling giving a child-like experience to the viewer.
The fierce violence and seriousness of the interactions between the English and natives is interspersed with touching romance between John Smith and the princess Pocahontas. Malick's romantic side shines brightly and the lovers story takes off swiftly.
The identity of the characters is a key theme in the film, and with John Smith's capture by the natives and Pocahontas' conversion to Christianity, identities fluctuate to and fro with the underlying humanity of the characters providing a solid groundwork.
The film is excellent, and beautiful artistic interpretation of the events of the colonization of Early America. Fans of Malick will recognize his wild-angle shots and off-screen narration. Those not familiar with Malick will still enjoy this film as a solid work.""ww2 war film , where do i start.well here i go. AMAZING FANTASTIC AND SO BRUTAL .a real and i mean real depiction of war and its total lack of reverence of life except for 1 man and his total and unshakeable belief in his faith who has no problem laying down his life to save others but will not kill.can not describe how brave a man can be. mel Gibson done a perfect job all actors worthy of Oscars . if this is what you produce mel Gibson keep doing it excellent film. the graphically portrayal of war is hard to watch but so so real especially the effect of a bullet or a fused grenade .casting was great many spring to mind but casting of andrew garfied genius perfect. all were amazing. what a film left me smiling left me worried left me caring left me wondering great film . 10 rating from me""Tony and Margot are an unhappily married couple. She is incredibly wealthy and he decides to have her murdered in order to inherit her fortune. His plan is sound but things go awry...
Good murder-drama. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, so not a surprise. Very clever, yet water-tight, plot. Hitchcock's direction is spot-on, as always. Builds the tension, and doesn't let the movie drift.
Only negative is the acting of Ray Milland. His stiff-up-lipness is excruciatingly irritating. Was Cary Grant not available? I got the feeling Hitchcock wanted Cary Grant, couldn't get him, so got a lesser lookalike instead.""I have expressed a very emotional couple of hours with a lot of stress. The movie show you what an American soldier go through during his duty. The ending of the story isn't a mystery, it's obvious from the movie name and also from the beginning scene, the enjoyment of the movie is what really happened not how it ends.
Peter Berg managed to make us really feel what did the four soldier suffered in their mission, in late June 2005. You will even feel been inside from what happened to them. His picture was respectful and done well.
I have to talk about Mark Wahlberg who proves to me in every movie that he is a great actor with great talent.
I enjoyed my time watching this epic mission and feeling sorry from my deep heart.
My rating is 8.5/10/""An adventurous girl (Dakota Fanning) finds another world that is a strangely idealized version of her frustrating home, but it has sinister secrets.
Although I have only read a fraction of Gaiman's work, I think this really captures some of his themes. The focus on childhood being a fantastic age, and the idea of other worlds just beyond the horizon. Mix in the very appropriate Selick-style direction, and you get just the right feel.
I would also like to give a shout-out to John Linnell. Without knowing his involvement, I immediately recognized the voice and that made me love the film all that much more. If it is in fact true that They have more tracks that were never used, I do hope they see the light of day. They Might Be Giants is ridiculously prolific, and more often than not succeed in creating wonderful sounds.""This is a movie which perfectly captures your state of mind as you slowly awake from a dream. What you thought were true realities while you were asleep become increasingly fraudulent the more you process them logically and consciousness rears its head, paradoxically there still remains a sense of legitimacy to the situations and ideas that had manifested themselves in your mind so abrasively as you slept. On one plain the players, like chronic somnambulists, know they are in a game yet their bodies and minds continue to act and think in ways that they cannot predict or control. They give in to the confusion because it offers a break from conscious thinking and inhibitions and opens up previously unknown avenues of imagination. What at first seems incoherent in this movie becomes more and more believable as images, characters, phrases, etc repeat themselves in fragments that you slowly begin to recognize subconsciously. Everything starts to make vague sense yet you won't be able to put your umbilical cord on exactly what it is the dream (or your own unconscious mind) is trying to tell you. The story operates in the same way as the plot of a dream ,gliding from one situation to another seemingly at random you cannot remember exactly where you came from, how long you'd been there, or why you'd been there but you gain a sense of reverence for the places you've been and the people you've met because they all make strange cosmic sense to you, they embody all of your deepest fears and desires so honestly that you cannot help but be grateful to them. Forget any coherent message or intelligent thought when you experience this movie because they are unnecessary to dream with.
For maximum harmonic understanding, ingest a handful of dubiously obtained Armenian sleeping pills, hang upside down from the ceiling of your lair whilst double fisting two bloated goat stomachs full of your great grandmother's long-frozen/now-thawed bReaSt miLk.

Hiccup has been told by his father that it is time for him to take over as village chief; however he doesn't feel ready. He wants to continue mapping undiscovered parts of the world with the help of his dragon Toothless. On one such flight they find a burnt village; it is a village of dragon catchers who are working for Drago Bludvist who wants them for his dragon army. His father tells him that Drago is a violent warlord who poses an imminent threat; Hiccup believes that he can talk to Drago and persuade him to live in peace. While trying to find Drago he encounters the mysterious 'Dragon Rider' who turns out to be someone surprisingly close to him that everybody thought had died years before. She lives with dragons in their vast, remote nest. Astrid and Hiccup's other friends try to help him find Drago but are captured and soon Drago is attacking the dragon nest with tragic consequences. He then sets off to attack Berk; Hiccup and his friends will have their toughest struggle yet if they are to keep the world safe for both humans and dragons.
I enjoyed the original 'How to Train Your Dragon' far more than I expected so was very pleased that this sequel managed to live up to the original. While watching the original probably isn't absolutely essential I think one should try to watch it before this as it introduces the key characters and their situation; this would probably lose a lot of its depth without that prior knowledge. I was not surprised to read that director Dean DeBlois was inspired by 'The Empire Strikes Back' as this film is considerably darker than the original, especially in the middle section where a major character is killed. There are some clichés but that didn't bother me to much as the story was good. As before the animation is top notch; the many flight sequences are particularly spectacular. As well as action and tragedy there is of course a decent amount of comedy which is funny without being too goofy. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original and look forward to seeing the third film in the trilogy when in eventually gets made.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** THE WAILING starts off like a creepy police procedural (think MEMORIES OF MURDER), then reveals itself to be a Fright Film of The First Order. It's this low-key, down to earth approach to the subject(s) that makes the movie compelling. It's not only a Who Done It but a WHAT Did It, with echoes of MEMORIES OF MURDER, THE EXORCIST, and many an Asian Fright Film thrown into the mix. At two and a half hours, it may well be TOO involving for most Couch Potatoes, whose attention span(s) these days tend toward the Attention Deficit Disorder variety, thanks in no small part to prolonged exposure to Commercial programs (with their non-stop, constant interruptions, which undermine the Mood the better Fright Films tend toward) and, of course, video games. For Fright Film fans, THE WAILING is another must.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Well, after reading a summary of this film that actually makes it sound really messed up, a part of me really wanted to see it. Mind you, I'm not actually surprised that somebody has come up with such a summary for Finding Nemo because it is a Disney production, and Disney is known for turning some rather dubious films, and stories, into movies that are actually quite suitable for kids  take Cinderella for example, or Hercules (he's certainly not one of those people that a respectable woman would bring home to meet her parents). However, unless you actually read this interpretation of the film you probably wouldn't realise how messed up it sounds.
Anyway, Finding Nemo is about how a man's wife and family are murdered by a serial killer, and then whose only son, who happens to be disabled, is kidnapped. So the man, with the help of a friend who happens to suffer from an intellectual disability, must track down the kidnappers and free his son. Oh, I probably should also mention that the last words that were said to him were words of hate due to the man's over protective nature.
Okay, while it might not be obvious at first, as I have mentioned, that explanation of the film does actually make sense, and in a way it is quite good because it doesn't paint the world as being a nice and happy place full of nice and healthy people. In fact, with two of the main characters having serious disabilities, and overcoming those disabilities, does have a lot to teach children. In a way, one shouldn't let their disabilities get them down, but rather see them as a defining characteristic. However, this film also has a message for parents, and that is that sooner or later we are going to have to let our children go.
To a parent (and I don't speak on experience here since I have never had children, nor have I ever been married), losing one's children can be heart wrenching. In fact even losing a single child is heart wrenching, to the point that marriages have been destroyed over the death of a child. In a way a child is our progeny, that which we leave for the world, that which becomes our legacy. As such I can understand why parents would get over protective, but the problem is that when we are over protective of our children, our children don't actually know how to survive in the real world. In a way I am even wondering whether the 'softness' of our society has come about through over protectiveness, where parent-teacher nights go from being a dread for the kid to being dreadful for the teacher. In a way society has moved from a point where a child's failure has not come about due to the child failing to study, but rather through the teacher's failure to give the student good grades.
There were a couple of other things I loved about this film, in particular the seagulls. I have to admit that they really portrayed seagulls very, very well  being incredibly possessive and incredibly single minded. Where as pretty much all of the other animals we encounter come across as intelligent (particularly the sharks who are attempting to become vegetarian) the seagulls can only say one thing 'mine'. In a way they are the most animalistic of the animals, existing only to eat, and fighting amongst themselves for every scrap of food. Living so close to the ocean I have a lot of experience with seagulls, and there is a reason that they are called flying rats  because they are.
While I have to admit that I have grown out of children's movies somewhat, some of them are actually quite fun, and Finding Nemo was definitely one of them. Mind you, I still can't get it out of my mind that I have actually seen this film before, namely because there is so much about it that is familiar.""There's nothing wrong with loving your country. And apparently IMDb users are OK with that except when America does it. America is supposed to make a film bashing American government and it's people because that's what the anti America folks want to see. That's silly. This movie was fun and exciting. It hearkens back to old school one man wrecking crew take no crap style flick. Yeah it could be cheesy and cliché at times but that's part of what makes it such a fun flick. Let me throw you an example of what type of movie this was: There was a long gun battle in the main battle scene reminiscent of the Call of Duty video games. It was one of the coolest battle scenes I've seen in a while.
If you don't hate America you will likely really enjoy this movie. Don't let the haters deter you. Check it out. Happy I did.
8 out of 10 stars for entertainment value.""What shocks me about The Empire Strikes Back is that it only came 12th on the list of best films ever. Star Wars has gone far before in A New Hope and Revenge of the Sith but I do think that this is the greatest film... ever. Yes, IMDb rates The Shawshank Redemption, a film that I am too young to see, but I just hear Yoda now! And the big reveal at the end. To stick to Spoiler-Free, you will discover what it is yourself. If you watch 4 5 6 1 2 3, this is the first time you will meet Yoda, and when I watched this for the first time, I left thinking 'I must watch Return of the Jedi, I must watch Return of the Jedi,' and you will too.""After watching the trailer I got excited for watching the Storks movie and the promises where at least 'good fun'. Storks is undoubtedly funny and keeps up with the audience attention just enough in spite of an at par performance in pretty much all departments. Let me start by saying that I don't this film is a 10/10 but hopefully my rating will add to its overall rating. This is a best cartoon for family.
Stork Mountain was a place known for delivering babies and its employees are primarily storks, along with a few other birds. Their current CEO, a stork named Hunter (Kelsey Grammar), discontinued the baby delivering business, seeing more profit by having storks operate a parcel delivery service called Cornerstore.
Tulip (Katie Crown), having just turned 18 years old, is working to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, but they always backfire. Meanwhile Junior (Andy Samberg), Cornerstore's top delivery stork, is about to be promoted to boss of Cornerstore while Hunter is the boss of cornerstone now and he will be chairman of the board. Hunter demand Junior to fire Tulip but Junior cannot find the heart to fire Tulip due to her kindness and hard work, and he lies to her that she is being transferred to the mail room, instructing her to never leave her new office space.
Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner (Anton Starkman) feels lonely because his parents, Henry (Ty Burrell) and Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), are too busy to spend time with him and he want to have another brother. Nate Gardner found ad about old stork deliver baby and he writes a letter asking for a baby brother with ninja skills and sends it to Cornerstore. The letter makes its way to Tulip, who reluctantly leaves the mail room to put the letter in a slot just outside the room despite Junior's attempt to stop her, injury his wing in the process. To their surprise, a baby girl is created inside a metal container, whom they later name Diamond Destiny.
Junior agrees to secretly help deliver Diamond Destiny. As Junior's wing is broken, they use Tulip's flying machine for transportation. However, they crash into a frozen tundra and they met group of wolfs who leaders named Alpha (Keegan-Michael Key) and Beta (Jordan Peele). The two manage to save Diamond Destiny, whom the wolves have fallen in love with baby. At last, Junior, Tulip and baby diamond escape from group of wolfs.
Back at Cornerstore, a pigeon employee named Toady (Stephen Kramer Glickman) learns of Diamond Destiny's existence. Toady told Hunter about the baby then he promises to give Toady Junior's position as the boss as they scramble the coordinates Junior and Tulip have been following to mislead them to a different location. Junior is captured and tied up by Hunter and his cronies at the false location and they kidnap Diamond Destiny. While Tulip follow the Jasper to her lost family. However, Tulip comes to rescue Junior without having met her family and the two resend themselves back to Cornerstore. After fighting an army of penguins, Junior and Tulip are chased into the abandoned baby making room and start up the machine as a distraction. As thousands of babies are being made, Hunter angrily confronts Junior and Tulip with a large robotic machine, but Junior refuses to surrender Diamond Destiny with Hunter's re-offered promotion. With the infant's playfulness, Junior and Tulip are able to cause the machine along with Hunter to fall off the cliff elevating the collapsing Cornerstore.
Junior rallies the storks, as well as the other birds, to help deliver the babies to the families who wanted them including the Gardners, and Nate accepts having a sister when he realizes that she has the ninja skills he asked for in the letter. The storks, former employees of Cornerstore, and the wolf pack reunite Tulip with her expanded family, and she and Junior continue their job of delivering babies as co-bosses of Stork Mountain.""One of the best movies of 2016 for sure.There is a simplicity and originality in the film that stays with you hours after you've watched the movie. Alia Bhatt shines as an actress, giving yet another outstanding performance that leaves you speechless. She dives into her character with ease and conviction and ticks all the right boxes delivering an emotional performance.Can't wait to see more of her films soon.A genuine actor who is a superstar.And then there is King Khan. Shah Rukh Khan plays a perfect support both to on-screen kaira and off-screen alia in the role of Jehangir. It was very cool of Srk to do this film and we are left feeling even we need a mentor/guru like Jehangir. It's the chemistry between Alia and Srk that keeps the film moving and the audience involved.The soundtrack is brilliant.Good supporting actors and cinematography. Great work by writer-director Gauri Shinde. A must-watch for sure.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First-time crook Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Salvatore ""Sal"" Naturale (John Cazale), and Stevie (Gary Springer) attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve shortly after Sal pulls out his gun, and Sonny is forced to let him flee the scene. In the vault, Sonny discovers that he and Sal have arrived after the daily cash pickup, and only $1,100 in cash remains in the bank.
To compensate, Sonny takes a number of traveler's cheques, but his attempt to prevent the cheques from being traced by burning the bank's register in a trash can causes smoke to billow out the side of the building, alerting the business across the street to suspicious activities. Within minutes, the building is surrounded by the police. Unsure of what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage.""It's not because I'm Greek, honestly, it's not. Or maybe it is, maybe there's something ingrained, some sort of deeply-rooted, ethnic support thing going on, I don't know.
I choose to believe that it's because I haven't watched such a well-made black comedy in years.
Because deadpan sarcasm speaks to me on a fundamental, primitive level.
Because hyperrealism is a powerful medium that, when used in the right way, can successfully create a dream-layered utopia where logic diminishes into nothing but an unwelcome afterthought after it has graciously offered its place to a fantastical world of boundless possibilities. And this is what Lanthimos did for me  it broke down the social limits as I know them and challenged me to think, not farther, but deeper into my own being.
Ultimately, the Lobster is an understated, dystopian love story that effortlessly made me laugh out loud while staring in its fun-house mirror of distortions  a claim not many movies can boast to have cast upon me.
And more to the crucial point, it's the one bloody film I didn't find myself needing bloody subtitles to understand Colin bloody Farrell's insane bloody dialect.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When speaking about the greatest science fiction movies of all time Ridley Scott's Alien is a film that will come up in conversation and its very much deserving of such praise as this is a fantastically executed and atmospheric film that I truly found to be brilliant. For one this film looks fantastic, the interior design of the Nostromo is designed perfectly its not flashy or unbelievable but a realistic version of a space craft. The special effects are also perfect most likely (similarly to George Lucas with Star Wars) chose not to rely on them to much but instead use them sparingly using real life models to make it seem more realistic. The design of the titular Alien is also perfect, the design makes it look terrifying and imposing. The tension in this film is done perfectly due to Ridley Scott's masterful direction of this film made he made it very claustrophobic through long takes and wide shots that revealed to us just how little space there was for the characters to run. Also like the special effects he used the Alien itself sparingly we only really so it up close a few times which puts the viewer more in the shoes of the characters and makes the film all the more unpredictable. Another thing this will did very well was get out a truly fantastic central performance from Sigourney Weaver who is just cast to perfection in this film she's a strong and intelligent lead that is extremely likable and was the perfect conduit for the audience to experience the horror. There is never a moment from the first act on wards where the viewer feels completely safe and it made this film much more enjoyable. When such a menacing force such as the Alien in this film is built up its hard to make its eventual demise satisfying but this film did it, it was built up perfectly to the point where it seemed unlikely that the protagonists would succeed. However my biggest issue with the film is it's first act as while the slow pace worked for the second and third act in the beginning it did bore me and didn't grab my attention like the rest of the film did.
Alien is a fantastic film things done in this film have been repeated in countless other Sci Fi films to this date, it's got one of the most effective uses if atmosphere ever in a film, I loved the central character and there was never a point past the third act where I felt completely safe. The only real problem with the film was the beginning of the first act but beyond that this film has no other flaw.
87%/A-""The most original film of the year and one of the more original films of the last decade. Swiss Army Man turned a lot of people away with the weird juvenile humour consisting of farts, but I feel like those people who turned it off or left the theatre missed out on something special. Behind all the gas, the film deals with depression, humanity and what it feels like to be alive. Poignant themes in a film that isn't a afraid to make you laugh in the weirdest way possible.
Hank, played by Paul Dano, is marooned on an island and is literally about to hang himself when he sees a dead body wash ashore. He thinks nothing of it, until the body spasms and lets out numerous farts. The dead body, whom is later called Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe, comes alive, more or less. He's able to have conversations, perform miraculous tasks and gives Hank the courage to look inside himself and answer some deep questions.
This is my favourite Daniel Radcliffe performance, is that odd to say? He plays a corpse who farts, so he doesn't have to move around a lot and he is basically stone faced the whole film, yet he brings an innocent charm to the role. He questions what it means to be alive, what feeling of love hate and depression are. Hank tries his best to answer these questions, but he might not even know the answers himself. The two bond over a few ""Weekend At Bernie's"" style comedy bits, which have more meaning later on when more characters are introduced, specifically Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
The title Swiss Army Man is appropriate as Radcliffe is used for various tasks. Fresh water pours out of his mouth, karate-chop action figure style arm swing, projectile mouth firing mechanism, sparking flint by snapping his fingers, among other things. Hank uses Manny's unique ""powers"" to help him traverse the terrain. You have to ask yourself, can you suspend enough of your imagination to enjoy the oddity of this? I don't think the film is ever really concerned with if any of these events are really happening or not. Instead it wants you to focus on the friendship these two have and despite one of them being dead, it's one of the best relationships depicted on screen this year.
I know there are people out there who dislike the film, but count me in the camp of people who really responded to it. Who knew that film about a farting dead corpse would be one of the best of the year and one of the most honesty portrays of friendship. Swiss Army Man is a win and a watch for anyone wanting something unique in their movie going experience.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I loved this movie! I laughed the entire time. If you are am Austin Powers fan you will love the guru. It was similar in that the jokes were sexually charged but bedroom humor is always fun to watch as a couple. Teenagers will probably get the same amount of humor, enough to enjoy the feature. Although I have read some bad reviews, I think that they were probably a little squeamish to the type of humor, or in general needed to vent some steam and they just used the Guru as a target. Go get laid or find Jesus people! I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good date night movie, or as a movie to enjoy between the guys or girls. I am not endorsing sexual behavior in underage kids, but I do think it is something teenagers would enjoy as a slumber party movie or something. There is not actual nudity shown, although implied, and there are no sex scenes to speak of...well...there was that one time with the circus elephants... Enjoy the show!""Very rarely does a film make me think like this one did. The film is a grand representation of what a film could be artistically. There was a quite abstract theme to the entire film, adding an entire new layer to the meaning. The film is a reminder to live life in the moment. To take opportunities. The cinematography was brilliant across the film, with gorgeous wide shots and clever use of merging text with the environment. There were very few scenes that felt forced and pushed in to pad the run time. Stiller, the director showed competence in blending the artistic setting of the film and comedy, so that it didn't feel that the comedy was dumbing down the film or its meaning. It was mainly a way to pull in a broader audience. The performances were excellent, from the lead, to the child actor in the film. It had a professional, yet creative and imaginative air throughout. There were a couple of poor moments across the film. For example, sometimes, when the film didn't have a proper solution to a problem that was laid out, they would go down the Ex Machina route and create some sort of cheap cop out to resolve the scene. Other than that, there were a few other minor details that are so minor that they could easily be looked past. Overall, this is definitely up there with my favorite films.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Great characters, amusing animation, and laugh-out-loud humor. Also, watch for the little skit shown after the credits. www.sineemo.com It's all great stuff that simply must be seen.
Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year- old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.
The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.""This is a marvelous bio-pic of a man who suffers throughout life for his art. David Helfgott, an Australian, is a wunderkind pianist who is abused and betrayed by his father, and robbed of his childhood. It is sort of the classic smothering that takes place when a sensitive artist loses his soul for a time. Eventually, Helfgott gets to perform but finds himself immersed in schizophrenia and mental illness for years. The world lost him for a time. But there's more to the story. Geoffrey Rush, whom I had never heard of at the time, is brilliant as the damaged artist. He expresses the deep depression of the character and his genius. The film is able to show the darkness of the soul through its cinematography. The film is inspiring but only because of its portrayal of pain""𝐻𝑢𝑔𝑜 gives viewers a reason to fall in love with cinema the same way 𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑎 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑜 (1988) did. The film follows Hugo Cabret, the son of a clock mechanic who, after his father's sudden death, becomes an orphan. Hugo then makes it his duty to finish the last thing him and his father were working on, a broken automaton. The visuals in 𝐻𝑢𝑔𝑜 show the intricacy of set design and do a good job at recreating Gare Montparnasse in the 1930s the movie was also shot in 3D. 𝐻𝑢𝑔𝑜 also contains great acting from everyone involved. Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Mortez provide great performances as the two main stars and are genuinely likable characters with great chemistry together. Another enjoyable performance is Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Georges Méliès was also a highlight as he plays a disgruntled former filmmaker looking for purpose in his life post cinema. 𝐻𝑢𝑔𝑜 is able to blend the fictitious with the real and it works seamlessly. Martin Scorsese clearly wanted to make a different picture this time around. Few films give the viewer the same sense sense of hope and inspiration that 𝐻𝑢𝑔𝑜 does and luckily, all ages are able to be inspired by this movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Janet Leigh received a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for the secretary who steals money only to make a wrong turn on the highway and wind up at the Bates Motel. Guests generally check in and do check out in the most ghastly manner.
This is an intense psychological thriller with Anthony Perkins stealing the show as the psychotic killer who has also assumed the identity of the mother he murdered 10 years before and her apparent cruelty sticks with him from the deeds he has done.
It does take for picture's end for Simon Oakland, as the detective, to explain what has been going on.
Vera Miles, as her sister, John Gavin, as her lover, and Martin Balsam, the detective who sets out to find her after she is missing, are all in her orbit. That shower scene shall forever be eerie."*** This review may contain spoilers *** The plot might have a peppering of cliché however the stars of this film sell us this story line on a silver platter. The screenplay is is a masterpiece of real and raw dialogue with perfect Boston locations. Tension ebbs and flows to a perfect breaking point to deliver a five star climax. I love seeing Leo and Matt go toe to toe. The Depatrted truly captures the Bostonian culture built on its own cast-iron bravado. The choice of songs and scores develops the harsh and scary undertones that compliment the tense environment the characters work within. Jack Nicholson is the dark force to be reckoned with! Wow! His character makes The Godfather look like an old softy. This movie is not your typical dirty cop story because it has a more complex plot that shows how this house of cards is actually constructed. This film makes me think twice about ever ticking off a guy from Southy or Providence!"*** This review may contain spoilers *** I'm throwing on an extra point, since it's one of my favorite movies to watch. P2 is not a perfect movie, but it's a fun and thrilling experience. If the third act could be completely overhauled, then it would rival Predator 1 in overall quality.
What P2 has that P1 does not have is the fun-factor. It has more colorful characters and a wide variation of scenery, offering a very good presentation of Los Angeles. The decision to make it more humorous was a correct one, but unfortunately problems arise.
The third act for whatever reason became a campy mess. Let me just add her as well that I wish Keyes would've lived, as he was a solid character as Harrigan's mysterious rival. The predator up to his unmasking was presented masterfully, but the unmasking turned it into a comedy puppet. Did Fox do this on purpose to make the movie flop? Who knows. Regardless, it excels where most sequels do not, and as-of today is the only true sequel for the Predator franchise""Paul Muni is magnificent as a machine gun toting sociopath. He is the opposite of the sophisticated killer that romanticized the criminal as a suave, but evil monster. He is actually quite ugly (though Muni was a handsome man), a kind of Neanderthal who almost gets a sexual thrill out of killing the competition. Of course, we don't have the graphic violence that modern crime movies have, blood and dismemberment, but the body count goes up and up and Scarface gets more and more powerful. The women in this film are also interesting. They provide a kind of Freudian angle on the bad guy. Nothing like Cagney in White Heat, where it's so obvious, but a brother/sister fixation over everything. It is hard to watch at times. Of course, it begins with a warning that we, the people, need to do all we can to put a stop to this.""Good Will Hunting is a great film with an inspiring message. As I was watching this film for the first time in seventh grade, I felt extremely empowered and emotional. I'm sure I wouldn't have the same reaction now, but this film holds a very special nostalgic place in my memory.
The movie is very quotable, with famous lines like "" you like apples"", etc. The story can be cliché at times, but it overall it does this to be as relate able as possible, similar to the book the alchemist. Overall, I felt this film is a 9/10, because of it's nostalgic value, good writing, and solid jokes.""In shortit's awesome. Kung Fu Panda is the best CGI-animation movie since The Incredibles. Clever writing, gorgeous animation, fun action, and stellar vocal work by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, and(drumroll please)Jackie Chan! The latter lends a feel of authenticity to this kung-fu themed flick, but you don't have to be a martial arts aficionado to enjoy the ride. Like The Incredibles, this works on multiple levels: kids movie, adult comedy, fantasy, and action movie. Jack Black is immensely likable and Dustin Hoffman charms. There's even some decent morality and philosophy going on. And it'll make you laugh. What more do you want? **** (out of five).""It is a very Gd movie and Gd to the eye and stimulating to the brain ply

The movie is carried mainly on its novel theme & the top cast performances and some good direction. The dialogues are inspiring and thought-provoking. But what really helps the viewers to enjoy the movie is the humorous way in which it is able to send a message. Agreed some of the humor was a bit corny but still it keeps you glued to the screen until the end. Amir Khan was a class apart. Almost each of his scenes had some message in it, in a straightforward or comical way. Madhavan & Sharman were the perfect supporting casts. Boman Irani made up a truly memorable performance & Omi Vaidya was hilariously & annoyingly brilliant as Chatur. Kareena Kapoor too did good. Rajkumar Hirani has another movie etched into Bollywood's hall of fame.
CAST performance: 10/10 Direction: 9/10 Social Message:10/10 Overall:9.8/10
Watch this movie any time and you won't feel bad for the rest of the day.""I'm finally getting around to the 4 R's: re-watching, refreshing my mind, rating and reviewing the film. It's a film that is hard to forget but to re-watch it again is always good to refreshen the memory.
I don't think I need to rehash what the film is about because others have done that and most people have already seen it. But do want to it's a good film to watch if you haven't seen it. It's a supernatural horror-thriller, a mystery and a drama that is unforgettable.
I recently acquired this film for my collection. It's great to see again. One of those movies you don't mind watching from time to time.
8/10""What a movie, came out of nowhere and was sitting on my list for a long time before i downloaded for a flight due to lack of anything else to watch. Seems Netflix has a promising future in the movie department now too.
Draws understandable comparisons with Zulu, but the real shame is behind the true story here and the reason why it's not a widely known about event.
Ignoring the real events (which were incredible and worth further research) the movie really stands on its own as a thoroughly entertaining war film. Tensions builds nicely and results in a whole load of impressive action sequences.
Credit to Dornan who is unfortunately going to be more known for the whole 50 shades nonsense, hopefully once he gets past that he wont be held back on more decent roles."This is scarier then The Shinning. And that is not easy to do. One horror film then this scarier is Gremlins. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. This movie is must see. 6.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a great film 6.3 is underrating it. I give it 9 out of 10. If this movie does not scarier you then no movie will. This is one the best horror movies from the 90's. This movie is a must see. It not for people who like movie with a lot of blood. If you like that you should see 12 years a slave. This is for people who like a good horror stories. This is one the beast horror stories of the 90's."Karyn Kusama is an interesting director. I haven't seen Aeon Flux, but I enjoy Jennifer's Body. The Invitation is a quieter film compared to Jennifer's Body. It goes for a psychological approach which means it is a slow burn, but delivers a worthy climax.
Good: Kusama directs the hell out of this movie with interesting camera angles, muted colors, and a stunning look of L.A. The story flows slowly as it builds on the weird interactions between the couple and their guests. You can tell something weird is going on, but it has fun moving it back and forth on what could possibly happen. The acting is restrained, but it adds to the uneasiness of the film. The climax delivers on the horror side of this horror thriller with a great final shot.
Bad: The first half does tend to slow a bit where it can feel to drag the film down a bit. The climax does go in the direction that while interesting is not so shocking that the audience couldn't figure it out.
Overall, while it does take its time to get going and the reveal is fairly obvious, it is still a strong horror thriller with great directing and an uneasy mood.""It's been a few years since this film came out and when it came out, it was the best football film ever. It still holds the crown as films like Pele, United Passions, Heleno, Montevideo Bog Te Video, United are not better than this.
Forest fans and people that know Clough better will disagree with Clough's depiction in this picture. It is inaccurate to say the least, but that doesn't detract from the quality of this film.
A more accurate picture could've made this film better for some, but its inaccuracy did not reduce my enjoyment of this film.
It is a great film, a story of two friends that go through good times and bad, but it's also a story of two rivals, an underdog vs the man who is the establishment himself (Leeds United, England NT).
I wish someone would make ""Clough, the Forest years"" so we can see more of Sir Brian, his ups and downs, reaching the limit (the unbeaten run, the league, the two European cups) but also real downs (falling out with Taylor, alcoholism) and funny episodes such as punching the fans.
All of Nottingham would watch that film and many football fans, make it realistic this time.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The story is so interesting. It's about a girl with vagina dentata, whose vagina is able to bite off the cock of any guy who dares to rape her.
If every girl were like this, it would surely make sex an exciting adventure for guys, and male rapists could be eliminated from this planet. But then, female rapists of men would be an issue.
At the end of the movie, the girl looked at the audience and smiled. The old pervert trying to take advantage of her is gonna have hell to pay. Yes the girl would use her secret weapon for self defence. But it does open up a whole new area. Imagine what a sequel would be like in which the girl goes for hunting...
:) It's a terrific movie, erotic, bold, and weird in a good way. I love weird movies like this!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie is just amazing. every character was portrayed so well the music and outfits were perfect everything just went great together. I don't believe anyone could of played Alan Turing better between being normal and after the case and Alan gets put on drugs Benedict played it wonderfully. Matthew Goode interpretation of Hugh was on point, he acted mean and angry wonderfully and played the nice guy even better. The dialog between Alan and John was played perfect by Benedict and Allen Leech, this really showed when Alan found out John was the spy. Knightley plays Joan great between the facial expressions and the pausing in her dialog.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When you hear about Saw, what comes up straight into your mind are images of a splatter movie, celebrating violence without worshiping the plot too much. In my opinion that is a completely false judgment.
To me, the movie is a classical psycho-thriller rather than a Horror movie actually, even though the borders are naturally fluent. What I really liked is how much thought is put into when to release which information. I can honestly say that I didn't predict many of the details that came to light, including the excellent end.
Of course the movie gains some of its success from the language of violence it carries, but honestly, there's nothing so bad in it, that you couldn't have seen it a dozen times before. And in part the degree of violence helps to create an atmosphere in which the audience can really feel the desperation of the protagonists grow.
In my eyes, this is a better approach towards an excellent thriller than many others I've seen lately. I respect the mixed critics but recommend a watch if you're okay with seeing explicit images.""The Tree of Life is perhaps one of the most unique visions I've ever seen put on the screen. It combines the fine details of a family's American story with a sprawling spiritual and existential look at the cosmos and what lies beyond our lives.
It is a spectacular work of art, and pushes the limits of how beauty and spirituality fit in film. It is as if Malick is putting everything he has ever dreamed of and thought of in one film and hoisting it up to his peril for all to see. The result is breathtaking and transcendent.
The long, daunting shots of the universe drag on and on and yet you never get tired of them. The beauty maintains its composure. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain give deep and moving performances. Sean Penn's character is so depressed and lost it's difficult to gauge if it took any skill to play him, but you feel his pain and sadness.
The photography of the film is simply spectacular and hoists your mind up into the realm of transcendence throughout the work. You cannot view the contents of this film without seriously examining your life and its purpose. Malick succeeds tremendously in what he sets out to do.
I could go on and on about this film but I will stop here by saying it is definitely one of the most special experience I've had in the movie theater. Anyone and everyone should go see it and really think about what it's saying to you.""One of my biggest regrets in life is not seeing any of the Lord of the Rings movies in theaters. At the time, I just wasn't all that into them. Eventually friends and family members of mine convinced me to check it out. As soon as The Fellowship of the Ring ended, I knew I was hooked.
""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien and is set in the world of Middle Earth. In this world long ago, there lived an evil dark lord named Sauron, who forged the One Ring of power. Sauron is eventually defeated but his ring is lost for centuries, eventually ending up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. Frodo learns of the ring's past, as well as Sauron's return, and that if Sauron were to regain this ring, he could take physical form again and bring destruction to Middle Earth. Together with eight other companions, Frodo sets out for the land of Mordor to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom.
So, where to start? First of all, this is a film that beautifully captured the world that it was trying to bring to life from Tolkien's novels. It never felt like a location that they were shooting the film in; it felt real and alive and made you want to go there. Not only that, but it added the mythology of Middle Earth in perfectly, not beating you over the head with it but using it as a way to advance the story and expand the world. After this movie, I wanted to go to New Zealand just so that I could be ""in Middle Earth"" (I still do).
The performances are also incredible, and you fall in love with every one of these characters. Elijah Wood, who was 18 when he started shooting these movies, showed that he could bring a lot of emotion and weight to the character of Frodo, and showed his shift from someone who lives in a peaceful world only to be sucked into this world of evil. Ian McKellen is also perfect as Gandalf and gives perhaps the best performance in the movie. Sean Astin is great as Frodo's undying companion Sam, Viggo Mortenson shines as the heroic but conflicted Aragorn, and Christopher Lee is great as the villain Saruman. As for the other cast members, they are all incredible and, overall, they not only play their characters but become them.
This movie is epic in every single way. Every aspect, from the battle sequences, to the cinematography, to the music, to visual effects, EVERYTHING about this movie is epic. Not to mention, the movie succeeds in every one of these aspects. The action and battle sequences in this movie, as well as the two sequels that followed, are the golden standard for battle scene filmmaking. The music, composed by Howard Shore, is able to combine the mystery and majesty of Middle-Earth with the epic feel that carries with the story; it's one of the best film scores ever written. The visual effects are top notch and still look fantastic even to this day. Everything about this movie is at a ten.
And did I mention how many great scenes are in this movie? From the opening prologue, to the cave troll fight in Moria, to the Bridge of Khazad Dumb sequences, there are so many memorable and incredible sequences. And at three hours (almost three and a half if you watch the extended cut), it never feels boring at all. Finally, the emotion of the movie is strong. This is not all spectacle without any heart. You feel the weight of this journey and also feel for the characters. The movie has a lot of heart, which makes it more than just your typical fantasy film.
Overall, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an outstanding achievement in cinema, and is a fantastic start to a fantastic trilogy. These three movies are among my favorites and nothing I say in this review can truly describe how good they are and how much I love them. Check them out and see for yourself.""If you're into STEM and designing cool stuff and becoming the next Tony Stark, then you'll like Big Hero 6. The technology these guys have, and the brains to use it, is insane. A telling foreshadowing of what future San Francisco/Tokyo might look like, a microcosm of a society run by technology and its continual advancement.
Soundtrack by Henry Jackman, the same guy who did X-Men and Captain America. Suits the setting well, and you'll love the main single ""Immortals"" by Fall Out Boy.
The animation is crazy; as I saw with Zootopia, I could see how much Disney has improved since Snow White back in 1937. Some pretty nice fight sequences with the heroes' upgrades, and damn! the attention to detail is exquisite. Every scene and shot is SO detailed, down to the last sprocket.
Unlike most modern Disney films, this one didn't really feature the theme(s) of following your dreams and/or forging your own identity. It's a hero story, and this is indeed Disney's first time adapting Marvel Comics material. (Disney bought Marvel, after all.) I liked the message of helping others and doing what is right, as exemplified by the robot Baymax. The theme of friendship and sticking together. Of revenge. (Just kidding.) Anyways, I certainly didn't regret watching this past midnight. I can always expect the best from Disney.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After watching the movie's name ""rush hour"", I'm just have to say that I'm so impress at the way the director created the story. Every body knows this movie's about a girl whom father's a rich person is kidnapped for money, with the help of 2 inspectors one from LA official and another's HongKong one that can help the girl out of danger situation. Along with the humor and thrilling at the writing style of two main characters by Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, the movie's become more melody and funny but it's also have some several fight scenes at the same time.
About the detail which I impressed most is when the little girl in car and sung a pop song. Well, I think it's so funny and i had had a great time after watching it.
On of the highlight in this movie's the way they create character personality. I'm totally interested in the ""black"" cop. He makes people believed that he's such a wise guy. Some people recommend about him as a negative personality because he doesn't help the case at all, sometime he just makes it more mess.But he's the most important to solve the case, without him the girl can escaped, his partner may gonna be died and so on. In conclusion, I love this movie at the way they ending it. No twist in this case that watcher don't understand, characters's all happy and the most important's it showed that ""justice always wins""""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is HUGE, many of the scenes are (still) breathtaking and very well made.
The best part of the movie is the dramatic presentation and the intense interactions between the characters, who are all very well written.
The actors all do a fantastic job, most of all Peter Ustinov, who plays a terrifyingly vindicated Nero.
The musical score fits the very good cinematography perfectly, so are the costumes and enormous sets.
The story is very dramatic and has some very interesting themes about believe and Christianity, which seems preachy, but works in the context of the story and setting.
The practical effects and model-shots are amazing for the time, and the bluescreen effects are noticeable but very clean.
This movie is grand in scale and very dramatic, like a monumental tale should be..."I loved the movie! I will say that it raised my blood pressure 100 points though. Watching Americans under fire after this lying administration told sold many lies and acted so cowardly made me sick to my stomach. The outcome is what you get when unqualified incompetent people are put in charge. This movie should be considered a documentary and proof in court to prosecute clinton and this administration! They pay the taliban/isis to bring home a deserter traitor but couldn't activate units to assist Americans under fire for 13 hours? Total disgrace to America and Americans. The movie shows what happens when unqualified people make decisions in a combat zone concerning ROE. This is a movie that all Americans need to watch to understand how most muslims will act toward non-muslims."My, oh my. How serious everybody is in this story. It was almost akin to a very early episode of Dragnet.
All the men are well dressed and straight up like a fence post. All the women are in fur coats and nice hats.
There isn't a joke or lighthearted moment to be had. It's all very, very serious.
The plot is just plain dumb but nobody really cares. I didn't. It's a joy to watch a young and stunning Ava Gardner and Burt Lancaster.
Burt's boxing sequences are about as believable as Santa Clause, and Ava Gardner's 'Kitty' is as cliché' as it gets. She might as well show up as one of those mysterious smoky women in a detective movie on a dark and stormy night. Again, no one cares.
Ava can't sing for squat, but the woman is flat out gorgeous. I can only imagine the power she must have had at one time during Hollywood's golden era.
The film is classic noir. It always seems to be at night, and everybody smokes cigarettes.
I'm in.""Obviously the road name itself may remind you of a certain movie from the year 2008. A movie that was shot as ""found footage"", unlike this one right here. Although the space is confined and this could've gone the same route too, which it doesn't. John Goodman plays host here and what a host he is ... Which is more of a question than a statement to be truthful, but I'll let it stay.
There are actually a lot of questions in this one. One of them being if there actually are Aliens as proposed by Goodmans character or if he's just crazy. The road name adds to the mystery and there are a lot of strange things that may interpreted in one way or another. Actually because this is plays in a closed place, the tension is high and you don't really know if there is an escape or a look to the outside ... will there be? Do you want to watch this and does it sound intriguing? Then go ahead""This movie is the 3rd in a series of five. The general plot involves a girl who desires to be a vampire. She is torn between loving a werewolf and loving a vampire. The actors and actress are a curious bunch that seems to grab and maintain your attention. Each of the first three movies move painfully slow, but deliberate enough that it gives one time to think about these circumstances from many different angles. I give the movie a ten, because I can see the care and effort that the team put in to create these three movies. I'm looking forward to watching the next two movies. The next two movies are Breaking Dawn Part 1 and Part 2. I actually started research twilight phases, this is what brought me to these movies, and I'm glad it did.""""Reds"" was Warren Beatty's ambitious passion project of 1981, the film that was supposed to clean up at the Oscars that year. The Academy ended up being fairly cool toward it, giving it only three awards out of 12 nominations, but it did finally recognize Beatty for his balls if nothing else by giving him the Best Director Oscar.
It's a good film that holds up well, even if it can be a bit dry at times. Beatty (Oscar nominated) is compelling as Communist revolutionary John Reed, who worked tirelessly to bring a Socialist revolution to America, but he's outshone in the acting department by Diane Keaton (also Oscar nominated), who gets a chance to shed her Woody Allen persona and prove what a good dramatic actress she could be. I could have done with less of the domestic squabbling that drags down the middle part of the film, and found the parts detailing the couple's experiences in Russia to be the most engrossing. The movie has a whopper of a running time (3 and a half hours) but even at the slower parts I never felt especially impatient with its length.
Maureen Stapleton won an Oscar for her fiery performance as Emma Goldman, and Vittorio Storaro won his second Oscar for cinematography (bookended by his work on ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Last Emperor""). The film's other nomination were for Best Picture, Best Actor (Beatty), Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson, never especially convincing as playwright Eugene O'Neill), Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound. Alas, no nomination for Stephen Sondheim who provided the original score.
Incidentally, ""Reds"" became the 13th and last film to win Oscar nominations in all four acting categories until David O. Russell added back to back films number 14 and 15 with ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle."" He's the only director to achieve that feat two years in a row.
Grade: A""1. Having watched movies with varied sense of humor, it chuckles me in places. Not a laugh riot.
2. Story is brilliant, acting is at par.
3. Music is intriguing.
4. Cast is legendary.
5. I think some scenes could have been shorter.
6. The tone is consistent.
7. For me some story line was predictable. But I enjoyed it nevertheless.
8. The movie wasn't trying to catch my attention every scene. Instead it went to craft a story which hits you hard.
9. Kundan shah's direction is brilliant.
10. Considering the time it was made, it was ahead of it times.
11. The story isn't lost in the whole premise of the movie 12. A time well spent in a movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Kill Bill Volume 1 was a critical success, but some Tarantino fans who enjoyed Jackie Brown because it was a more mature piece from Tarantino were left disappointed, feeling that Tarantino had disappeared up his own backside in producing a movie that was supposedly nothing but OTT violence and action sequences.
Kill Bill Volume 2, however, showed that Tarantino has not at all forgotten his roots in favour of style. Kill Bill Volume 2 satisfies those who felt Volume 1 was missing substance by delivering it in abundance, while still retaining some of the style from Volume 1, in this masterful second chapter. While Volume 1, as great as it was, was what people thing a Tarantino movie is, this film was more of a pure Tarantino movie in that it uses dialogue to drive the plot and adds much more depth to the characters, and ends up revealing the Kill Bill saga as a sort of tragic romance story, which I never saw coming even though the first installment revealed that Bill was the father of the Bride's baby.
The majority of the final half hour of Kill Bill V2 is heavily compelling despite being almost completely dialogue driven and focusing on just two actors for most of the time. It is masterfully written and directed by Tarantino and masterfully acted by Uma Thurman and especially David Carradine, who gives one of the best performances of any actor in 2004, if not the best. Criminally, neither actor received a nod at the Oscars, although both were nominated at the Golden Globes and other award ceremonies for their performances. The entire final act of the movie, as well as flashbacks of the Bride and Bill's past littered throughout, help to give a lot of depth to their characters, and the addition of the daughter even allows the saga to have some emotion added into it, as well as a satisfying conclusion.
That's not to say the film doesn't still have some style to it to satisfy fans of the first movie, because it does, in the first half especially, with sequences such as the thrilling fight between The Bride and Elle and the Bride being buried alive and remembering her training to escape, although even these elements are impressively purely story driven.
Tarantino also again makes wonderful use of music in this second chapter, to even more effect than the first in some cases. In particular, I love the use of ""About Her"", Malcolm McLaren's mash-up of lines from the songs St. Louis Blues by Bessie Smith and She's Not There by The Zombies, which fits the scene it is placed in and the Bride and Bill's relationship perfectly. Both songs used in the two very different and stylish end credits scenes are also great.
On the whole, Kill Bill (both volumes) was a phenomenal saga, and I believe Tarantino's best work aside from Pulp Fiction. Volume 2 is the better half on the whole as it added depth to what seemed like an exercise in style over substance.""The producers of Predator 2 went out of their way to produce a sequel that would be bigger, louder & even more egregiously violent than the original Predator, and they largely succeeded.
This one takes places on the chaotic streets of Los Angeles in the midst of a violent drug war between Mexican drug gangs and the Jamaican Voodoo Posse with another alien predator stalking for human trophies. Danny Glover is a veteran cop who chases down the predator and gets crossed with Gary Busey who plays a government agent who's following the predator for his own purposes.
Good cast, good script and good production makes this a much better than average sequel and a film that's far better than the other predator and AVP sequels that followed. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well, and you won't even miss Arnold.""Orphan (2009) really is a great horror film! The acting, the storyline/plot, and the execution of that plot is all done very very well, and all in an entertaining way! The movie revolves around Esther, a 9 year old orphan girl who is adopted by a married couple with 2 children. They decide to adopt because their 3rd child was a stillborn. Vera Farmiga turns in a terrific performance as Kate Coleman, and so does Peter Sarsgaard as John Coleman. And Isabelle Fuhrman is awesome as Esther!! I mean she really does give it her all in this starring role, she's menacing, innocent seeming when she needs to be, and shows great potential for such a young actress. The plot seems pretty cut and dry at first, family adopts killer evil kid, there certainly has been killer kid movies before, but this one sets itself apart from movies like case 39, or The Omen, you'll have to go and watch it though, I never spoil movies in reviews. The movie is successful in keeping the suspense and chill going throughout the entire movie. I 100% suggest this movie if you like a really well made horror film. 9/10!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The adventures of an orphaned boy named Pete and his best friend Elliot, who just so happens to be a dragon. I really don't get the hate for Pete's Dragon i really don't this film surprised me just from the first 5 minutes it was sweet, beautiful looking and the cgi were fantastic. The friendship between Pete and Elliot was adorable, the performances by the entire cast were fantastic especially Oakes Fegley, Oona Laurence, Bryce Dallas Howard and Robert Redford who i wish that had a much bigger role in here but i really did enjoyed his performance. The soundtrack was full of wonder and magic and the overall story was very different than the actual film that it was based on and it makes sense at this point. Overall Pete's Dragon was a surprising well made film and i really can't say that i had any problems with and in my book it's another great and strong Disney film that totally needs your support, just judge it for yourself and have fun with it it's not a classic for sure but if there's people out there that really check it out within the next 3 to 4 years it might actually become one and if you love The Jungle Book you won't be disappointed with this one too.""You take a pill, and your mind clears. You can consider dozens of scenarios at once. You have perfect recall. You find yourself able to keep up with, and even surpass the smartest people on the planet.
What do you do? What challenges do you face? At what cost will you gain your wildest dreams?
The movie shows the desperation and need of a drug addict, given the perspective of someone who believes that the drug actually benefits their life. It demonstrates the ambition of someone who honestly believes that they can have it all. And it does it well. As someone who goes to a elite liberal arts school, I have seem people with absolutely freakish levels of intelligence and ambition. And they think and/or behave shockingly similarly to Eddie Morra. So this movie is not really as unrealistic as people might think.
Bradley Cooper really makes this film. This is only a 9 out of 10 because the plot dominates the roles of all the other characters, so we don't really get to see their complexities.""The 1977 'Pete's Dragon' was a favourite as a child. As far as by today's standards, while not a great film and not as good through adult eyes (plus there are better live-action Disney films, especially the timeless 'Mary Poppins'), it's still well worth watching.
Despite having some really talented names on board, expectations were both of great interest but feeling dubious. It did have potential to be better than the 1977 film, and still stand very well on its own, or it could have been a lazy and pointless cash-grab. While it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, it proved to be a better film than anticipated.
Not one of the best live-action Disney re-imaginings like 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' (much better than 'Maleficent' though), but still for a re-imagining 'Pete's Dragon' was a good one. It is let down by the final act, where the darker and more action-packed tone jars with what was happening before in the film and at this point the film starts to feel rushed. The villain just felt very shoehorned in and out of place, for the sake of ""needing"" an ""obligatory"" villain for conflict (that to me wasn't necessary), not helped by the hammy performance of Karl Urban that just feels out of kilter with the rest of the cast.
Where 'Pete's Dragon' especially soars is in the very charming and touching friendship chemistry between Pete and Elliot, essentially the heart of the film. Speaking of Elliot, he is a very lovingly crafted creature with not just beautiful details to him but also with a personality that wins one over in how endearing he is.
'Pete's Dragon', apart from some overly grim lighting in places, looks great visually, the splendid scenery being especially good complemented beautifully by cinematography that's atmospheric and picturesque. The music is lovingly whimsical and fits the film well when it could easily have not done.
Scripting serves its purpose well and doesn't hurt the atmosphere or the central friendship at all, weakening only with the villain and when the film gets darker. David Lowery directs very capably and balances the various elements well. Although it won't work, and hasn't worked, for some (with criticisms of it being thin narratively, slow-moving and either too sentimental or cold), for me the story (radically altered with a more sombre tone for example) was immensely charming and appreciated the calmer, straightforward, more gentle and deliberate nature of the story which allowed the friendship to resonate. Never found it mawkish and thought that there was enough emotion without it overshadowing things, though admittedly there is not much that is particularly new.
Urban aside, the acting is good. Oakes Fegley and Oona Laurence are very appealing, while Bryce Dallas Howard is luminous and compassionate and, while not being on screen for long, Robert Redford achieves the right balance of the grizzled and the sympathetic. But essentially it is Elliot and the friendship between him and Pete that carry the film, and, as they should, captivate most strongly.
In summary, while with its foibles 'Pete's Dragon' was a much more impressive re-imagining than expected after mixed expectations. 8/10 Bethany Cox""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One of the best war movies ever, and especially of WW1. Kirk Douglas has an especially fine performance as Col. Dax, and George Macready is simply terrific as the merciless and incompetent general ordering the attack. Adolphe Menjou shines as the crafty commanding general.
The supporting cast is excellent also, particularly the condemned trio, J Turkel, Meeker, and Carey. One weak spot to me, was Wayne Morris who seemed miscast. I expected him to break out in a football cheer at any moment. However, he, too, gets his due when he is exposed as a coward.
The battle scenes were good but were overshadowed by the the court martial , imprisonment, and execution. Especially touching, too, was the appearance of the young German girl singing in the the cabaret. The real corker was when Macready is exposed as the real culprit at the end.""In Korea, the pickpocket Sook-Hee (Tae-ri Kim) is hired by the Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim) to be her personal servant. Hideko is supported by her Uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo) and the gold-digger ""Count Fujiwara"" (Jung-woo Ha), who is indeed son of peasants, wants to marry her to steal her inheritance. Sook-Hee is a small-time thief of the ring of the conman ""Count Fujiwara"" and is sent to help him in the confidence game. But soon Hideko and Sook- Hee get close to each other and become lovers. But Sook-Hee is pressed by Fujiwara to betray her friend. When Fujiwara marries Hideko, they go with Sook-Hee to an asylum and the nurses hold Sook- Hee believing that she is Hideko. Why Hideko poses of servant and leaves Sook-Hee in the asylum to stay with Count Fujiwara?
""Ah-ga-ssi"", a.k.a. ""The Handmaiden"", is a classy South Korean erotic thriller divided in three parts and directed by Chan-wook Park. The first part is slow paced and shows the development of the relationship among Sook-Hee, Lady Hideko and ""Count Fujiwara"". The second part shows the abusive relationship of Uncle Kouzuki and Hideko since her childhood. The third part has many twists and shows the fate of each leader character. The cinematography is very beautiful and the eroticism is elegant and stylish. The screenplay has surprising plot points. My vote is eight.
Title (Brazl): ""A Criada"" (""The Maid"")""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It's very difficult to assign a genre/film category to 'The Invitation'. Is it a hardcore drama? I think so. Is it a psychological thriller? Most certainly as it revels in its atmosphere of dread. Is it a horror film? From a certain angle, yes as there are moments of exploitation and gore which horror film fans will be familiar with. From a personal standpoint, my favourite horror/thrillers are the ones that work on a thematic as well as a generic level and 'The Invitation' is a prime example of a film that achieves success in that regard.
I have to shower admiration on the screenplay written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. The script uses the central character of Will to give us a very poignant and sensitive exploration of grief and the struggles which come along in the process of dealing with it. Many films attempt to show us characters dealing with grief, but on many occasions, they can be underwhelming due to the lack of sophistication. 'The Invitation' offers us a very mature depiction of how it can be like to live with grief. The character remains somewhat aloof throughout the party. He has become a loner and seems uncomfortable for having to spend a whole evening in the house where he once used to stay with his family and where he had to experience the most painful event of his life. He wants to move on, but can't get rid of his self created guilt. He views Eden's elaborate attempts of joining a spiritual cult to get over the past as an act of denial. On one hand Will wants to move on, but on the other he thinks that ignoring what happened is a sign of betrayal to the spirit of his dead son. He is constantly fighting with himself.
On a thematic level, the film is saying that grief is personal and the process of recovery is also personal. Your friends and loved ones can support you through the process, but in the end, it is you and only you who can get through it. As the last shot of the film shows, Kira can support Will, but she will never be able to force his recovery or act as a cataylst in his process of rehabilitation. The film takes a cynical stance on the communal nature of dealing with griefs through groups and cults. Forcing the process of rehabilitation as Eden and David attempt to do in the film doesn't serve any purpose.
Karyn Kusama very effectively creates a claustrophobic atmosphere inside the house. She conjures up a tone drenched in paranoia. The film is shown pretty much from the point of view of Will. The editing and the transition from one scene to the next is at times a bit intentionally abrupt to put the doubt in the viewer's mind about whether Will's POV is reliable or not as we all know how distressed and paranoid he is. The film is shot well. The visual colour texture of the film shifts from the orange-ish hue of the scenes in the party to a bluish tinge in the flashback scenes. The camera isn't doing anything too radical, but there are two shots of Will's reflection on the mirror in two separate scenes (the first one involving him and David with the mirror in between them and the second one involving Will alone as we see two lines of multiple reflections on the mirror) that really impressed me. These two shots visually capture in an artistic sense, Will's fragmented psyche and his inner dilemmas.
The acting is good from everyone involved, but I will give a special mention to Logan Marshall-Green and Tammy Blanchard. Green not only looks like Tom Hardy, but also has that charismatic masculine aura about him that one associates with Hardy. He remains stoic for the most part, but then peppers in moments of genuine vulnerability and brilliantly sells the inner turmoil and guilt that Will is going through. Blanchard plays the Hitchcock-ian mystery woman. She always looks mysterious and artificial and we get subtle hints from time to time of the darkness simmering underneath the smile.
'The Invitation' is a brilliant work that succeeds as a suspenseful thriller as well as a mature exploration of grief and its accompanying dilemmas. The direction, writing and acting are pretty much perfect all over the board.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I had never seen this movie, I shied away from it because I don't normally enjoy Tim Burton, but this was a wonderful fairy tale with a lot of emotional depth. Edward is a gentle soul, sheltered away from society until a kind lady happens upon him in his castle and takes him home. The mom, Peg, is who we should all strive to emulate, because she immediately accepts Edward despite his ""differentness"". Her love for Edward as a son remains steadfast, even when the whole town turns against him. Speaking of the town, it's a microcosm of every type of person in society. You have the town ""whore"", the religious nut, the busybody and gossip. They all admire Edward at first, because of his talent for gardening and cutting hair (both human and animal). He is somewhat of a curiosity to the people of the quiet little town, and they all want a piece of Edward's time, so they can say ""I'm his friend"" But it's all for appearances and not real admiration. Things soon turn badly for Edward though, because of a few misunderstandings. He saves a little boy's life from being hit by a drunk driver, but in the process of doing so, injures and scares him with his scissor hands. This quickly turns into a witch-hunt, and the whole town adopts a mob mentality. The ending was quite poignant, not how I would have wanted it to end, but it's Tim Burton, you can't have a happy ending. It ended the way it should have though, if that makes any sense. The whole story is one of tragedy, love and the realization that maybe people who are that different really can't live in a society that is so caught up in appearances.""Was always going to watch this film but was in no hurry as it is long and I thought it seemed weird, Boy, was I wrong!! It is long but did not seem so to me, I stayed up way past my bedtime, and it was definitely NOT weird. The story is very well told, a man born in his eighties and ages backwards, an unusual concept but very well done in this film. I love movies so will probably watch this one again, which I don't often do, so that says a lot about this movie, especially since it is a long one. The acting is great, especially Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson. Brad Pitt is great too, playing Benjamin very subtly and quietly.Love Jared Harris too, as the tugboat captain. The love story between Benjamin and Daisy is magical, to say the least, and don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but that part of the story is wonderful as well as very different. The makeup and visual effects are amazing, as well as the cinematography, I can see why it was nominated for so many Academy awards, and winning some. I think everyone would enjoy this film, it had a huge story line, covering wars, travelling the world, and always going back home. It could have been odd, but with David Finchers direction,and the magical everything else about this film, I think it is a wonderful story about life, love,loss, time,etc. I truly believe everyone should watch this movie, it kept me riveted with the constant changing of history,not knowing what was coming next, it has action, which I was surprised by, love, something for everyone really, a definite must see movie!! Wish I would have watched it sooner!""Excellent, excellent and excellent! Bravo!
All the bad reviews are from people that, either just wrote the review under the wrong movie title, or are too stupid to even get the point of this masterpiece.
Not much to say, just watch the movie for yourself! It is very rare that a movie sucks you in and toys with your mind like this one does. The last 30 minutes are just a roller-coaster of emotions with a satisfying and thought provoking ending!
Amy Adams is just amazing! I smell Oscars!
Do yourself a favour, stop reading the bad reviews and see the movie for yourself! It is hard to explain with words what this movie does to you if you aren't too stupid to get it!""The movie amazingly displays the time period of the Civil War, showing the great scene of the giant explosion that started the Battle of Crater in part of Siege of Petersburg as the opening scene into the movie. Just with this horrific scene of the war, it brought me the feelings of terror and the visions of the war that I could never imagine. It got me absorbed into the movie quickly. Throughout the movie, it provided us the hardships that the main characters, as well as the people that lived through the war, had to survive in. The film not only conveyed one perspective during these terrifying times, it showed us a woman's point of view and what they had endured when the men had to live for war. Additionally, the film portrayed the scenes of the war very well with appropriate attire and choice of music. The director, Anthony Minghella gave the realities of the battles that men were forced to face, for instance, some of the Yankee soldiers were treated brutality. Nevertheless, this film is originally on two lovers (Inman and Ada) that longed for another and hoped to reunite since the Civil War brought them apart.It's a tragic story that both Ada and Inman only have memories of each other to rely on. Also, in the film there were symbols displayed to foreshadow the outcomes of the couples. It was very interesting to connect the dots and predict the outcomes, which I was not expecting.
Briefly, the movie overall was excellent. Not only did it showed the battles that one could not imagine except to those who experienced war. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman both played their character very well. Law portrayed as Inman, a young man that was very considerate and shy that lived in Cold Mountain (NC) while Kidman was Ada that was forced to mature as her father died. This movie had made a great impact on me and I would highly recommend this, however, to those who are very emotional be prepare to cry.""I didn't hear a peep about this film all last year. I discovered it while IMDb'ing Keeping Up With The Joneses.
This movie should enter the canon along with Bottle Rocket, Spy, The Whole 9 Yards or The Spy Who Knew Too Little. It was goofy but in all the right ways. There is a very brief appearance by Ken Marino. In a way that worked against the film because Ken is so funny and only briefly in the story. Anytime McKinnon is on the screen you will laugh. That is guaranteed, as in any of her films. This one is highly recommended. Surprised of it's current IMDb rating which is what inspired this review.""An original screenplay but not an original story that proving that even the most tired genre in the most commonplace setting can be done right while entertaining without the need to check the brain at the door.
Carefully executed, with the right amount of slow pace and plot jolts to keep you interested, the build-up and the necessary ""conclusion"" are done just in the right way. In between, we can't help but see it through the analytic eyes of the character's decay as well as scrutinizing another American corner of Trump's overwhelming electorate.
Hell or High Water is another amazingly shot film in year of gorgeous- looking pictures, as well as expertly acted by an always reliable Jeff Bridges, a devoted Ben Foster and a much undervalued Chris Pine.""1000 reviews and 23 years late.. watched it a hundred times, I thought I'd wait..
The more you watch the more you see, Forrest & Bubba and especially Jenny..
The acting is warm, perfect and makes me think, has there ever been a film that makes me not want to blink..
I'll love it forever and beyond that I'm sure, Forrest Gump is my inspiration I live by his determination and more..
I wish they allowed us to give more than a 10...
Rhyming Tyrrell""I have seen a lot of WW2 films from all sides. I've seen many Yugoslav films from my own country, American films showing either theaters (Pacific or Europe), a few from different countries like France, Poland, etc. quite a few Holocaust ones, ones with their own internal conflict (Finland's war with Russia) etc. I've seen many, many Russian ones (most recently Panfilov's 28) and American ones (Saving Private Ryan, but recently Hacksaw Ridge). I've seen expensive ones and cheap ones (Pathfinders: In the Company of Strangers, budget is supposedly $0, it's all volunteer work), serious ones about the Holocaust and comic ones like Tarantino's. I've seen short ones (The German, 2008) and I've seen Band of Brothers.
I've seen a lot, more than most people.
Having said that, this one is my favorite. It's the only one where I felt I was there, I was not just an observer, but I felt like I was part of the crew.
This is the only film, war or not, in which I felt that I was there. I've never had such a strong connection to a film before.
There may be inaccuracies, the personalities were a bit filmified/movie-ized, but this movie gets 10/10 on the acting and delivery of emotion.
Wow. Just wow.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In recent years so many films have churned out of Hollywood, with indifferent story/acting/substance
So often these, at best mediocre, offerings get rave 10/10 reviews here.
Unlike those films this film has a real story.
Following Hal Moore and his Batalion as they try new tactics at the beginnings of the Vietnam war.
The film doesn't glamorise war but shows the human tragedy and waste (from both sides)
Good acting throughout particularly from Gibson, makes the whole thing believable. Drama on the battlefield and at home where the wives have to deal with the news of casualties.
Thoroughly recommended. 8.5/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** So i just saw this one , and have to say Martin Scorcese ( and Dicaprion again ) does his own here , and never out-dated style ...Brilliant many ways ! And surely more value ,what comes watching this movie several times ...Now i already think ,that maybe i see this again, and soon :D
But. Just few things , out-side of the main focus I was just wondering ,and this is progress .. Why it apparently ,took 65 years , to that Dachau incident ,seeing the light of day ( in main stream media )
What happen was that USA soldiers randomly execute some prison guards , at first glance, and given what they had witness , was pretty unsettling And whole incident was censored until vaguely mentioning ,on war history documentary ,at decades later...
The Scene in the movie contains prisoner trains and lots of dead bodies inside , and Americans though, that the Germans had shoot them ,and then just left to rot. But !! It was instantly clear , from the angle of fire ,that it was done by ( possibly even British ) Fighter jet. And second scene showed ,the execution of more that one or two prison guards, but the whole bunch !!
Well. Dachau was created 1933 - 1945 ,last camp to liberated . And those guards where young boys and others , who where transferred , only some 3 weeks earlier, before the Americans arrive
What comes to rest of the camp ..The piles of bodies , suggest that they all been gassed ?? Well - NO. Field units quickly examined all those bodies. It was only years later conceded, that there was nothing except Typhus epidemic going on . American had Typhus vaccine ,and knew perfectly well ,what is going on. ALL THE TIME !! Germans didn't have Typhus vaccine. They try to use pesticide Zyclon B. But lets not go to this path any further ... Because it has nothing to do with this movie.
Thanks""The Lion King has everything: Hans Zimmer's music, the delicious animation and the wonderful drawings, the superb acting with Mufasa on top and of course the great story this movie tells: it's about life and its stages, the hardness of loss and the difficulty in changing, it's about not running away from your problems, about believing in yourself, about evil, friendship, justice and love...
In the 90s Disney movies got an unusual balance: the stories weren't yet the postmodern crap we have today and they had overcome the rancidity from before. The technology was still paper and pencil and the brand new technologies were just used to create epic scenes from scratch. It's not strange that from The little Mermaid (1989) to Tarzan (1999) it was Disney's second youth and just at the half of the decade they peaked with The Lion King (1994).
If in 2017 we see Bambi (1942) as a timeless classic I'm sure that in 2070 people will see The Lion King the same way. And that is huge""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One of the best comedies I've ever seen. At first, he misses a Little by its narrative style.

Extremely accurate to real physics and an interesting take on what could possibly be.
Overall the movie was produced in an excellent manner and the storyline was great. Many of the plot twists I could speculate about but I was glad when they went one direction or another. You could really connect with the characters when they were trying to contact families and that's something I'm sure many wouldn't even have thought about until you see it from that perspective of someone up in space.
I definitely want to watch Interstellar again!""Hacksaw Ridge is yet another proof that Mel Gibson is a great director, Hacksaw Ridge is top 5 best war movies of that century, the movie resembles quite Full Metal Jacket from Stanley Kubrick, who has 2 act, totally different, the first shows the Doss's life, his relationship with his family, his training and his passion for the doctor Dorothy, Andrew Garfield makes perhaps his best acting career (I have not yet watched Silence), it impressed me, I always found him a middle-aged actor, Vince Vaugh is very well, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, Luce Bracey, Hugh Weaving and etc, the rest of the cast is very competent, the script unfortunately is not perfect, has many problems, has very dialogues Mel Gibson bloody portrays the horror of the war, and he is very good at doing it (Braveheart is proof of this, blood battles and Very well done), the soundtrack is good, the rhythm is very good, it has incredible scenes, I really enjoyed the final scene, and the construction of Desmond in the movie is great, Hacksaw Ridge is undoubtedly one of the best Oscar movies, and If winning will not be unfair, Mel Gibson has to make more war movie. Note 9.6""What's so impressive about Moonlight is how incredibly real it feels. Despite the protagonist, Chiron, being a character often looked by society, the film has an unnerving sense of realism. The script is so real and engaging because everything drives the story forward. Every word uttered makes you think about the overarching story and characters, about identity and masculinity, and about yourself. The film is massive yet intimate; confident, yet not pontificate.
Chiron is played by three actors for the three depicted periods in his life. They all portray Chiron masterfully, but they don't feel like imitations of each other. Director Barry Jenkins restricted the actors from seeing each others' interpretations so that Chiron would feel like a slightly different character throughout his life, and despite this, the film doesn't feel episodic. It feels like a linear story told in the best way it ever could have been.
Not a single moment in the film felt flatthere is not a single misstep. It wrestling with the idea of societal expectationprojecting strength, and hiding vulnerability. The only criticism I can make for this movie is that it didn't fully hook me. The first time I watched each of my favorite films, I was white-knuckled on the edge of my seat from the first frame of the movie. Moonlight didn't so that for me. It's a beautiful story that builds to a very emotionally satisfying finale, but it just didn't enthrall me as much as I would have liked it to. Still, that is a very subjective opinion. Moonlight is undoubtedly one of the best movies of our time. It features marvelous acting, cinematography, screenplay, soundtrack, and casually lyrical camera-work.
This movie will forever live among the greats and absolutely deserves a 10 out of 10.""OK. So it is cheap. The effects are terrible. The acting OK. The music choices vary in quality. Now that I got that out of the way....
This remake was fantastic and amazingly true in tone to the original making many improvements along the way. No spoilers here except to say that the updates made sense, the characters were fun, and everyone seemed to be having a good time making it. Malcolm McDowell did what he does so well playing the villain.
It was episodic, but so was the original. You get the feeling that the director studied the original for what worked, then brought that and a lot more into the remake. Roger Cormen and his daughter produced, so you know it was made by the right people (Cormen produced the original as well)
If you did not like it, you would not have liked the original. It was a worthy remake that reminds us what a lot of imagination can do on a limited budget. Cormen devotees should be thrilled.""From beginning to end I was caught up in the atmosphere and characters of this film. It harked back to some of the feel of 70's thrillers like Thunderbolt and Lightfoot but was its own film entirely. Jeff Bridges is interesting to watch even if he is getting up from a chair! Chris Pine also holds his own. Special mention should go to the cinematography and location work. It really captured the downtrodden locale and empty landscapes well. I also enjoyed a lot of the bit parts in the film, which seemed to be particularly well cast.
Ultimately it was just a solid script and direction to match. See on a big screen!""This is the 4th film from the company that brought us Coraline, the Boxtrolls, and ParaNorman. Claymation is an underrated art and under-appreciated art. I feel like the general audience aren't interested in this art and that's sad. This film is AMAZING. This is a story about a kid named Kubo who is living in hiding from his family because they want to turn Kubo blind. Kubo goes on an adventure with his magical powers and his companions to obtain items to defeat his family once and for all. This film does a great job on portraying the Japanese culture which allows us to connect to the characters with our own family morals. The music in the film works well and the themes of the film Hit Home! This is truly an amazing film and if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor and do so and you may need tissues. I give Kubo a 9.6/10. This was hands down my favorite animated film of 2016.""Its a really good horror comedy, judging by the reviews it just hasn't found its audience yet. A lot of Kevin Smith fans are clearly disillusioned with his more recent turn towards horror comedy. There are very few decent horror comedies being made these days with decent acting, tight stories and scripts; this is one of them. Personally I found it refreshing and original. Not for the squeamish though as it is ridiculously morbid. Michael Parks does a great job acting his part as Howard Howe, as does the other lead actor Justin Long. The script is what really carries the whole thing. In a comedy sfx etc always comes secondary to acting and script, so it doesn't really matter if the effects aren't really great, in fact it puts the audience at ease, allowing them to not take the film so seriously and gross out.""The performances by Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe,and Kevin Costner were compelling. Taraji P. Henson was superb. The story line is remarkable and that it is based on a true story makes it so meaningful.
Aside from the fact that I thought it was well made, strong story line and fantastic chemistry between these characters, it may have resonated more with me from the professions they help, their individual self respect for self and one another, and how they looked beyond their perceived lot in life. To the really life women who the story is about, how courageous you all were and how important was your work. So very happy this story was told in such a tasteful, factual way.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** While sharing the name of the short-story Rashômon, this Kurosawa film is actually in large part based on another Akutagawa story called In a Bamboo Grove. The closest relation it has to its namesake comes through sharing the Rashômon Gate as a location, as well as another small similarity touched upon later.
There are some key differences between the film and the short-story, which serve to illustrate a lot of what Kurosawa attempted with the film. The most obvious one is that while we in the original are only related the testimonies of the different parties involved, we are first taken to the Rashômon in the film. The opening scene is stunningly well-composed, with the broken-down building providing shelter for a peasant (played by Takashi Shimura) and a priest from a seemingly endless rainstorm. As with so many of his other movies, Kurosawa knows how to use nature to produce a mood for his scene. The relentless flood, the shattered gate, the two men with their heads dropped, all speak of a distraught situation. Suddenly another man comes running in through the rain, from the direction of the camera, stomping through the mud to reach shelter.
He asks the peasant and the priest what they are so upset about, and after the newcomer lights a fire, the peasant starts telling the story of a murder. Yet, the murder itself holds not the strangeness of this tale. How it is related to the police is what leaves all those involved confused. The thing is that everyone related (including the victim via a medium) has given a different account of the events. The only common elements being that a bandit loured a couple into a grove, tied up the man, and raped his wife. Here we see the second difference between the stories, because whereas Akutagawa only include the testimonies, Kurosawa includes a second account by the peasant that found the body. This is not related to the police, but rather to the newcomer under the Rashômon, revealing that he thinks everyone else was lying. But, as the newcomer points out, he could very well be lying too. In this way, whilst the original story subtly points out how truth can quickly become a subjective matter, as well as addressing the sadness in the woman's situation  as she is rejected by her husband after being dishonoured by the bandit  Kurosawa instead makes almost a mockery of how our ideas of ourselves end up being what we relate, and how reality often ends up being much less honourable. This is particularly evident in the peasants second account, as the two men almost quiver whilst fighting each other, losing their swords and stumbling several times.
To me, this is where the film almost fumbles a bit. As if it is slightly uncertain what idea it wishes to espouse, the following scene tries to deal with both the consequence of not being able to trust anyone, where the story the peasant told seemed to include a theme of its own. The problem is that if you trust the peasant, the story loses the subtle aspect of Akutagawa's original in that it instead of painting the truth as a loose concept, it paints the people testifying as egotistical. And if you don't trust him, the tale loses the aspect of, almost comically, rendering reality a much less impressive fact than our stories about it. The film ends with the men under the Rashômon finding an abandoned baby and one of them stealing the kimono it is wrapped in, saying that if he does not take it, someone else will (which is similar to Akutagawa's Rashômon story where one of the characters is stealing from the dead under the same mores). After having an argument with the peasant, the kimono-stealer wanders off. The priest has picked up the baby, and when the peasant tries to take him he asks if he wants to steal his linens too. After which the peasant says he has six children and it won't make a difference if he raises another (reminding me of a Turgenev poem about the generosity of those who give from what little they have). The priest apologises, the rain stops, and the film ends. Despite its dour depiction of people, it still wants us to believe in them.
Aside from the slight muddling of themes, Rashômon is a great film filled with lots of great visual elements. Kurosawa, is, as always, a master of movement. His characters move together with the background and the camera to fill every scene with emotion. My favourite shot in the film was of the bandit (portrayed by masterful Toshirô Mifune) on his stomach in the sand, sprawling in agony as he just pushed the policeman that found him into the water. The way Mifune moves is combined with the camera movement to show his traces in the sand, telling the story of his last few minutes in a matter of seconds. Throughout the film, this camera use and Kurosawa's blocking is thoroughly enjoyable, adding onto each scene, whether that is in terms of comedy or tragedy. The acting is also top notch, if at times as over-the-top as is usual with Kurosawa.
The music is pretty good, but did not stand out to me as particularly memorable. It worked well with the scenes it was in, and sometimes preceded the on-camera reveal.
The story is a simple one, and it fumbles a bit in trying to handle several themes, but the film is very well directed and though there isn't much dialogue, the visual acting is tremendous. Mifune stands out. I do wish it was a bit subtler in letting its story speak for itself, like Akutagawa did with the original short-story, as it does not really come through in dealing with the consequences of its themes. In lack of a 8.5 score, I gave the film a 9. Definitely worth watching.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** L.A. Confidential is great, an absolute must-watch!
The movie contains a superb cast with names such as Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and the beautiful Kim Basinger. The last one winning an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her role as Lynn Bracken.
The story is set in 1950 L.A., and corruption in the police force is on the rise. Three police detectives investigate a number of murders in order to uncover the truth.Each has his signature way of serving justice, but as the story goes on, they each have to face their own convictions. How far are they prepared to go?
Bud white (played by Russel Crowe) doesn't always follow the rules by the book and has a though time keeping of controlling his more violent nature.
Then there is his counterpart Ed Exley (played by Guy Pearce). An ambitious man who wants to get ahead without breaking the rules. A challenge which he finds becomes harder and harder on his way to the top.
Last but not least, we have Jack Vincennes (played by Kevin Spacey). An extravagant figure who is always looking to make an extra buck out of his crime fighting career.
Together they must join forces in order to uncover the dark secret within the L.A. police force.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** With his back facing us, he struts out of the dark alley to the ring like a celestial being, little streaks of sunlight pouring from the shafts above in quantity just enough to fashion the contours of his silhouette with gold dust as the chant in the background goes-""Khoon mein tere Mitti, Mitti mein tera Khoon; Upar Allah, Neeche Dharti; Beech mein tera Junoon"". The crowds in the movie become delirious as Sultan makes a grand entrance,as the crowd in the theatre goes berserk at the first sight of Salman. Salman's playing his favourite alter ego- that of a man child with a magnetic charm for the infinite time to the same effect; this time he's called Sultan.
A quintessential Bhai movie is nothing but an elaborate vanity exercise comprising of-catchy numbers, quirky signature steps and fourth wall breaking sequences with iconic lines when Bhai is done breaking some bones. Sultan does all this and much more. It gives us a protagonist who is not saddled with the task of catering to the legion of fans of the star alone. He is a fallible person, who crumbles under the impact of defeat. He is an illiterate who knows to handle the rejection of a woman with dignity. He is a desi wrestler who's Ko move is punctuated with an obeisance.Sultan manages the hitherto unmanageable feat of trespassing beyond the ""Salman"" persona to an unchartered territory called acting, that Bajrangi Bhaijaan almost managed to do.
The road to redemption is staged on screen in an invigorating fashion through the subtle deployment of a few processes as metaphorical devices . Insulted by the woman he loves for the dearth of purpose in his life, he embarks on a journey of self discovery .He starts off with a clear-face shakily,tilling a field singlehandedly to chasing beside a local train. The train zooms past him and there's a lot left to plow in the field. As he makes progress; he's grown a thick stubble now. He almost manages to match the train and the field has significantly been cleared; his limits stretched. By the end of his metamorphosis- the stubble has turned a marked moustache; he races past the train with the field burning ready for cultivation. A new man is born.
There is this point in the movie where a worn out Sultan, past his prime is trying to stage a comeback. He takes his shirt off before the mirror.What he sees is an image of a man who is not just out of shape, but buried beneath the debris of despair and defeat. He implodes with anguish as even his shirt wouldn't peacefully let him sneak in to it. It is one of the rare occasions where our hearts go out in unison for this man, overlooking the star portraying him. Sedentary at soul, he is this lackadaisical individual who wakes up to his potential after instigation. For success has often been his retaliation to instigation- a recurring motif in his life. If Aarfa instigated him with her insult to turn him into a world renown wrestler earlier, a coach now calls him a dead person from the ringside while he gets beaten to pulp, trying to resurrect his carrier in a new form after a sabbatical. Phat comes the killer move - as if in response - as he lays still his opponent.He springs out of the ring defiantly to tell this man, verbally now that he might have quit wrestling, but never stopped fighting.
The romance isn't a gratuitous embellishment to ratify song sequences. It constitutes the very heart and soul of the movie.It gives us his love interest Aarfa, an ambitious-strong woman, an Adrian to his Rocky(just that she's is a wrestler much before he wanted to be one.) She just isn't there as his prosaic arm candy, but insinuates the necessary friction in his life from time to time. There's a beautiful trait she exhibits every time when Sultan makes progress towards something great; she turns away from the happening solicitously. She doesn't want to spectate, but rather participate vicariously in his travails moment by moment. She does this when he enrols as a green horn wrestler to take part in a state level championship. She does this while coaching kids with her back facing the TV playing his MMA matches.
These finer aspects go on to enhance the relatability of the larger than life proceedings, the stuff that we seldom expect out of a Salman starrer. There is this scene where he watches his wedding night's video after dinner in isolation. As the shot segues from the video to his room, he's fallen asleep watching himself fall asleep in the video. We get to know that the nostalgia held in the video is his lullaby. For once the sight of Bhai is not just the excuse to wolf whistle alone, but a calming influence."Despite seeing an obscene amount of movies and being a huge fan of Nolans past work I managed to avoid seeing this movie until I bought the blue ray earlier this year. Needless to say I am exceedingly happy I did. To start things off the movie looks amazing and has amazing special affects and cinematography. Not only does it look good however it also happens to be one of the most original movies ever. I can see the effort that Christopher Nolan put into creating this masterpiece and it is much appreciated. There is no performance in this movie that was anything less than very good and most were exceptional. Hanz Zimmer produced a mind numbing score that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. Also all the little clever details and hidden things that allow your mind to search every second of the film make it all the better. It has some of my favorite movie moments of all time and a few Quote: s as well. The movie even gets better the more times you watch it. Whenever somebody asks me if I were stranded on an island and got to choose one movie I would choose Inception. This movie blew my mind."Upon seeing this movie at the bottom of my drawer I thought I'd give this movie a look and see what I thought of it today. So I turned on my VCR and started watching. Almost immediately a wave of nostalgia hit me and I felt my memories coming back. I genuinely thought this movie was actually good and my grade reflects how it managed to hold up despite its target audience. It has mind blowing music and Quote: s that make this movie feel like it couldn't be a Pokémon movie. Not going to lie there are some things the movie is lacking in such as overall script, voice acting(besides mew two who I thought was fantastic) and some very convenient things. These things are excusable because it was a Pokémon movie targeted towards kids. Overall surprisingly good and 9/10 due to how it outperformed what is expected from these sorts of films.""Today, before watching an animated movie, the biggest question is ""which element of newness can it ever provide to eyes that have enjoyed hundreds of Disney (and even DreamWorks) classics?""
Indeed, as time goes by and the audiences get more blasé, the probability for an animated film to meet with commercial success might be relatively high, but whether it would stand the test of time and become a classic is another story. Each of the three 'Shrek' sequels did pretty well in the box-office, but compared to the first opus, they're all pretty forgettable.
But this is an adjective I wouldn't use for ""The Lego Movie"" as it is a wonderfully crafted and smartly conceived animated comedy. It doesn't just bring enjoyment; it also possesses such a meticulous attention to little details that you wouldn't mind watching it again in case you missed something. Of course, the very premise of an animated movie made of Lego bricks is to challenge the eyes with as many details as one can spot in a simple blink, that's the essence of the Lego bricks, but the writers or creators didn't just take that high-concept for granted: the special effects are the vehicles to a solid plot and a story with a message that is positive without being dull or predictable.
There's a moment where all the protagonists meet in Cuckoo Cloud Land (or was it Cloud Cuckoo Land)? And although some of the characters in the background add nothing to the story, the multiple cameos they form is simply irresistible (they go from Simpsons characters to Ninja Turtles or movies and fairy tales icons) you really have to push the pause button if you want to spot each of them. This perfectionism has nothing to envy on Disney's and reward our expectations as we don't expect uncluttered landscapes from a Lego film. And while it starts with Lego Land and the ominous President Business' building, it also gets out of the urban zone of comfort and make us fly over the vast Western canyons or enjoy a trip on and under the sea, the occasion for many cool effects simulating waves, smokes or clouds.
Last time I had as much fun was with ""Rango"" and there's some kinship between the two films besides not being from Disney (or another 3D major studio), they have extremely appealing heroes. Rango had a certain edgy quality but Emmett (Christ Pratt) is simply too sweet for words. It's like the writers, instead of taking the wrong step and making the most possibly original character, went to the totally opposite trajectory, making an even more original one. This is a Lego-man who sees the half filled glass, who cheers at everything, because in Lego life, everything is built upon instructions, you can't do any wrong because that's an option life doesn't include. So nothing can upset him: the lousy one-joke sitcom, the overpriced coffee, his motto echoes the town's hymn ""Everything is Awesome"", a cheesy electronic pop hit that seems to come directly from the 90's.
But under this cheerful front, Lego Land lives with an impending doom of evil President Business (Will Ferrell) and according to Vitrivirus, a wizard with the voice of Morgan Freeman, a chosen one will save the town (quite a prophecy, isn't it?), it turns out to be Emmett, but he needs to believe it to succeed. The film takes one of the cheesiest clichés but makes it the soul of its message and making something original out of conventional stuff is a stunt I didn't think was possible. And the is the kind of masterstroke I won't dare to spoil but let's just say, there comes a moment where even the comedic inventiveness can't drive the plot, and the writers need an extra push and we make the one discovery that gives its full meaning to the Lego, the reason why anyone can enjoy it.
Speaking for myself, I stopped playing Lego when I got a new digit in my age but playing now with my daughter, I rediscover the appeal behind this simple but genius concept, interlocking brick one or another, creating more and more challenging forms, some with a meaning, others not, but avoiding dullness at all costs. There is something in Lego that is so boundlessly creative, that you can't help but feel the need to reinvent stories or scenarios within the limits of your mind's imagination. It's just as if the 3D animation existed before the screen version, and ""The Lego Movie"" was inevitable. And it is perhaps the only animation process where the temptation of portraying the 'player' was so strong, as if there was something subtly existential or deeply metaphysical in that quest for perfection. I had a foretaste after watching the Simpsons 'Lego' episode, there's indeed some great source of creativity behind these little bricks.
Nevertheless, this quest for perfection is integral to the film's appeal, so is the need to deconstruct things for the sake of imagination. There was something in that Cuckoo Land that reminded me of South Park's ""Imagination Land"", and this is what the film is about: the power of imagination, and that includes imagining yourself as a hero, and being able to build and to decompose as well. And not to make the film sounds too philosophical, it is also a terrific comedy with superb characters, including Elizabeth Banks as the bad-ass WyldStyle (the jokes about her names never get old), a 80's Spaceman and Unikitty, a hilarious mix of Hello Kitty and 'My Little Pony' style unicorns.
Honorable mention to the scene-stealing performance by Bruce Wayne aka Batman and a funny twist on the good cop/bad cop trope, well it's full of pop culture references, they're good but they're not even the best thing about the film.
Everything is awesome in that 'Lego' movie and I'm looking forward for the sequels.""Our country is no stranger to terrorist attacks, and though we have not experienced any sort of event on the scale of the 9/11 attacks, terrorism has increased in a near-alarming rate. This police procedural drama directed by Peter Berg, the filmmaker behind 'Deepwater Horizon' which hit theaters just four months ago, paints a riveting picture of a shocking tragedy that gripped our nation to it's core. That tragedy was the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing by that took a great number of innocent lives. Collaborating with Peter Berg for a third time is Mark Wahlberg who we saw in 'Deepwater Horizon' not too long ago along with the war drama 'Lone Survivor' three years ago. Like Peter Berg's previous two entries, Wahlberg along with a string of A-list actors shine in this moving docudrama following the heroes that sought out justice against the tyrants responsible for the horrifying tragedy. Inspired by true events, Mark Wahlberg plays police officer Tommy Saunders who's assigned by Commissioner Ed Davis (played by John Goodman) who patrol the street on the morning of the Boston Marathon. What starts off as an exciting day turns into a blistering tragedy at the sound of pressure cooker bombs going off in the crowd. With several casualties and many others rushed to the hospital, Saunders, Davis, along with Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (played by J.K Simmons) must collaborate with FBI agent Richard DesLauriers (played by Kevin Bacon) to hunt down the Muslim terrorists (played by Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze) responsible for the bombing.
Peter Berg rarely pulls punches when re-imagining real-life events on screen (as demonstrated in his previous two films), nor does he take sheer sentimentality for granted which splashes in our faces during the final twenty minutes. And similarly to 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Lone Survivor', Berg effectively present a real-life tragedy into a cinematic entry not geared to entertain, but to tell an honest story of the tragedy that unfolded. This film opens up the night before the tragedy before quickly shifting to the day of the Boston Marathon where the participants and the spectators were gutted with a huge explosion that claims a great number of lives. Although the bombing sequence is highly predictable for those familiar with the event, it does virtually nothing to eliminate the sense of dread and anxiety during the opening minutes of the marathon. Following the gruesome imagery of the debacle, this film ventures through the story of the statewide manhunt after the terrorist involved in the incident. For those who keep an open eye on the news, it is easy predict the final outcome. But the film explores the untold trajectory of the manhunt, and Peter Berg executes the event in a series of pulse-pounding sequences with solidly crafted thrills and shock. Along the way (mostly during the beginning), the story also explores a multiplex of characters connected to the incident including the domestic lives of the terrorists Dzhokhar Tsarneav and his brother Tamerlan Tsnarneav who's sinister motives aren't given too much depth but are thinly hinted through their commentary of America's supposed ""islamophobia"". One of their conversations consists of a 9/11 conspiracy that the government used as a tool for promote hatred Muslims. As jarring as it sounds, it partly accounts the brooding chemistry between these two as they steal the screen in not one, but two incredibly startling scenes during the final third.
Peter Berg populates the story with a wide range of characters that the film rarely breathes any time to develop most of these characters other than Mark Wahlberg's Tommy Saunders and the aforementioned Muslim brothers. But if there is anything keep most of these character breathing with authenticity, it is the cast's solid performances. With Mark Wahlberg teaming up with director Peter Berg for the third time, he steps into the shoes of not a real-life figure but a fictional character inspired by a composite of the real-life heroes involved the seeking of justice. Like in 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Lone Survivor', Wahlberg comes out on screen with a bang. John Goodman, Kevin Bacon, and J.K Simmons also stand very rigid in their roles; though nothing that shouts for powerful memorability considering the underdeveloped characters. Michelle Monaghan provides a decent on screen presence but it sadly left with very little to do other than provide as a filler. Arguably two of the most alarming performances are Alex Wolff and Themo Melikidze who suit up in the roles of nefarious terrorists, and with a competent screenplay are nicely portrayed with legitimacy rather than exploitation. That is doesn't however, reduce how dark and grim nature of their antagonistic characters.
Patriots Day is a riveting tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon Bombing, with an alluring direction by Peter Berg and a story set to inspire. Though it does not shy away the run-of-the-mill tropes of the police drama genre, it effectively breathes life into a story that is set not to necessarily entertain but to inspire.""Kaabil is rich with excellent performances from the entire cast.Hrithik steals the show with his stunning act and screen-presence.His transformation from an innocent lover to a revenge seeker will leave you spell-bound.The easiness with which Hrithik mimics Amitabh Bachchan is a joy to watch.Yami played her role effortlessly....Villains Ronit Roy and Rohit Roy,senior cop Narendra Jha too deserves a special mention.
The story is simple that a blind man takes revenge but with a lot of twist and turns. Rohan, a proficient dubbing artiste and Supriya, a talented pianist--who despite their handicap have a positive disposition towards life. They fall in love and gets married but something tragic happens and their world is destroyed. That's when Ronit Roy and corrupt police officers, played efficiently by Narendra Jha and Girish Kulkarni, drag their feet over the investigation.When the humiliation gets too much to bear, Supriya caves in, leaving Rohan with vendetta on his mind. Here, the film shifts gears and though you know what's next, the cat and mouse game still gives you an adrenaline rush."Nitesh Tiwari has done a fantastic job. The movie is very different from the pretentious glamour that is visible in most Indian films today. It is unique yet relatable. Aamir Khan has once again proved pushed the boundaries for what Indian actors can and must achieve and has left a lasting impression with this work. The stars of the movie remain the two little girls that portray Geeta and Babita. The first half is a master piece. The second half is entertaining but gives in slightly to the dramatic factor that most Indian audience demands of a blockbuster. It is a must watch for anyone who loves Indian cinema. One that you don't want to miss!"I was always going to watch this movie. I saw the video that leaked online but I thought how funny there aren't other videos coming up of the trainers treating the dogs with care. I told my wife I don't care what people are saying I want to watch it. I'm a dog person, always have and always will and when I saw the previews for this movie I was excited. Going in I knew i was going to go through a roller coaster of emotions...and I did. From laughter to sadness I experienced it all. Any movie that can take you on that trip, that can make you emotionally invested to the characters is a GREAT movie in my opinion. I've had my share of heartaches in losing a pet and this movie, in a way gives you a bit of closure. Please, If you are a dog lover do not boycott this movie. You will be missing out on something really beautiful. Forget about what the media is telling you, if you had any interest at any point just go watch it. You will be doing yourself a favor.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One thing that never fails to fascinate me is learning how small ideas become big ones. The stray thought of a writer that inspires a bestselling novel. The chance meeting between two young musicians that ultimately spawns gold records and sold-out tours. The ""a-ha!"" moment that turns a seemingly impossible dream into reality.
One such story is the story depicted in this film. In 1954, Ray Kroc was a struggling restaurant- supply salesman peddling a machine that could make up to five milkshakes at once. Kroc became curious when a small restaurant in southern California placed an order for six of the machines  what kind of business needed to produce 30 milkshakes at once? Intrigued, Kroc paid a visit to the restaurant, an innovative yet unassuming hamburger stand named after its owners, the brothers McDonald. The rest, as they say, is history.
""The Founder"" gives us the meat (pardon the pun) of the McDonald's story, posing some thought-provoking questions along the way. Is success measured merely by a profit margin or the pride and effort a man puts into his work? The film pulls us in different directions, casting differing lights on that question as the story unfolds. In the first half, we want to root for Kroc, the scrappy but hapless salesman who dreams of a better life for himself and his long-suffering wife. We admire his drive as he pushes those around him to understand what makes a McDonald's restaurant different, and at the same time tries to convince the McDonald brothers that their well-intentioned but snail-paced attention to detail is actually holding them back. But by the second half, we realize that we have witnessed the creation of a monster, as do the brothers when they discover that Kroc has essentially stolen their name even as he made it a household name.
The key to ""The Founder"" is Michael Keaton's terrific performance as Ray Kroc, the shake- machine salesman who gradually becomes more of a snake-oil salesman. Yet as the credits roll, the viewer looks back to the beginning of the film and realizes that Keaton was hinting at it all along. In the title role, Keaton is not so much a wolf in sheep's clothing as a sheep who can become a wolf given the right opportunity. The killing blow comes at the very end, when a series of title cards reveals what ultimately became of the people depicted in the film in real life. It's unnerving to say the least, and may even change one's perspective on the entire story.
Credit must also be extended to Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, who play Dick and Mac McDonald, respectively. These actors manage to flesh out two supporting but essential characters. In less capable hands, these roles may have been relegated to mere footnotes in the story, as the real McDonald brothers ultimately became.
To be clear, ""The Founder"" is not a perfect film by any means. The narrative particularly loses steam when we are introduced to Joan Smith, the ambitious, energetic young woman who will ultimately become Kroc's wife. While it's still an important part of the story, it feels shoehorned in, as if screenwriter Robert D. Siegel left it out of an earlier draft and then scrambled to write it back in later.
But for all its faults, ""The Founder"" is still a very good film that tells a uniquely American story. It's recipe, if you will, blends one part Horatio Alger with a dash of Norman Rockwell and a good measure of Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" mixed in. And despite the fact that it necessarily contains a massive amount of product placement, you won't feel hungry for burgers or fries by the time it's done."*** This review may contain spoilers *** Well This Was A Film I've Been Wanting To See For A Long Time I So Wished I Saw This Back In The Year 2000.

There are intense shots which make you live the most pleasant and longest ""cinematic"" of them all. Of course, at times, the scenes turn silly, but non the less the content continues to entertain the audience. I felt like I had emerged into a gameplay on a big screen. The story was easy to follow. And there was also effort put into the main characters. Secondary characters were not given as much attention, but I would love to see more of them in a sequel. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Yet, do not take my opinion, but seek if its of your particular taste.""Now that is a movie that everyone needs to see. It relates the life of three women, but in their tracks the life of millions of blacks who have contributed to American culture and success.
The cast is outstanding, the music off the hook. The cinematography spotless. Dream-like. The right combination of colors and light. A beauty.
It also shows that intelligence connects beyond gender and race. I am referring to the roles - one/played by Costner and 2/ the part of Glenn Allen that show that true intelligence fosters tolerance, and it brings the human race forward.
The story is touching, and it might spark a love for mathematics in you--even if you come from anti-nerd matter!
No need to mention that the trinity Spencer, Monae, Hensen are as bright as the stars they are trying to reach in the movie. Costner true to himself is an incarnation of tolerance and genius as i remembered him in the Bodyguard. And the guy who plays Glenn Allen is candy for the eye: these two remind us that there are some nice folks out there--and that intelligence breaks all barriers.
Truly stimulating for the mind--one of the best movie I have seen lately (after SPOTLIGHT, same level)
This movie deserves all possible awards;for it is just ""avant-garde"", in the style, the content, and the strength it oozes!
Came out the day of my birthday--Epiphany. That has to mean something! Support that gem of a movie!""This movie is Nitesh's best movie. Dangal became the finest movie of year 2016 in Bollywood.
The execution and direction of the movie is superb. It shows the mindset of the people in villages (and most of the part of India) who thinks that daughter is just Load to their family and have only place for house Hold work. Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir's character) fight all the odds and train his daughters to be professional wrestlers. The movie also brings the mindset of the India Parents, that they can chose the future of their children and prepare them for it.
Movie don't take much time to collect and start the story. The in-depth story of the daughters training session is very interesting and you will get attached to it. Action sequences of Geetha's matches are very well executed in early age and later the professional matches. The only disappointed part in the movie is to bring the NSA coach as bad character who conspire to put Mahavir in a room while Geetha play final match. Movie picks a Melodrama (wasn't necessary) at that stage.
Overall performance: 8/10""I chose to watch this movie because of the review rating (8.2/10) and the actors. I'm so glad I did! This movie is slow but slow in a way that is thought provoking. I can understand how there are some reviews about it being boring, but really it's not. It was refreshing to not see a cheesy alien movie...which I was expecting. There is no unnecessary fighting, over the top special effects, or sex. I suggest watching this movie if you enjoy a story that takes time but always keeps you thinking of what's to come. There are so many things to reflect on in this movie. Plus, the actors were great! I'm very impressed with the variety of roles Amy can play. If you're looking for thought provoking sci-fi, this is a great one!""For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.
But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have.""This is an amazing fantasy drama. It's one of the best films I've seen in a while. Definitely go watch it.
This is not a children's film and this is not a horror film. This is a drama about coping with loss of loved ones. Children will probably be scared by some scenes and the rest of it they'll probably not understand.
From a technical standpoint, it's a triumph. The cinematography is not just mere background. Everything plays its role. I am very keen to see what this director will offer us next.
You will weep, you will smile. This film will touch you in ways you never thought possible. It's a masterpiece.""Hacksaw Ridge is the true story, told the Mel Gibson way, of Desmond Doss. He is the soldier who won a Medal of Honor in WWI and never touched a single weapon. Without giving too much of this story away, I'll just say his story was masterfully told in this superb movie.
Finally, there is a movie which deserves Oscar attention. Andrew Garfield is wonderful in this movie. Gibson does an outstanding job directing and the final product does the story so much justice. Hacksaw Ridge ranks with the best war movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.
The first half tells the story about how he came to the decision not to ever hold a weapon and his conviction to his commitment even though ridiculed, and the second half tells the story of his heroics at war without a weapon, when everyone else has one.
I highly recommend the film. If you can take the violence of war movies, this great story will not disappoint. Everyone nominated for this film deserves the recognition.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** From the mind of J.K. Rowling comes ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them,"" an amazing tale of the adventures of a young wizard (perfectly played by Eddie Redmayne) who goes to NYC in the 1920s in order to retrieve and find homes for fantastic, magical beasts that would otherwise be destroyed by the wizarding community.
Redmayne will face many serious hurdles during his mission: not knowing how to navigate NYC (specifically Manhattan); being unfamiliar with the rules of the wizard community in NY; both wizards and non-wizards fearing the fantastic beasts and wanting them destroyed; and the wizarding community not sanctioning his search, capture, and release (into safe zones) of the beasts.
A larger threat is a powerful force that wreaks destruction and death in NYC, threatening to unveil the wizarding world to the normal humans. A fantastic, magical beast is blamed; and Redmayne has little time left to prove to the wizards that the cause of the mayhem is some other, supernatural force. If Redmayne fails at what he must do, a war between normal humans and wizards may erupt; and all the fantastic beasts in Redmayne's care will be destroyed.
My most memorable, movie moment of ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Redmayne and his wizard friend/love interest are sentenced to death, and we see the manner in which the execution is carried out. The executioners mention that it won't hurt, but I think it will!
""FBAWTFT"" was much better than I anticipated, and it is a very good companion piece to the ""Harry Potter"" movies. But it does suffer from two huge plot holes -- or shenanigans, as I like to call it -- that cannot be easily dismissed. The wizards have the power to reverse any damage to property, and remove memories of magical experiences by normal humans. In addition, the wizards can wreak such havoc upon the world and there is very little that the normal humans can do about it. One wizard can probably destroy a small country in a day. So why do the wizards fear having their existence revealed, and some possible war against the normal humans happening?
Mannysmemorablemoviemoments""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A few years ago; Mathew McConaughey got a well deserved acting Oscar for a must see movie called ""The Dallars Buyers Club"" ( that deserved the best picture Oscar too but was not even nominated) about the greed of the medical industry and their lobby on government that affected life of many people. This time he fully committed (and few actors dare to sacrifice their physical image portraying a mediocre egocentric, selfish and drunk gold digger) sadly the movie does not reach the level of Mr McConaughey acting skills and sacrifice.
The basic story is about a mediocre mine searcher that after almost ruining his family company; in a last attempt to success and squeezing his last resources; find a Geologist (the always reliable Edgar Ramirez) and together find a gold mine in Indonesia. The finding looks very promising so all people that never trust him (Banks and Investment companies) start helping him but only to take control of his project; and ultimate steal it from him.
He is able to fight them back and recover until an unexpected twist change things again (if you do not know the real events it will surprise you).
The movie is ""inspired by true events"" which basically means only few points are real; however the most important facts are real.
The movie does not try to be historically accurate; just to show how small companies are used, betrayed and destroyed by the financial marketers in order to protect the biggest corporations and most important how at the end; only the small investors (basically the common people) are the ones that lose their life savings deceived by those ""legal scams"".
It is a pity Stephen Gaghan (the director who also directed SYRIANA) did not dig more on the intricacies of the gold market and the big scam it really involves instead on focusing on a hideous character that become just a little likable only because Mathew outstanding effort.
There are a few great actors in the movie; aside from the outstanding Ramirez, Stoll is very good as the financial adviser with his own agenda and Bryce Dallas Howard as the suffering girlfriend. A very underwritten character that is however important for the movie.
In brief; it is not explosive as SYRIANA or important as DALLAS BUYER CLUB; but still a must see movie.""I actually reactivated my account to post this review. While this movie is by no means a thinker's movie, I found it to be a very fun watch! Don't listen to these other reviews and give it a try - you won't be sorry.
For people who can enjoy movies like the Hangover at the right times, give this one a go. I stumbled onto this movie on Netflix right when it was put up, and got hooked watching it. The narrative is similar to Crash in that its a story that is told in pieces, only to be slowly pieced together as the movie goes on. However, the plot is similar to Harold and Kumar. Lots of funny characters, with actors that put on a genuinely enjoyable performance.
Enjoy the surprises!
Definitely would recommend!""After seeing this film the trending tab of Netflix I decided I would check it out on IMDb, at first I saw many negative reviews (ranging from about 0/10 to 1/10).
I couldn't be bothered to find something else so I watched it. Definitely exceeded expectations and above.
If you watch the first 58 seconds and don't laugh this movie is not for you as this defying moment of the film as it sums up the entire movie. Definitely give the first minute a try.
PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS! (people don't know how to enjoy a fun, just weird film like this)""As an Altair and Ezio Auditore's follower, is quite hard for me to give bad feedback about Assassins Creed. The plot is superbly well-made, with a story that mixes historical facts with technology. It's quite futuristic but it makes us think about serious stuff like ""Are the Templars descendents alive, amongst us?"" and ""What are they planning for Mankind?"". Fassbender does a great Callum Lynch/Aguilar with great physical performance and acting skill. Marion Cotillard keeps up with his pace. The scenarios are well designed and this movie has the ability of making us travel in time. The only negative point is related to the movie duration. Such a rich story should deserve a trilogy, so that the viewer could understand the Order of the Assassins' organization through time.""Grief was a prominent theme at the movies in 2016, but no movie has tackled that anger and helplessness quite like ""A Monster Calls,"" this year, or ever. Using magical realism in familiar but effective ways, ""A Monster Calls"" breaks down the pain and guilt of loss and suffering in a way that's accessible for younger audiences yet authentic to adult experiences.
Adapted for the screen by Patrick Ness from his own novel and brought to life by J.A. Bayona (""The Impossible,"" ""The Orphanage""), ""A Monster Calls"" tells the story of a 12-year-old Conor (Lewis MacDougall), a daydreamer who loves to draw, is bullied at school and whose single mother (Felicity Jones) is extremely ill. Beaten down by life, Conor is paid a visit by a massive monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) that emerges from the nearby yew tree despite Conor's pleas to be left alone. The monster tells Conor that he will visit him three times and tell him three stories, and the fourth time, Conor will tell him a story, a story that will reveal the truth, a truth of which he is very afraid.
The film bounces between real-life scenarios in which Conor must deal with his worsening mother, strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and even his estranged father (Toby Kebbell) visiting from America, with encounters from the monster after midnight each night at 12:07. As one would expect, these fantastical episodes reflect and inform Conor's everyday drama and emotions.
""A Monster Calls"" is at its most captivating in the imaginative sequences featuring the monster and his stories, especially toward the beginning before the real-world story picks up steam. These digital water color animated fairy tales, especially their editing and visualization, provide a tremendous boost in energy that draws us further into the story as a whole despite the fact that they technically digress from the plot. They also provide young viewers with a familiar story structure to convey important morals and messages that pertain to Conor's experiences, messages normally too complicated for fairy tales.
Ness' story (based on an idea by Siobhan Dowd) personifies emotions and inner struggle in a way not all that dissimilar from Pixar's ""Inside Out."" The monster guides Conor and teaches him lessons, but he is also a projection of Conor's subconscious that embodies his feelings of rage and inner torment. Through the monster, Conor learns how to express himself during this tumultuous time. Thankfully, the adults on the receiving end of his real-world expressions respond in productive ways.
Conor's mother, grandmother and father have flaws and challenges that affect Conor in different ways, but Ness makes sure they don't provide even greater obstacles for him to overcome. It's enough for a character to navigate the family dynamics at play when someone is dying, to throw in the complications of an adult who makes things worse might be more true to life, but would distract from the core messages the film is trying to transmit. Still, Jones, Weaver and Kebbell can show how their characters are struggling too and not simply be perfect rocks for Conor to lean on.
MacDougall also has a lot of promise as a young actor. This is a part that requires a lot of emotion and yet a lot of restraint. He must have enough imagination to add to the magical scenes and enough of a grip on reality too. Viewers of all ages must also be able to see part of themselves in Conor to empathize rather than just sympathize with him. MacDougall absolutely keeps us engaged emotionally as the film unfolds.
""A Monster Calls"" is an emotional film punctuated with the spark of imagination, one that combines beauty and fantasy with tragedy in a way similar to Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth."" It's not all that discrete in what it's doing or how it operates, but the intent behind it and the truth about the world that it wants to address is too admirable and important to dismiss. More than anything else, if ""A Monster Calls"" helps just one parent and child talk about grief, loss, guilt or anger it will have justified its entire production. More people just need to see it, and it undoubtedly will.

Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Cinema has always been defined by the war films. Whether it'd be World War I, World War II, Vietnam, or even more modern battles, the war film has always ruled the academy awards. Several war films, such as: Patton, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, and the Hurt Locker have all won best picture. Hacksaw Ridge is promising to continue that trend with an amazing movie that can absolutely win the best picture award.
Some of the greatest war films are: Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, The Hurt Locker, All Quiet on the Western Front, and Fury. Hacksaw Ridge has easily supplanted itself into that list. Mel Gibson gives us an amazing experience that is almost on par with his previous work, Braveheart.
The story of Hacksaw Ridge is the true story of Desmond T. Doss. Like most young men of the early 1940s, he wants to volunteer to serve his country in the now escalating World War II. However, due to his religious beliefs, Doss cannot touch a gun. Because of this, he is immediately deemed a coward, and is treated with great prejudice. However, thanks to the efforts of his father, Doss is allowed to go into battle without a single weapon to protect himself. Doss is sent to Okinawa, and he is forced to save as many as he can without a weapon. The story of Hacksaw Ridge is basically divided into two halves, with the first half being about his life, dealing with his adversity while also simultaneously finding the love of his life. The second half of the film is Doss on the front lines of the battle, saving lives while his comrades try to achieve victory. The story is very well done and does not seem to be slow.
The performances in this film are some of the best in any war film. Andrew Garfield gives the performance of his life as Desmond T. Doss, and makes us truly want to cheer for him. Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington also give fantastic performances, and both give the audience some very memorable Quote: s. All the supporting characters are great, giving this film, in my opinion, a perfect cast.
One of the most memorizing aspects of this film is the brutal war scenes that take up the entire second half of the film. This film does not advertise war as great, it truly makes us believe that war is unbearable. The war scenes are brutal, violent, and amazingly shot. These are the most disturbing war scenes since the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Mel Gibson did a very commendable job at making these scenes both realistic and violent.
To sum up this review, Hacksaw Ridge, in my opinion, is the best movie of 2016. With a perfect cast, great story and fantastic cinematography, Hacksaw Ridge has supplanted itself as one of the greatest war movies of all time. In my opinion, on par with Saving Private Ryan and Platoon (which are my two favorite war movies). Hacksaw Ridge, absolutely gets a 10/10!!!""One of 'The' best films I have seen in some time. James McAvoy is incredible with his portrayal of this complex character. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film and not once did I relax as the story-line was gripping and intense. I have never written a review before but felt compelled to comment due to my intense enjoyment of this film. M. Night Shyamalan is a master of suspense and intrigue and I have enjoyed so many of his films, but this is absolutely the best so far. Both the director and James deserve some recognition for this and it would be a travesty if this was passed by, its an outstanding piece of work.
If you haven't seen it, don't miss it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The themes that Silence has for this three-hour film includes apostasy,the persecution of Japanese Christians, the love of the Japanese people for their culture and many others about Christianity and imperialism.One theme that stands out would definitely be about God's nature together with the difference between human nature and divine nature as the film's was basically based upon it.
Director Martin Scorsese co-wrote the script with Jay Cocks tells a story of two Portuguese priests -Fathers Francisco Garupe and Sebastião Rodrigues - who travel to Japan in search for a missing priest - Father Cristóvão Ferreira,who was sent there to preach Catholicism,was reported to be dead.Both are accompanied by Japanese alcoholic named Kichijiro.
The story was evidently too long.It tried to present various themes as I previously mentioned that required many scenes such as the killing of the Japanese Christians;the Japanese soldiers explaining to Father Garupe on why they did this during the priest's capture;the presentation of Father Ferreira,who apparently has apostatized and has turned into Japanese Buddhist,as well as his conversation with Father Garupe when the latter was sent in jail; and the apostasy of Father Garupe,who turned out to become like his fellow priest,until his death.
I felt that the reason for having a long film was required to tackle the numerous themes it tried to present.But too bad that the film fell short in doing so as many scenes became boring and redundant particularly Father Garupe's indecision whether to give up his Christian faith or not.In addition to that,God's divine nature wasn't really fully explored during the Ferreira-Garupe talks for the reasons of Garupe to apostatize in the end was simply found to be minor.Overall,I felt that Scorsese missed scoring another great film in it to be included among his works.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The next franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes with mystical and magical powers in 'Doctor Strange', which is a damn good start to this new character. 'Doctor Strange' was created by Steve Ditko and first appeared in Strange Tales #110 back in 1963. 'Doctor Strange' or Stephen Strange is a highly intelligent surgeon who is in the top of his field. In an accident, he loses the use of his hands, which leads him to seek out alternate methods of healing. This brings him to a mystical and magical place across the globe where he meets 'The Ancient One' amongst other sorcerers that help him heal spiritually and physically.
Whatever Strange had learned or knew before this, is out the window, as he learns of other worlds, universes, and powers beyond imagination. Soon enough, Strange has to help defend Earth, much like 'The Avengers' do, but on a different scale. While 'The Avengers' keep us safe from big monstrous physical threats on Earth, 'Doctor Strange' protects us from magical and mystical threats from other worlds  which in due time, we will see everyone come together and team up to fight some evil forces. At least I hope. Filmmaker Scott Derrickson was chosen to direct 'Doctor Strange', which seems like a ""strange"" (all the pun intended) decision given his resume, which includes mostly horror movies  'Deliver Us From Evil' and 'Sinister' to name a few, but it turned out to be a great decision along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, who was formally a film critic from AintItCoolNews, who co-wrote this film.
The result is simply fantastic and a great start to the 'Doctor Strange' universe. Derrickson and Cargill have done a swell job in conjuring up a great origin story and executing each character's development here. From showing what kind of man Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was to his transformation to the superhero we see later on  it all works. Cumberbatch is excellent too here, hitting all of the right emotional notes as well as performing the physical aspects of the role nicely. The script has a slow burn approach to it in the first half of the film, but is sprinkled with excellent comic bits and action sequences. This slower approach is necessary to really connect and feel for Strange and it works out perfectly, as if you went on this powerful journey together.
The only gripe I have, and mind you, it's a small one, is the relationship between Strange and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), which feels rushed and tiresome, as it's been done before. Perhaps, there just wasn't enough time to really dig deep into it. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo was excellent and almost had a 'Serenity' quality to him, but was a very conflicted character, and he performed that very well. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius was also fun to watch, but not the best villain w've seen. His makeup looked great and he did a great job, but there needed to be something more from him. Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One was perfect for her role and Benedict Wong as Wong stole every scene he was in.
The visual effects were out of this world as some of the bigger action sequences had things I've never seen before in a movie. It was done on such a grand scale too that I was entranced in everything going on through the film. Now I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you have the option, see 'Doctor Strange' in 3D. The visuals are insanely good and it was indeed filmed with 3D IMAX cameras, and not converted like most movies are these days. It simply looks phenomenal. I can't wait for more 'Doctor Strange'.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** *Spoiler alert* I have never written the review before but now I have to. The reason is simple, unnecessary hate from critics and viewers.
Firstly, many reasons may cause the ""film disaster"" like marketing of the film(a lot of spoilers in the trailer mainly), Warner Brothers pressure to make not only BvS movie but prequel to JL,theatrical cut, and huge expectation from fans. I understand that the fans could have been disappointed after watching the theatrical cut but that was the fault of WB, they've just cut off many important and essential scenes etc, so don't blame Zack Snyder for everything. Maybe panicking or competing with Marvel caused this?
OK, I'm going to write only about ultimate cut. This movie shows something new, it shows how humanity would threat the superman. At first we would admire him and then start to feel helpless, because of his big strength. This is displayed in performance of Batman and Lex Luthor who created ""Doomsday"". The first part of the movie focuses on their motivations, Batman raising rage, Superman's investigation of Batman,Lex Luthor mad plan. Step by step Luthor pushed them into their fight and his back-up was Doomsday( I would prefer if they included f.e. Metallo but nah never mind). As I mentioned the first half was about their motivations, also new Batman was introduced.
Some people ask, why Batman is killing in this film. The answer is simple. In this time line, Batman was fighting the criminals about 20 years, a lot of good people were gone, so he became the dark night of the streets with more brutal attitudes. The process took very long time it was not like ""ok from today I don't give a f*ck about my not- killing rule."" And many issues can be explained if viewers pay attention to the movie, especially to the ultimate cut.
The second part. In this part we can see two fights. Superman and Batman. Many people complain and ask, why Batman wins.Here is a list: a) Superman didn't want to kill him. b) Batman used Kryptonite c) Batman was prepared
If superman wanted to kill him, probably it would take 5 seconds. Superman had no clue about Kryptonite. Batman was preparing for long time, he developed his weapons. He didn't create bullets from Kryptonite, but only gus, which he did because he didn't want a short fight, and he wanted to Superman suffer before his death. As I said the ultimate cut solved a lot of problems.
""Martha scene"" I must mention it. Saying Martha to Batman it doesn't change his intend to kill you but the fact that Martha is his Earth mother does. In that moment he realized he is like his own enemies, like the murder who killed his parents that night. It is so simple to understand that but people are still b*tching about it.
The trinity fight with Doomsday was excellent. Wonder woman was the part even Superman has his own highlight scenes. He survived the blast of the nuclear bomb and then he ""killed"" Doomsday.
Overall this movie was pretty good, Batflack, Wonder Woman and even Superman (in the ultimate cut) were good done. Another pluses were the opening scene, the mankind problem with Superman, spectacular fights(both), visual orgasm, MUSIC etc.
My only problems were cast for Lex Luthor, even though this actor will probably show us the true Luthor in the next films. And the fact that they wanted everything in one movie. They should have made MOS2 and then Justice League but never mind at least we don't have wait another years for Justice League. And very IMPORTANT fact, this movie wasn't about Batman or Superman or their epic fight but about changing their directions from the point where the film started and to the very end. f.e. Batman. During the movie he represents the broken man, angry, full of bad previous experience of people of Gotham, he even thought that superman is evil. Then he realized the truth and in the first place he was effected by Superman heroic sacrifice, which let him to change his mind and starting to create Justice League. Superman is another example. Humans started to fell fear from his power( very good interpretation of human nature), then he learnt Batman's methods and the truth about Lex Luthor and his evil plan. And at the end he sacrificed himself which ispired a lot of people around the globe. AND PLEASE DON'T JUDGE movie before it came out.""That's some terrifying stuff right there! Fashion designer Tom Ford has written and directed his second movie, a multifaceted revenge thriller which is even better than his first, 2009's ""A Single Man"".
Both are visually stylish, of course, which is expected from fashion guru, both have interesting premise and good actors, and both have this cold, unsettling atmosphere which tries to keep the viewer at some distance.
In short, Ford has managed to take everything good from his solid debut project and bring it to the next level with ""Nocturnal Animals"". It's more lively, gripping, effortlessly cool and deeper.
There are two stories, interwined in a way which may make viewers wonder whether it's real or imagined by the character. But it is ambiguous in a best possible way, not trying to f--k with our minds and then leave us hanging.
An unhappily married woman (Amy Adams) thinks she wants his first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) back. And she reads his novel, a violent thriller, which seems like a revenge tale. And then things get more, er, complex.
On-screen events are exciting already but Ford the writer turns out surprisingly skillful at making it even varied, without getting stuck or losing steam, or letting us think that we know where all this ends up. He even playfully takes jabs at his main fashion job and the lifestyle and personal sacrifices that come with it.
And the whole result really makes you feel something for the characters, unlike many of the thrillers that only manage to arouse the viewer during their best bits.
It's not mostly about Adams and Gyllenhaal. There is a number of smaller but important characters and cool performances. We have Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney.
The cast is good enough reason to watch it. Everybody adds something worthwhile to the experience, even Sheen and Fisher and especially Linney who all have rather small roles used to move the story along.
Shannon brings his usual magnetic mix of cool and creepy. Gyllenhaal manages to move between having balls and ball-less state without turning unbelievable or too heroic. Taylor-Johnson as the bad guy even got a Golden Globe for his work (the only one for the movie although Tom Ford got nominated for both best movie / drama and adapted screenplay). He really deserves it, he is evil at its most subtle and delicious. Delicious to watch, I mean.
But I am especially happy about Amy Adams who is often used in the movies as just a pretty face or supporting woman. In 2016, she has had two strong roles, in a thinking man's sci-fi ""Arrival"", and now this.
Her screen time may be limited but she surely makes the most of it, captivatingly playing out both worlds that the character has hiding inside her. I believed her both as a lively young woman and the jaded older one that's missing all the ideals that she had decided to throw away long time ago.
Based on a novel by Austin Wright which Ford wanted to adapt into two movies initially, one true to original, the other not so much. I am not sure which way he chose ultimately but what a ride, eh?
PS No, I am not giving 9 out of 10 to every movie I watch from now on. The last three have been just some of 2016's best of the best.""I don't know about the rest of people writing reviews here, but I am older generation of ""kids"" :) I remember when Disney was at his prime, and their movies ware fun, entertaining, full of joy and good singalong songs. For a long time, Disney was not that...new-generation directors, storytellers, cartoon artists and many others lost touch with old traditional good movies. They experimented with different styles of telling stories, but there was not successful in that, and Disney lost that charm that it had. This movie returned me my young self, with all the songs, breathtaking and funny moments. You go through roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to the end of movie, and it is so perfectly composed into one great unity.
I agree, there ware some songs and tones of movie that ware kinda out of place, but you ""survive"" it, and already in next scene, you forgot about it, and you can enjoy in new incredible views that this movie provides.
When I first heard of main casting, I was a little skeptical of ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, because, I was under the impression that Hollywood is pushing him into a lot of movies, just to earn more money, and this was one of them. BUT, although he is GREAT actor (proven him self a lot of times), he was PERFECT for this part. He is ""Maui"", he was so merged with that character, you can envision him in movie.
As for the technical aspect of animation, there can only be words of praise and great-job-done! Water, hair, colors, hand-body and rest of movement ware so good done, that it could be said it is lifelike.
All in all, I love that Disney decided to return to it's roots, and brought us warm-cliché-loving movies that we all appreciate and need. There are new generation kids that need this kind of movies, because, we are drowning in too much reality shows, dramas, tragedy's and shallow-minded ""comedies"". For me, a great movie is the one that is re-watchable again and again, and whenever it comes to TV, you sit and watch it again, and not the movies that after once watched, you never come back and watch it again. This one goes to RE-WATCHABLE category. Thank you Disney.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A thoughtful and compelling film that stays just this side of unbelievable. Great visuals, strong acting and a surprising anti- corporate sense of humor. No icky aliens or extended space warfare scenes, this is pure drama and romance that also wrestles with several moral dilemmas. Special mention goes to Michael Sheen who plays the compassionate if robotic bartender and inadvertently triggers the unraveling of the main character's secret. Most of the movies I've seen on the big screen over the last ten years have been disappointments that made me feel I'd wasted the ticket price. Not this one, I've now seen it twice and might go back again.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie Son of Saul is a religious movie about a little, 11 year old boy who actually survives the blast of gas inside the gas chambers in the Second World War. He is lifted out of the corpses of naked bodies and is put on a table. A man listens and hears his breathe - in and out - inhale and exhale. This is like the breathe that God breathes into Adam in order to create man. This breathe is very significant and represents all of human life. Saul understands this meaning and wants a religious leader to mark this miracle - of surviving the holocaust ovens and breathing outside the gates of hell. Saul searches for a rabbi. It is unclear in the movie if a rabbi is found, as I do not have enough knowledge of what being a rabbi entails. Saul did find someone who I think could have been a rabbi - but the burial for the small boy who survived the gas chambers was never completed to the end. There was an attempt made but then they had to flee again. I believe that the boy transformed into a German Spy when he was left to drown - half alive in the river. The river must have awoken the boy and he went to where Saul was hiding to witness him one more time. Saul was then delusional and thought the young boy was wearing Nazi clothes and a informer - but this was the holy child not an informant. Saul was hallucinating. In the end Saul gets shot to death - but not without giving up, withdrawing and being internally defeated first.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** As a classical singer and voice teacher I can only commend Ms. Streep for her work as a very bad classical singer who thinks she is a very good classical singer. It is difficult enough to sing those arias well, but amazingly difficult to purposely sing them poorly. Streep manages to mimic the unfortunate sounds of Mrs. Foster Jenkins, down to the off-kilter semi-tones and shrill production. Go have a listen to Mrs. Foster Jenkins on YouTube and you will see what a job Ms. Streep had of it, and how well she did in achieving an excellent imitation of the unique sound this woman possessed.
I might also mention that Hugh Grant is at his handsomest and most endearing in his role. I could look at him all day!
Brava Meryl Streep, you deserve and Oscar for what you did in this movie! 10 out of 10.""There is very little I can add to the very good reviews posted by others here over the years. I first saw this movie shortly after it came out, and I've watched it again periodically since.
What surprises me are the reviews that state that the ending is ""contrived"" or doesn't connect with the main plot, or whatever. I don't get these criticisms. The ending is what makes the entire movie.
Today, with all the news about hacking by the Russians in the recent election, this movie seems relevant again, even though the Soviet Union no longer exists. The constant threat posed by ""Yuri"" throughout the movie should resonate well with today's viewers.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Did anyone expect this 2014 action thriller to be a success? The film took audiences and critics by storm with its exciting and tense action sequences, a strong leading performance by ""The Matrix"" star Keanu Reeves as well as a talented supporting cast, a simple yet memorable plot and masterful direction.
Keanu Reeves does what he does best in this smashing success: speak little dialogue and kick ass by shooting and killing the bad guys. Playing a former hit-man who is thrown back into the game after young punks kill his beloved puppy dog and steal his car, Reeves is on top of his game. The actor brings his own A-game to the part as he plays the title character as brooding, mysterious and intelligent all rolled into a lethal combination. Reeves' John Wick is a man on a mission and is prepared with a deadly arsenal of weaponry to dispatch his enemies.
The film also boasts a talented supporting cast particularly from Michael Nyqvist as Russian mob boss, Viggo, Ian McShane as Wick's former boss, Winston (the actor will reprise his role in the sequel) and Willem Dafoe as Wick's old friend and ally, Marcus. The actors all bring their unique flavors from Nyqvist being a quietly sinister villain who will take down Reeves's John Wick at any cost, McShane brings a worldly wisdom and silent ruthlessness to keep his prize assassin alive and Dafoe brings his snarky quips and loyal friendship to Marcus who is unwilling to kill his old friend which of course leads to trouble. You can never predict what action some of the characters will take or where their true loyalties lie, but it is thrilling to watch and wait for.
The actions sequences are relentless and fast-paced without resorting to shaky cam tactics. Guns fire, blood flies, fisticuffs ensue, the colors are dark and vibrant and the motions are all frenetic. The stunts are well choreographed as the actors move through fight scenes with almost snake-like slickness while the camera angles are wide enough for us to take in the action and relish all the excitement.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** An ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him. Over the last few years actor Keanu Reeves had both his ups and downs and he has made some pretty awful films but also some pretty enjoyable but nothing is enjoyable as much as John Wick a character that even Liam Neeson would be afraid of, i mean seriously how can i explain how freaking amazing this film looks and sounds like? Great characters, great acting, cool soundtrack and amazing action sequences that will blow your mind and of course it ends with a hint on a sequel which is coming out next month 'John Wick Part 2' in my opinion this film deserves it's place next to films such as Die Hard, Equalizer, Commando, First Blood and more because it's not just enjoyable but it's also pretty amazing in every scale that you could even imagine.""This movie after I saw it went straight to my top 5 movies ever, maybe the top one, I don't know, certainly it's in my forever top 5! Daniels created an original movie, never seen before anything like that. A really smart and beautiful script, from which, in my opinion, every line is a Quote: . The script deals basic with friendship and true love, wherever it comes from. It includes comedy, drama, musical, action, and sci-fi, all of them used harmoniously and came to impressive results. The directing was spectacular. The image was eye-catching, with wild and beautiful scenery.The actors played a very serious part to this result. They gave life to the script in a higher than any expectation way. Personally I think Daniel Radcliffe is one of the best actors of his generation. He did a really tough work in this movie. Playing all the time an almost dead man, I was impressed. This guy is a true actor. In every movie there is nothing that reminds my of him in any other role. He is really transforming himself. This was the first movie I ever saw Paul Dano and I think I need to see and other stuff he has done, because his was really good, different from the classic style of American actors, with beautiful and true gaze. Oh last but not least, the music. There is a music pattern used repeatedly in the movie but it is changing in the way.I loved the fact that the most of the parts are sang by Paul and Daniel. It was not only a detail but a contributing factor to the end result.
I really loved the result. Great and never seen before!!! Congratulations to the hole team! You must watch this movie, you really have to!""Camp Xray is very beautifully acted ,directed ,shoted and composed movie . A story that needed to be told , it reveals the emotional aspect of Detainee and Guard of Guantanamo Bay . Which is indeed a very interesting thing to put on big screen .
It does carry a strong message and in present that in a very beautiful emotional way .
Kstew always been entitled as emotionless actress , but her recent work has shown us she is a very potential actress , but it all started back then in 2014 with Camp Xray .
But real star is Peyman Moaadi, heart-touching performance. Just brilliant.
Don't miss this brilliant cinematic flick at any cost .""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is one of those movies that is simple and yet has quite a bit of depth to it. In fact the depth when it comes to the social commentary in this is quite effective and yet entertaining to watch. This is one of my favorite John Carpenter film that really got my attention even when watching it as a kid. The societal study of covert factious regime is the main factor at it's core that drives this story. With deep messages on being blinded by the media, entertainment and what politicians has to say. All are manifestations created by aliens to subdue and control the human race. It's actually compelling. Sure it has the B movie vibe going for it and can be corny at times but the corniness actually makes this more of a fun ride. Instead of it being overly serious and dark, it's corny and yet ingenious. I also liked it's portrayal of how the poor are quicker to see things for they really are. While the rich and people with status only care about controlling others and taking advantage of people. And only does things when there is something in it for them. So I found it ironic when most of the aliens were people that work in the entertainment industry, media coverage and politics. The subtle parts when the characters get headaches when they see and hear the truth for a period of time to add to the satire. Even one of the scenes that show a long fight between two friends near a dumpster has a meaning to it. Because the main protagonist is trying with all his might for his friend to see the truth for what it really is. And how society lacks integrity and can easily be bribed for position of power and wealth. While succumbing to turning a blind eye to the truth in the process. So overall, this is a movie I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys films in general and not just science fiction fans. Because before ""The Matrix"" there was this cult classic masterpiece.
10/10""War films are a dime a dozen, which is strange considering the amount of money and effort it must take to make them, but something about The Thin Red Line sets it up above (most of) the rest, and that might be its message.
Set during World War 2, the film follows the capture of a strategic location atop a hill controlled by the Japanese. The action flows fiercely from start to finish, punctuated by lulls between the chaos. It is the most intense and violent of Malick's films, yet he seems perfectly comfortable in this new territory.
The cinematography is gorgeous, providing a visual irony to the gritty and hellish nature of war. The score is also fantastic, with a spine-tingling indigenous chant that has become a trademark sound of the film. The dialogue is thoughtful and philosophical, with Malick's trademark ramblings on the nature of life, humanity, and the universe.
There is something to take home from The Thin Red Line and that is the awful nature of war and violence. It's interesting, in that Malick provides a beautiful film on war, but you must pause and meditate on the actions of the characters and their words for Malick's true message to come through.
This film was made almost 20 years after Days of Heaven, possibly the longest hiatus any filmmaker has taken. A-list actors were lining up to work with Malick when he came out of his cave and announced his plans for TTRL, so drenched in mystique he was. Some high profile celebrities that did shoot for the film did not even make it in the final cut.
A mystical and haunting look at war from an artist who fully embraces the spiritual nature of his films. Top work from a top director.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** According to director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, the idea of making a horror movie about children seeing ghost; first came to him, while watching an old 1990's Nickelodeon show called 'Are You Afraid of the Dark: titled, 'Tale of the Dream Girl"" (1994), directed by David Winning. Hoping to capitalize on that success, he wrote and pitch a similar idea to studios as a kid movie, until rewrites made the script's subject matter, more mature and harder to sell. That's until, the most unlikeable of sources, came to him, looking to buy it, which was Walt Disney Studios. It seem that then-president of production, David Vogel read Shyamalan's spec script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the high price tag of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. While, Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and apparently show little confidence in the film value, by selling the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining a few distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office receipt. They still greenlit the project and gave their share. Lucky for them, the film was the biggest jackpot gamble win of all time, becoming one of biggest box-office hits of the 1990s. The reasons, why everybody loves it, are very clear. The film's chilly astrosphere, acting, and unexpected twist ending are some of the best moments, cinema can give you. It was a very memorable movie from a then-unknown director. The story of redemption was also great, with 'Six Sense' telling the story of a once-prideful disheartened child psychologist, Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), dedicated himself, by trying to cure a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) from being traumatic by the spirits of the dead. Without spoiling the movie, too much, after watching this film the first time through without spoilers, it is almost impossible to watch it again without seeing obvious foreshadowing, during the second watch. Still, this movie has a lot of rewatch value. I love how the movie has a Hitchcockism/Kubrickism feel to it, as there was a lot of carefully devised storytelling, going on here with the visuals without using too much dialogue. Some great examples are, how the color red was prominent whenever the worlds of the living and the dead came together, follow by visible cold breathing and shivers. Wonderful use of foreshadowing. Added to the tension that is already brought by the wonderful make up effects, sound mixing and haunting soundtrack by composer, James Newton Howard. Another brilliant example of visuals using as foreshadowing, is how everybody's clothes seem heavy wore, their normal hair seem a bit grey/white, and how they barely interact with their surroundings. I like how the filmmaker were very careful, not to spoil the clues of the true state of any of the characters, too much. They were even worry that Cole's iconic, and highly Quote: d, revealed at the hospital might have spoil the movie for everybody. Lucky for them, most of the audience still, didn't see the twist coming. Another magnificent thing, Shyamalan does well is using reflecting surfaces such as glasses, mirrors, windows, and other reflecting surfaces for a slew of dramatic and thematic reasons. You really get to see, good examples of that, whenever, Malcolm is looking at his depressed wife, Anna (Olivia Williams). Nevertheless, perhaps the best shot in the film, at least for me, was the extreme close-up of the bright silver door knob in the 3rd act with a distorted image of Cole. It was both scary and clear transparent to a positive change. It's great to see, a horror movie, that doesn't end with a downer. Another great use by the director, was the idea of using long take to establish important character relations. We see this, compositional strategy, during the first official meeting between Cole and Malcolm. Not only, does it build a special bond between the two leads, but it gives the impression that Cole's mother, Lynn (Toni Collette) and Malcolm were perhaps are at the end of a conversation about him. Almost tricking the audience. Nevertheless, if they did talk, the dialogue would had been cheesy. As much, as I love, everybody acting, particular Osment. Some of the lines, they were given to say, were a bit silly. A good example of this, was any of the scenes with Lynn and Cole. Seeing them, argue and later, embrace in the car about a Bumble-bee Pen felt a little odd and humorous. It wasn't as intimacy as it should be for me. Still, Toni Collette has said that she was so moved by the emotional resonance of the story while filming, she did not even realize it was a horror film until after its release. Anyway, I think the scenes with Malcolm and Anna, had a more emotional impact on me, than any of the scenes with the Sears interacting with each other. Overall: While, the dialogue writing isn't the best and can be highly spoof by later films. Not even, the awful director cameo by M. Night can hurt this movie. Regardless of what you know, think of M. Night Shyamalan's work since this film. His first horror movie is often viewed as one of the best, and I have to agree. It's worth checking out.""""I do believe this is my masterpiece""
The final line spoken by Brad Pitt in the 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds is one I have often hoped was a declaration of director Quentin Tarantino's. I do believe Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's masterpiece, excelling his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, and his 1994 classic Pulp Fiction. The script is airtight with every line of dialogue having a purpose. Starring Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz-- in an American breakout performance for the ages, Inglourious Basterds exceeds the film mastery audiences have grown to expect from Tarantino.
Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) has found a home in German- occupied France harboring Jews in 1941. Landa slaughters the family with the exception of young Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) who is able to escape. Shosanna vows to get revenge against Germany and bides her time plotting after her escape. Three years later, the cinema she owns is selected to host an illustrious movie premiere to honor German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). Zoller immediately takes a liking to Shosanna, convincing Hitler (Martin Wuttke) through his reservations about the venue. Shosanna isn't the only one plotting a massacre at the movie premiere, however. Unbeknownst to her, a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine also have a plan for a massacre at the cinema the night of the premiere. The group who does one thing only ""kill nazi's"" have developed a plan with German movie star Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to sneak explosives and artillery into the cinema which will be filled with German military and the high command. The two plans are developed, independently of each other, ensuring that, one way or another, Hitler will meet his demise on the night of the premiere.
I am, unashamedly so, a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's. He's one of, if not the best, modern dialogue writers, in my estimation. A script carries a film, and if the script is good, the film will usually be good, as well. No one writes dialogue like Tarantino, with the notable exception of Woody Allen. The other unique thing about Tarantino is his lack of formal film schooling or training. Tarantino never went to film school, yet amassed a wealth of film knowledge from reading an extensive amount of film history, and screenplays. Every Tarantino film is riddled with bits of film history throughout the film, making his movies a cinephile's dream. Film scores are also incredibly important to Tarantino and pivotal to his films. He is able to arrange a film score that seems like it doesn't work, only to reveal that it's perfect. I could spend decades writing about how riveting the interrogation scenes are in Inglourious Basterds, solely due to the fine script, or I could spend an equal length of time talking about how many plot points Tarantino brings seamlessly together by the film's end; Inglourious Basterds, however, is simply a film that begs to be seen and experienced first hand. The lighting, the nods to classic cinema, and every Tarantino-esque moment comes together perfectly creating a film that will be difficult for the director to top.""It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.First of all the movie shows that the human being is extremely complicated.There are a lot of persons in one head.They can fight one with another,they can have long talks inside the head.The individual can be proud of some of them or be ashamed.To fall in love,to hate,to give birth to a baby and to kill--and all these things happen inside one and the same body and directed to one and the same human being is tough.The movie is my favorite because it is a mixture of a nightmare,a common life story,scientific fiction and fine psychology digging in the depth of human brain.And I adore the actors.Their job was not simple but they managed to make you believe,and they touched your soul.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There are only a few times a year where a movie completely catches you off guard and there are fewer times where a movie will be imprinted and branded into your mind forever. 'Swiss Army Man' is one of those films. It's funny, disgusting, beautiful, and simply amazing on just about every level. This is where cinema is at its best. Director and writer pair Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known as the Daniels) have masterfully crafted a screenplay and beautifully shot film that that covers just about every aspect of being alive and human. It's almost a coming-of-age story in a weird sort of way and is full of pure, amazing life, even though there is a corpse throughout the entire film. This movie takes those small, precious, awkward moments in life and puts them flat on the table for everyone to see. It's a little bit gross and weird, but it's also amazing and beautiful. I don't think any two people could have played the two parts any better than Paul Dano or Daniel Radcliffe did. They are simply phenomenal in their roles and bring such a heartfelt performance to each of their characters, that you can't help but want to spend more time with them.
We first meet Hank (Dano) who is on a small deserted island, as he is about to hang himself with makeshift rope, when he suddenly sees a dead body on the shore (Radcliffe). After he slips and almost hangs himself to death, he walks over to the corpse only to find out that the corpse has a ton of gas still inside of it. Soon enough, Dano is riding this farting corpse like a jet ski to a bigger place where civilization might be. Hank brings the corpse with him as he tries to find help and home and figures out that this dead body has a lot of cool powers and uses, like chopping down trees, spewing up rain water, farting fire, and shooting things at super speed out of its mouth.
The body soon begins to talk as Hank props this corpses head up and pokes and prods him to get him to do things. The corpse goes by Manny and is just as innocent as a newborn. Manny is discovering life and has no idea what it's like, so Hank answers all questions from jerking off, to riding a bus, to going on a date and listening to music, to watching movies and having parents, and even re-writing the childhood classic ""Everybody Poops"" with actual poop inside the pages of the bible. No matter what you may feel about this movie, there will be something good you will take away with it, whether it be friendship, love, accepting yourself and others, happiness, or just a farting corpse that smiles. It's all here and on display in the most beautiful fashion.
Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are incredible in these characters. Dano plays Hank with such charisma and charm, yet with a chaotic and scary side, that you are never too sure about him. You can love him one minute and be frightened of him the next. Hank has many layers to him and Dano executes each emotional layer flawlessly. Then there is Daniel Radcliffe, who might just deserve a Best Actor nomination at the Oscars this year for his role as a corpse. Even though Manny is supposed to be dead and gross, Radcliffe plays him with so much life, that he is, well  alive. I've never quite seen anything like it before.
The two Daniels have really broken the mold with 'Swiss Army Man' and I'm sure this film will be etched into the minds of cinema lovers for years to come. The soundtrack is also fantastic by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell and has a fantastical and indie element about it. This is one of the most original and fun movies of the year.""I may in fact be biased with liking this movie seeing as how it's a cult film featuring Robin Williams, one of my favorite entertainers. I still believe that it's a good movie and it's weird how audiences like it a lot more than critics. I admit it's not a classic, but it's a fun cute little movie. I like the premise as it features Peter Pan actually growing up and having to fight Captain Hook as an adult. Yeah, it would have been nice to see a young Peter Pan, but this is still a cool idea. Dustin Hoffman is a lot of fun as Captain Hook too.
I will admit this is a bit too long. It's not that complicated of a story. I remember reading about parts of this film as a kid in a little book. It's weird how I never saw it as a kid! Well, nostalgia can work well and it can show you cool stuff you missed out on as a kid. I admit it's pretty silly, but it's still really fun at the end when they use all these goofy weapons that fire paint and eggs at the pirates. It's hokey, but it is one of Robin Williams' finer roles. I'm glad to have seen him like this. ***""I never understood why this movie didn't make more money or get better reviews. This is one of my absolute favorite movies, have watched it at least 10 times. Every girl between the age of 12 and 17 should watch this movie. It teaches a lot of lessons about what can happen when you trust strangers.
The movie was suspenseful and very well done. Peter Jackson's films, in my mind, are always brilliant, and this one is no exception. This one is even more exceptional because it will teach teenagers what can happen if they find themselves alone with an adult they don't know. I think many of the reviews about this movie miss this point.
Tons of suspense in this movie, and if you want to take a trip back in time to the 1970's this movie will resonate with you. And I love the fact that her father won't stop until he finds his daughter's killer.""This is on my all time favourite list. I love that movie. Buddy is an elf and he is looking for his father. He was always a bit different. He was raised by elves an a human. As soon as he finds his father, he wants to gain his love and affection. He does hilarious things to achieve that.
Buddy is clumsy and very charming in its own special way and you can 't avoid to like him.
The story is quite simple but I never get bored to watch that movie. I have been doing this every year since I was a teenager. No Christmas without Buddy the elf.
It is something you can watch with the family or on your own.
The film covers romance in a charming way without overdoing it or getting cheesy. It is very funny without forcing it too much. I am not a big fan of Romance or Comedy but this lovely movie gem has all going for it. You get the Christmas spirit and what's really important packed in a wonderful and entertaining film.
I strongly recommend to watch it. Hopefully you will love it as much as I do.""This is a dark satire, set not so much in the future but in a kind of parallel present, in which being single is outlawed. Without a partner, you're either pray for hunters, or you have a chance to hook up with someone in a kind of institutional hotel. If you fail, you get taken to a transformation room, where you're turned into an animal.
The film maintains a deadpan tone throughout, in vibrant contrast to the horrible deeds perpetrated by and upon the characters. The cast, led by Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux and Olivia Colman, enact scene after outrageous scene with straight faces. Goodness knows how they did it.
It's merciless, often very funny, and as far as English-language movies are concerned there's really nothing like it that I'm aware of. A treat.""Tired of seeing the same old boring drivel over and over again? Want to watch something new and original? Check out The Lobster. You will not be disappointed. This film feels totally fresh. It takes place in a world that looks similar to our own but which we soon discover is vastly different than anything any of us may have experienced. It's more like a strange dream or a nightmare, and every minute of it is full of fun.
The storywhich deals with a divorced man who is staying at a hotel where single people hope to meet a significant other or else be turned into an animal of their choosingis totally unpredictable and leaves us on the edge of our seat in nervous anticipation. Then, halfway through, just when we think we know what's going to happen next, it takes a huge turn and we're off on the next leg of our adventure. Then it takes another turn and then another. It builds in excitement and intensityand insanityright up until the end, and before we know it the two hours have gone by in what feels like half the time. And the ending is amazing. I didn't even see it coming until thirty seconds beforehand and I couldn't help but smile as it unfolded.
The characters and the story are bizarre and unreal, nothing like real life, but that's what is so good about it. Even their speech patterns are strange, which makes the voice-over narration all the more enjoyable and ridiculous. At first it feels like bad acting but then we get used to it and then we start to love it. But it's not by any means dumb comedy. On the contrary, it's very smart and deliberate in what it does. And this film has a spectacular sense of humor that is all its own and which stems from these bizarre and unique characters.
At one point, the character played by John C. Reilly in perhaps his finest role, stares in bewilderment at man who asks him if he's ever danced before. After several awkward seconds, Reilly replies, quite matter-of-factly and with a lisp, ""Yes,"" only to then be asked what kind of dancing he did. Frustrated and still confused, Reilly sighs and responds: ""It depends on the music."" It's hilarious because it's exactly what the character should say but not what we would ever expect him to say. And the film is full of wonderful moments such as this, all dry and all hilarious.
The writing and acting are exceptional and unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's been said that there are only seven or eight stories, each being told over and over again in different ways. But The Lobster seems to defy that statement. I can't think of any other movie or story to compare this to. This is truly a one-of-a-kind film and I feel it will develop a huge lasting legacy.""....a master piece about nuclear war which horrify people in the cold war era in a very funny way that makes you laugh loudly and think deeply at the same time and finally (stop worrying and love the bomb) ...we have a group of brilliant actors like peter sellers,George c Scot and a great director Stanley Kubrick.i watched this movie so many times and every time i enjoy it and that in my opinion is the mark of a great movie.
every thing looks real and hilarious at the same time.its the ultimate black comedy which may teach us how dangerous misunderstanding and fear of the other can do. finally if you did not watch this movie yet go and watch it you will not regret it""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I might have found it.
I can only describe You Name as masterpiece a term that have only used for a small handful of films that I have watched throughout my life.
I've seen Shinkai's previous films which I really enjoyed but this is his greatest work so far. Forget the comparisons to Miyazaki because although Your Name is beautifully animated, has a wonderful score and weaves a engrossing tale it has little in common with Miyazaki's work other than the media - that's not to say it's any lesser piece of work.
If you have seen the trailer you'll probably think that this won't will be much different to other body swap films or anime that you might have seen, however Your Name is much more than that and deftly mixes various genres to make a very satisfying whole and everything about this film is pitch perfect.
The first act sets up the body swap scenario and this section is sweet, funny and charming. It really helps the audience to get to know and care about the characters while it also mostly sidesteps many of the clichés as the body swap is less about gender and more about city vs countryside, modern vs tradition, dreams vs reality and of course distance.
However as the first act comes to a close - just when you think you know where the film is going Miyazaki pulls the rug from under your feet with a twist that you won't see coming (despite some hints). Unlike most films where the 'big twist' seems tacked on or used in an attempt to make something seem clever, the twist in Your Name feels completely organic and deserved.
It's here where the tone changes and that kind of shift is really hard to pull off however Miyazaki handles it brilliantly, as the tone shift never jars against the first act it actually compliments it!. The rest of Your Name has an utterly beautiful sense of melancholy and longing which most films would find hard to equal.
I don't want to reveal any more about the film as you really need to experience for yourself. Needless to say that the films visuals are gorgeous but special mentions for the editing which I thought was amazing and the score and songs by Radwimps which really helped the film find it's heart.
I don't often cry at films especially if it feels they are attempting to force an emotion from me. Beauty or genus tend to make me cry and for the last 15-20 minutes of Your Name tears streamed down my face.
Highly recommended, a must see! You don't have to be an Anime fan to enjoy this!""While there's plenty to say about this third (and apparently final) film in the groundbreaking Toy Story series, if you at all enjoy movies, you've likely seen it or are planning to see it. Toy Story 3 continues the franchise's tradition of telling stories that tap into the sense of wonder and imagination in adults and children alike. Like all of Pixar's movies, the characters, comedy, and storytelling brim with more ingenuity, wit, and heart than nearly anything else on the market. They don't just make great children's films or great family films, they make great films, period. Like last year's Up, Toy Story 3 explores poignant themes of aging and mortality while wowing audiences with thrilling adventure and humor that puts competitors to shame. It is as charming as the first two films, with the advantage of ten years' advancement in computer animation and a screenplay that is truly touching. Highly recommended for the whole family (except the youngest of children; our heroes are put in grave peril, which may frighten or disturb them).""This movie has become as Iconic as the Colt Peacemaker/sixgun to the Old West. While the Old West is full of mystique, nostalgia, and exaggerations, we know this and still love it. This movie exemplifies what our imaginations are capable of. A hypothetical adventure is the best way to describe the plot. Imagine a setting of the west during the civil war. Imagine three characters that embody man's natural inhibitions allowed to roam free without restrain. Even the Good would have to be a little bad just to keep up. Or in this case, the Good better be real ""good"". These men are searching for a treasure, and anyone that gets in their way is in danger. The characters are masterfully cast. Adding to this, their portrayal makes them some of the most memorable ever. Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes are unforgettable. Even Tuco, a man who is disgusting, murderous, and untrustworthy becomes a character you can't help but root for.
On top of all this, the scenery is fantastic. The film was shot entirely in Italy. Although, you would never assume it wasn't New Mexico. At the same time, all actors aside from the main three speak Italian and are simply dubbed over. This adds to the nostalgia of the movie to me and is noticeable with a close eye. The guns used in the movie are all historically/technically inaccurate/wrong. But all this is forgivable as soon as you hear the opening notes of the soundtrack. Ennio Morricone has composed one of the best soundtracks of all time. Few movies have made such an impact on American/world culture than this movie. I hope that at least until my dying days people remember this movie, and it inspires an adventurous spirit. It is truly that good and is easily of my top two films of all time.""The departed it is arguably the best movie of the 2000'sand they're probably hasn't been a better movie since then. Scorsese is back in the world of organized crime. This time instead of the Italian Mob, the focus is on the Irish mob in Boston. Led by Jack Nicholson who humor and one of his best performances in Year's The biggest question is who can you trust . Damon and DiCaprio are both undercover, Leo is a cop pretending to be a criminal and Damon is A cop working for Jack Nicholson . Mark Wahlberg also gives one of his best performances of his career and was awarded with an Academy award nomination. Also in the film is Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Anthony Anderson and more are also in the epic crime saga. Who's working for who and who can be trusted with questions are constantly asking yourself while watching this. A great movie that get to the weather with each additional watch . The most cities for anyone who is a fan of Scorsese or the crime genre in general .""I wouldn't align it with all time masterpieces, but it definitely is great movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton nailed lead character, but from them I didn't expect anything less. Meat Loaf additionally spiced winning combination. But my biggest surprise was that movie was based on Chuck Palahniuk novel. Although I saw it many times that ""detail"" never caught my eye. Chuck is completely nutz, but movie did not indicate his style to me. Now I definitely have to read the book. Movie itself is fast, entertaining and with good twists, although main twist is somewhat predictable if you are watching the movie carefully enough. If there is anyone who didn't see it so far, you should correct that mistake urgently, and for others, it won't harm you to refresh your memory, there's always new details you missed before.
8,5/10""i think this movie is really good representation of hurt in the past female who have turnt to heartless femme fatale and her long way to healing and letting feelings in. under the skin she is an alien and that motorcycle man seems like her past toxic lover following her everywhere she goes (even if she's in the another planet now), making sure she isn't feeling anything for anyone, taking control over her life. when she lets deformed-face man live he simply can't stand the idea of her being good to another 'lover'. we need to take note, that deformed- face man was also kinda an alien in human world. that touches her deep inside and changes her. she escapes with no trace. hunting and feeding scenes very metaphorical - she picks up basic dudes that don't seem to have understanding in life and tracks them down only with her outer beauty. these guys are cheap and are seen as meat in her eyes. motorcycle man also seems to be satisfied by that, it seems like he's confident about her killing other men as long as she stays under his control, but there are scene where he examines her eyes to make sure she's still submissive. finally, when she starts to feel, her world turns around, she seems frightened as hell, don't seem to trust herself or others anymore. she turns vulnerable and that man in the woods hunts her down (he uses same small talk she used in the past before sinking men in black liquid) when she finally reveals who she really is. it turns out she is a black-liquid-like creature, who can't rely on herself and without killing others is really no one and is destinied to die in one way or another. raper only speeds up this process by setting her to fire, and, of course, makes the dramatic effect of rejection. this movie may be a sad story about a woman that was beautiful inside out, but couldn't find the right lover because of her different nature. she was truly an alien to herself and others around her. of course, an amazing movie like this always leaves the room for interpretations.""From today's perspective this story is nothing special, even though it is a bit ahead of its time. Acting, music, directing, everything's good, but not that much to put this movie in ranks with best accomplishments of all times. What makes this movie so special is one of the most deserved Best Cinematography Academy Awards in movie history. Although this movie is from the ancient 1949. cadres, angles, play of light and shadow is still fascinating even today. Especially at the very end of the movie where grand finale in sewers and epilogue at graveyard left me breathless. In the endless sea of Hollywood hyper-production it is good to see such a masterpiece every now and then and remind yourself why are movies considered to be form of art.
10/10""Charles Chaplin, if he never did anything else, will be remembered forever for this film and ""City Lights."" In this one, there seems to be a revolving door to the jail. He is arrested time after time after time. He is a cog in the machine of the factory where he works. He does monotonous work, putting a single bolt on some piece of equipment. Eventually, he breaks down and causes a commotion, getting himself thrown in jail. He meets a free spirit, played by Paulette Goddard, one of the true beauties of the silent film. Through a series of random events, including inadvertently stopping a burglary, he is give jobs, but they are always a disaster because of his high strung nature. He is accused of being a communist. He comports with criminals, always seeming to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Society doesn't seem to like free spirits and he pays the price. The thing is that no matter what, he stays in high spirits and continues to prosper as a man.""Really it is amazing movie which story line is based on the the Story of an Indian soldier struggle,how it become very specific from a common man through his hard work,high confidence & Dedication toward his dreams.The filming of its Story on silver screen inspired youths.there are so many scene of movie which are very inspiration & emotionally,touch the heart of Audience & taught our upcoming generation if we have proper planning & Dedication for their dreams,they become real in our life,really thankful to whole team present such motivation theme on silver screen.the acting are really excellent which present story in very effective manner.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released but only recently re-watched and wow I missed a lot the first time around. This movie is a outstanding movie all around, definitely one of my favorite films from 2013. The movie captures Solomon's's frustrations brilliantly, that he is a freeman sold into slavery but nobody believes him because he is black, it can be compared to Shakespeare's 'comedy of errors' in the way the mistaken identity plays a major part. The story of the movie is excellent and very interesting, what makes it even better is that it's a true story. All of us no matter if we are black, white, Asian etc. we can all feel for Solomon and his hardship and when we put our minds into Solomon's situation we feel for him even more. Chiwetel Ejiofor does an excellent job of conveying to the audience the sheer pain that Solomon faces. Michael Fassbender just like in Queen's previous films: 'Shame' and 'Hunger' plays a really evocative character. Also just like in Queen's previous films the use of lighting plays a huge part in the play. The use of light in the film distinguishes between joyful scenes and joyless scenes. Overall I believe this is a very solid movie and I found it to be a very enjoyable watch.""Well, there is not much left to say after seeing this amazing picture but that i regret not to have seen it earlier. The way this story is brought to the viewer is in my opinion, brilliant. The fact as it is not presented to you in a deeply realistic way, i by this i mean that this movie has a very marked caricature way in its characterization, image, speeches and even narrative. Gives you the constant same feeling you get of you reading a book, as you imagine the scenes, the places, the light everything. And i think that shows what a great job the Wes Anderson did giving you this brilliant film. With nothing else to say i advise everyone to see this movie.""One cannot ask for a better cast of best actors in Mumbai. Naseer, Om Puri, Pankaj Kapoor, Tabu, Irfan,
Vishal Bharadwaj gets credit for brilliant film with high caliber in fields.
Every character is built strongly and it is difficult to decide to like or be against any character.
Minor roles played by Om Puri and Naseer play a very critical role in telling the story strongly. Their agreeing to play minor roles talks greatly about their dedication towards the art of acting.
Pankaj Kapoor's portrayal of Mumbai don with grounding in reality is almost impossible to match.""As said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.
'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.
Was also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.
However, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.
The story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.
Fine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.
Overall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""John Wick"" (Keanu Reeves) is a highly regarded hit man for the Russian mob who has gotten married and retired. Sadly, five years later his wife dies and he is overcome with grief. Anticipating the impact her death will have upon him, his wife makes one last secret arraignment and has a little puppy sent to him a few days after her funeral as a parting gift. Realizing the love behind the gift he immediately becomes attached it. However, one morning while walking down the stairs of his home he is hit on the head by a thug named ""Iosef Tarasov"" (Alfie Allen) and before losing consciousness watches as it is killed in front of him. Afterward, Iosef and two other hoodlums then steal his mint '69 Mustang and leave. That afternoon these same thugs take it to a body shop to sell but the owner recognizes who it belongs to and refuses to have anything to do with them. As it turns out, Iosef is the son of a Russian mob boss by the name of ""Viggo Tarasov"" (Michael Nyqvist) who becomes terribly upset at Iosef for what he has done and desperately attempts to make amends with John. Unfortunately, John refuses to talk and this results in Viggo sending a dozen men to kill him at his home. But John is waiting for them and none of them come back alive. And now it's his turn. At any rate, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really enjoyed this particular movie and it kept me entertained from start to finish. I especially liked the performance of Keanu Reeves who essentially owned the role and provided a dominating presence throughout. In short, I thought this was a really good film and I have rated it accordingly.""This has become one of my favorite Christmas films over the years.
This is a classic that has everything to please children and adults: with a killer mix of adventure, comedy, melodrama and embedded moral. The main thing, to me, is that the Christmas spirit is there, so the rest just clicks into the puzzle easily. The movie is predictable, of course, but that is part of the charm you expect from a Christmas story, unless you are watching an horror movie or a proper adult comedy.
I loved Macauly Culkin when he was a child. He is brilliant in this movie. He fuses with his character in a way that is difficult to separate the two, showing the great actor he was even at that age. The Good Son would would highlight his maturity as actor, so he is not a pretty face here. Macauly and his character Kevin looks angelical but is far from being an angel; he has a good heart, has an insight into what is good and bad, is ready to be advised by wise people; at the same time, Kevin is also creatively ruthless with the baddies because, well, they brought it upon them and deserve it.
Despite Kevin being alone, this is a choral movie. It wouldn't have been the success it was if it wasn't because the performances of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, who are brilliant as the mischievous yet naive baddies. Daniel Stern is especially funny, and has one of the best on-screen yells in movie history. I don't want to forget John Candy's secondary role in this movie, who is deadpan funny in one of those garrulous characters that were one of his trademarks. Roberts Blossom is also great as the lonely grumpy old neighbor. The rest of actors were believable in their respective characters as well.
Home Alone warms my heart and cheers me up every time.""Thrills, story-line and good acting. Now that is getting off to a good start. But it doesn't end there. This movie unfolds like a good tale should and the movie viewer is comfortably invited into this world for a couple of well spent hours. Who doesn't like a heist movie? First, the caper. Can it be done? Is it worth it and what are the risks? Second how do we ""getaway"" with it? The getting away with it is what robbery movies are all about. Do they live happily after to spend the cash and live a lavish life or does fate have different plans? Ask yourself this too. Would you have done it? Could you have done it? McQueen, who plays Doc in the movie is willing to risk it all once again to find out. The stakes are he gets caught, gets away or gets killed. This movie focuses on the getaway aspect of it. Keep in mind that the money amounts back then are major amounts for that time. In other words, you could live happily and comfortably for the rest of your life on the score. It gets better when you add the fact of escaping to a place where money is even worth more than face value. The trick is, can you get there? I have always liked McQueen and his acting and he doesn't let you down for the realism on the subject matter. Definitely recommend sunflower seeds or you will nail bite or smoke. Good movie to snack by and have a tasty drink ready to go. No cell phones or bathroom breaks or you interfere with the tension which builds quite nicely. BTW...the true mark of a good movie is seeing it again and again because it has memorable scenes. This be the case here""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wow... I would have seen a billion movie since the time i have been born and would have read a million reviews on IMDb but never in my life i thought of writing a review here, so of course this is my first and honestly i don't know where to begin from...
This movie personally for me has been the biggest wake up call, i have never been jolted so much by just a movie before. This is a tight slap on the face of ugly corporate world... Which many of us have been and still are suffering by it. Yes this movie is not for people who have never seen the face of corporate world, so it will be unfair for those to comment on how this movie is and in a way it's unfair for the movie too!
Beautifully acted by Ranbir (i am not a big fan of his work but totally blown away in this one) The story is by far the best of my life... Maybe a bit biased as i can connect to it. Totally love the movie and thanks for bringing an awesome movie on such a serious subject... Cheers!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am always a bit dubious about war/combat films as often they are heavily biased so I approached this film with some apprehension. The slow start didn't engage me straight away, but it became very clear that the whole tone of the film was very different from the usual. The film portrays men in combat without the need to include stereotypes; the characters were depicted in such a way that gave them depth and complexity and almost an ordinariness. There is very little political comment regarding the situation in Benghazi throughout the film, although there were some allusions to the men being abandoned by US military; however, this was done very subtly, as opposed to Oliver Stone in-yer-face, which was actually more effective. I'm not familiar with any of the actors other than Toby Stevens, but the quality of the performances all round was exceptional. The horror and loss were felt in equal measure, and the sense of having to persevere in the face of the odds being increasingly stacked up against them, built up over the course of the final showdown. I disagreed with some of the reviews that the film was too long, and feel the preamble was necessary to the whole plot; these men were intended to be bodyguards and ended up in the middle of a war-zone, so the soft start was entirely appropriate. This is a great film which appears to have been largely overlooked, and I hope it gets more recognition now it can be streamed.""Michael Bay did a great job of bringing the Benghazi story into a film, the action and tension feels real and keeps you as a viewer in suspense (my heart was beating fast!). I didn't understand fully the story of Benshazi before this movie so everything that happened was a surprise for me, comparing this movie to other modern war movies its safe to say it is on the top of the list. this is a good movie to watch with friends or by yourself at home, would not recommend this as a chill out with the GF movie. the movie contains violence and lots of blood, its not as kitschy and emotional as American sniper so i liked it much better. Enjoy!"*** This review may contain spoilers *** A lot of people hate on Step Up but to me it's an awesome movie and one of my favorites I love Channing Tatum in this he plays Tyler Gage a character who vandalizes the theater Maryland School of The Arts and gets 200 hours of community service while doing that he meets Nora who needs a partner to temporarily rehearse with when her permanent one twists his ankle and can't rehearse for awhile he offers to help basically from then on while rehearsing they start to fall in love he also thinks about applying to the school. To me this is a beautiful film and story the choreography is amazing as well. I just love it except for one scene that made me cry. I don't want to really spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it but I strongly advise that you do because you're missing out."There are three main characters, Nathan who owns the world's largest search engine company. He is an acknowledged a genius. He is obnoxious the way he uses his wealth and fame to bully others and treat them as toys. He uses his search engine to spy on everyone on earth. He is a jerk, in much the same way Steve Jobs was.
Caleb is his employee, a talented, pleasant, handsome, young nerd.
Ava is Nathan's AI creation.
All the action occurs in Nathan's high-tech, high-security house hidden miles away from anything in the mountains. Nathan uses electronic key cards to lock people into rooms for his amusement.
Supposedly, Caleb's job is to test Ava to see if she could pass a modified Turing test when he would interact with her face to face.
Most of the movie is either awkward flirtatious getting to know you conversations between Caleb and Ava or Nathan being a prick tormenting Caleb. The pace is glacial. The dialogue is quite non-technical and reasonably sophisticated for Hollywood.
One of the themes the movie explores is how do you know when people/robots are lying to you, and when are people/robots just pretending to like you.
As you would expect, Nathan gets his just deserts, but the movie has an unexpectedly gruesome dark and somewhat confusing ending. It is not at all the happy ending I expected. It left me feeling ill.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It seems like a ton of horror movies come out every year, and most times, they don't live up to their potential. There are a handful of horror movies over the last decade that really satisfy us horror fans. Films like 'The Babadook', 'It Follows', and 'The Conjuring' will still be talked about for years to come. One name in the horror genre, or at least in recent years is James Wan. This man burst onto the scene with 'Saw', which was basically genre changing and spawned a ton of sequels. Wan also made a few other horror films, all testing the bounds and pushing us into a new horror direction, while still respecting his influences.
I can easily say that James Wan's name belongs up there with the likes of John Carpenter and Stephen King. The guy knows horror and how to execute it so well that his images will continue to haunt for many years to come. I'm glad he signed on to take on the Ed and Lorraine Warren investigations some years ago and gave us 'The Conjuring' and now 'The Conjuring 2', which was previously titled 'The Enfield Poltergeist'. If you're unfamiliar with Ed and Lorraine Warren, these are two real-life people who were paranormal investigators and professors, who helped a lot of people from hauntings and possessions.
Perhaps their most famous investigation was 'The Amityville Horror', which is where 'The Conjuring 2' starts out, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are investigating the house a few months after the Lutz family moved out. It's here that Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) has a vision of something so sinister, that she makes her husband Ed (Patrick Wilson) promise that they are done with these investigations. That's when things start to go awry over in England at the Hodgson residence where things go bump in the night and then some, as the mother Peggy Hodgson and her four young kids are subjected to moving furniture, screams, and much more.
Ed and Lorraine hear of this and set out to England to help out, despite their previous promise, and then all hell breaks loose  literally. Running at over two hours, there are certain times where 'The Conjuring 2' seems like its doing too much, but there is nothing bad about the movie really. It's just that we're put through so much suspense, horror, and terror, that by the final act, we are glad it's over with. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes you exhausted by the end. Director James Wan is true modern master of horror. He uses the usual horror genre tropes, but makes them relevant and fresh all over again, whether it be a child hiding under the covers while something is hovering over you, or a possessed toy, and even ghostly visions.
Most of these moments will leave a lasting and terrifying impression that will make it difficult to sleep at night, particularly a certain beastly nun. I still get shivers thinking about it. Wan also adds some comedy here, but is used sparingly, and is relegated to the time period. It was a nice breath from all the intense horror that was going on in the film. The score is fantastic and adds to every single moment of terror. It's incredible that these stories are real and that you can actually research them, and Wan does an incredible job of adapting the material and making it entertaining and scary-as-hell. 'The Conjuring 2' is a fantastic sequel and is an instant horror classic.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!""A movie with flashbacks, love, crime, passion, drama, and mystery. That is just the perfect combination. First of all the cinematography is extraordinary, is different, and is risky; and the result is magical. Strating with the positions of the cameras, at some point of the scene they use an angle that is not very common, its original and I loved it. Ricardo Darín is an excellent actor, one of the best in Latin America. his performance in this movie was pretty good. Also Guillermo Francella performance was very very good. The whole screenplay is thrilling from beginning to end, and once it ends, you still wish for more. Is these kind of movies, is these kind of art that makes me proud to be a Latin American. Many people complain the language they use, but I think is wonderful because it adapts itself perfect to the film.""When I watched for the very first time Beetlejuice, I was still a young child whose only reference to the After Life World was the TV show cartoon Casper, that young ghost whose only wish is to become a little boy once again.
So when my parents showed me that movie for the first time and tried to comfort me, assuring that it's not as scary as it looks, I was spooked anyway (the pun is intended).
But I loved it even if I was scared a couple of times. I don't know maybe it's because that movie reminds me a lot of one of my favorite childhood picture ever: The Mask.
Even if the two stories are way different from each other, The Mask and Beetlejuice share a lot of similarities. Their main characters share the same craziness, the same power to do what they want without any limit, the same way to modify their body shape as well. They are both carefree and seem to get out straight from a cartoon. Maybe Michael Keaton has been one of the model Jim Carrey took the inspiration from to play such an eccentric character as The Mask.
The secondary roles are greatly played too starting with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. They have a great chemistry together and they are so sweet impersonating that young couple who suddenly dies in a tragic car crash and are forced to watch what was their home being taken over by a very obnoxious family they want out. They are not particularly being gifted into scaring this family away but that what's making them so attaching.
Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix are also so good playing the new owners. My favorite is Winona by far. She's such a treat playing this young lonely goth girl who befriends Baldwin and Davis as they are the only ones who seems to care about her.
Even Juno and her footballers alongside the dead staff are so hilarious to watch. The only two scenes in which they appears are so fun to watch. There's absolutely nothing to throw away about the cast performance, it's perfect.
Just as this movie!""I stumbled upon this movie in a pen drive, so i decided to watch it without having any idea about the movie, i found the title a bit strange and it gave me interest to proceed watching it.
the plot was great along with its brilliant way to keep you wandering about things, and the coherence between what's happening and how it was explained scientifically in the movie i just love it, the music was so right not to mention how beautiful the cinematography was. this movie can offer a great philosophical experience which lead you to deep thinking, and a romance that you can be content with.
me personally the movie stayed on my mind for days, it's one of those movies you can't forget, i recommend it to everyone fascinated by the universe.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The general idea is a prodigy of simplicity: to turn a whole set of successful science-fiction dramas or romances or adventures into a full-blown comedy and make all these frightening things that make you dream of a world that will never exist like in Star Wars or in Star Trek hilariously funny so that the audience just never stops laughing. Steven Spielberg adds to that a direct allusion to Back to the future but within the science fiction space adventure genre and it becomes phony more than funny, with me grown up meeting me four years old.
The first two films are really funny because they remain within one layer of time. The third one becomes something different, nostalgic, sentimental even, and that breaks the fun to turn it into fear: the fear the negated past or the traumatized past may turn the future which is our present into a nightmare, a PTSS case of time travel trauma, something like PTTTSS, Post Time Travel Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Welcome to the asylum for deeply disturbed minds and brains.
The most attractive and fascinating aspect is the phenomenal palette and variety of extra-terrestrials you are navigating among. Obviously all of them are just the figment of the imaginations of a band of deranged probably young people generally called artists though there might be a few older ones who are more perverse than deranged, or perversely corrugated. You cannot find them serious. They are all of them just impossible mixtures of all kinds of living gadgets, except in the last one where one of them is well hidden in a human body and is deadly frightening, not funny at all.
The next element that is striking is the role of the Black man in black, just recruited in the first film, trained and excellently performing and competent in the second film and growing melancholy and sentimental in the last film when he sees himself when he was four, when his father was killed under his adult eyes and when with a magic flash the little boy will only remember his father was a hero. And of course it is his partner who erases the truth from the little boy's memory, the partner he meets again in the present some seconds later at the end of the film. That episode brings the saga to an end because the fun has been drunk right down to the tea leaves at the bottom of the cup.
We all, absolutely all of us, have rebuilt the image of the father we had, in pink or in black, in celestial blue or in fiery red, but what we remember of our father is nothing but a mental reconstruction, a Lego reconstruction. All the pieces are true, real and absolutely precise, but the pieces have been reassembled in any creative or traumatic way and that's the image we have of the man we call our father. That's normal. That's natural. That's the truth if there is one under the sun. Our memory is selective. In fact, we remember everything without fault but our conscious memory is the Lego construction I have just spoken of.
You may have in some drawer, or in your pocket, something that is attached to your father in a way or another and that reached you when you were three or four. This thing is attached to you and you are attached to it in an unbreakable union and yet you don't really know why you're attached to it and it is attached to you. It might be a sentence that comes back regularly and that makes you sick with fear or happy with instant bliss, and yet you do not know where it comes from, except that it comes from a long, long time ago and you still have it in your mind because it was a positive or negative trauma, and, mind you, there are positive happy traumas that have the same power as negative ones, except that this power makes you excel and not run away and hide under your bed.
If you want to have some fun in an environment of extraterrestrial monsters, with some dangerous situations and beings and many happy just in time right in time epiphanies and salvations, you have to let yourself slide into these hairy and over-twisted stories and forget about your bills and the fact that the heating does not work. You'll survive since these crazy characters did survive.
Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In the year 2032, Batô, a cyborg detective for the anti-terrorist unit Public Security Section 9, investigates the case of a female robot-- one created solely for sexual pleasure--who slaughtered her owner. Imagine Blade Runner, Robocop, Terminator and I Robot having a baby all 4 of them combined that would probably be called 'Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence' now my problem with this film isn't the lack of action although there's 3 pretty good scenes with Bato destroying a bunch of female robots, Yakuza and a big male robot that looks like it came out of the 1995 Judge Dredd film. My main problem with this film it was the fact that it tried to be way too much serious and not have any fun with itself but also way too many Quote: s and philosophy that gets a bit old after a while. Now do i think that this is a great film? Yes it is it does have a pretty good looking animation, the soundtrack is very enjoyable and the overall characters are interesting but the whole Quote: s thing and the lack of any kind of action and villains might make some people get a bit bored with it. (7.9/10)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It's hard to find words to describe how much I love Re-Animator. It is just twisted and gory and deeply dark and hilarious. A masterpiece, really. Even with its main song sounding like a dead ringer for the Psycho theme (the composer, Richard Band, admitted to being heavily influenced by Bernard Herrmann's famous score).
The story itself is not that complicated  it's loosely inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's ""Herbert West  Re-Animator"". It opens up with Herbert West (played with such perfect, calculated intensity by Jeffrey Combs) at the University of Zurich, re- animating his dead professor, Dr. Hans Gruber (yes, he shares a name with the villain in Die Hard, which was released a few years later). Accused of killing him (again), he exclaims ""I gave him life!"".
He's now back in America at the fictional Miskatonic University, located in Massachusetts. He immediately starts clashing with Dr. Carl Hill (played by David Gale) on the topic of brain death. But when he starts renting a room from fellow medical student Dan (played by Bruce Abbott), he can get back to work on his reanimating reagent, including trying to show its effectiveness by practicing on Dan's fiancé Megan's (played by Barbara Crampton) cat.
Dan: ""Why does it make that noise?"" Herbert: ""Birth is always painful.""
Dan tries to pitch this theory to Dean Halsey, who also happens to be Megan's father, but him and West are quickly barred from school for their apparent madness. They can't resist further experimentation, so naturally they break into the school's morgue to try it out some more. The hilarious and oftentimes graphic chaos that ensues from here on out is just unbelievable. Dean Halsey (played by Robert Sampson), lurching around in a straitjacket after his accidental killing and reanimation is unforgettable. Dr. Hill, who is just sketchy right from the get-go, naturally takes full advantage of the situation and attempts to blackmail West and take credit for his idea. West quickly kills him and then realizes his once-in-a-lifetime chance to reanimate such a freshly dead corpse.
West chopping off Dr. Hill's head with a metal shovel and then immediately being annoyed when it won't sit up in the metal dish is just morbid humor gold. When Hill's head wakes up after being injected and hisses ""We t, you ba tard"" as his body lumbers behind him brilliant. Then we get to see Hill walking around carrying his own head with him, feeding himself pouches of blood, sneaking into the morgue in his ridiculous disguise oh man, so good.
There is, of course, the one scene that almost everyone knows whether they've seen the movie or not  the severed head rape scene. It's shocking, to say the least, but honestly not as bad as I expected, if for no other reason than it is fairly quick. But the implications of the whole thing  Hill's disturbing obsession with Megan, him employing Megan's own father to procure her for his own sick fantasies (Dean Halsey is both re-animated and lobotomized at this point, but still)  are disgusting.
But the ending  which I, amazingly, won't spoil for you  is one of my favorites of all time. Seriously, watch this movie NOW.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I'm going to start off saying that I'm really mad at the people who are saying this movie gives them headaches, and that it's boring. IT's NOT!!!!. This movie is beautiful, it has a great story of a character named Ayan played by Ranbir Kapoor. Ranbir played this character amazingly, Anushka and Aishwarya played their character really good too. This is a story about a young man who meets a girl at a party, they start kissing and chit chatting all night, and they form some kind of connection between each other which forms them to becoming good friends. Ayan starts hanging out with Alizeh, and one night at a party where they play the breakup song Ayan finds his girlfriend cheating on him with Alizeh's family friend. Which makes Ayan cry, and that scene was really funny. From that Ayan and Alizeh go on a heart break holiday to Paris. Over there they do a lot of fun stuff, and Ayan gets a feeling inside of him self about Alizeh, and he really starts to like her a lot. Alizeh dosen't have the same feelings for Ayan, but she still loves him a lot as a friend because she thinks being friends is more chilling, fun and loving than being boyfriend and girlfriend because after you break up then you don't have the same feelings about each other as you did before. During another party Alizeh meets her old lover named Ali, and she gets in a shock where she just wants to get out, and go somewhere else. Ayan starts comforting her, and he knows that if Alizeh sees Ali she will fall in love. Ali catches Alizeh and explains how much he loves her, Ayan keeps telling Alizeh to go, but finally Alizeh gets weak and goes off with Ali, leaving Ayan heart broken. He then kept calling her, but she never answered. She finally did a long time after, and tells Ayan that shes getting married to Ali in India. That call leaves Ayan emotional and mad because Alizeh spent SO much time with Ayan and accidental made Ayan have close feelings for her, and she suddenly just left and is getting married to someone else. The reaction on Ayan's face during that scene is priceless. It will make you feel the same way he is. Ayan goes to their wedding and is quiet and shocked over there. Then suddenly sings a beautiful song ""Channa Mereya"" That scene will get you emotional. He ends up telling Alizeh about his feelings for her, and after she tells him she doesn't feel the same way, he flips her off and leaves. Later on he meets Saba(Aishwarya) and he tells her the story of what happened. She ends up giving him a book with her number in it. Three months later he calls her and meets up with her. From that point they become boyfriend and girlfriend. But during the movie I had a feeling that the only reason he is going out with Saba is because she reminds him off Alizeh. Saba loves Ayan a lot, but ends up telling him to leave her sight because if she spends one more moment with Ayan she will fall in love again. Ayan runs to Alizeh and tells her again the way he feels for her, but she keeps explaining him that she loves him a lot but only as a friend because she wants to keep her relationship with Ayan forever. Ayan Doesn't get it and takes off. Ayan then starts paying more attention to his career which is singing, and gets his name noticed. He then meets Alizehs husband Ali. Ali tells Ayan that Alizeh left him 2 years ago. Ayan then runs to a place where Alizeh always goes to when ever she wants to run away from the world. Ayan then waits for her for 2 days, and then she finally comes. This scene is very emotional. Alizeh takes off her hat, and is now bald because she has cancer. This leaves Ayan heart broken again because he knows he only has a couple of time to spend with her, so they again have fun, but he still loves her, and wants to be with her. He wasted so much time loving her from the beginning, and now when he finally got her back she left forever. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING, IT HAS A GREAT STORY OF HEART BREAKS, AND IS A DIFFERENT kind of love story. This movie is worth watching. This is the kind of movie that will have to think about it more and have you watch a second time.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Moulin Rouge, unlike most jukebox musicals, actually has real effort put into it. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices sound great and have great chemistry and the atmosphere and surrounding feel epic. The side characters, including John Leguizamo, Richard Roxburgh, and Jim Broadbent, also put a lot of personality into their performances. The renditions of the songs are well- orchestrated and are wonderful to listen to, the sets and costumes visually dazzling, and it gives you a feel of inspiration. While the tone does change, it feels appropriate and in place, giving the feeling of Christian and feeling the emotion and passion of his experience. Moulin Rouge has the feeling I love to feel, and that's being transported to a surrealism that's just amazing to behold.
However, I do have a small problem with the film, and that's the editing. The shots go by so fast that it gets really distracting, and almost a little hard to concentrate. I wish that the shots lasted longer and took their time to let you see the setting. It's also far from revolutionary, and if anything, doesn't necessarily have the most original plot, characters, or themes. But at least it's A story.
Moulin Rouge is definitely worth checking out. Be prepared to experience a true musical.""All three Toy Story movies are wonderful. The second continues to feature the adventures of Woody and his sojourn in the greater world. Once he is kept home because of an arm ""injury,"" he finds himself taken away (quite through an accident) and set to be placed in a toy museum. He gets wanderlust as he imagines himself immortal. But what is not there is his friend Andy who left him behind. Soon his friends come to ""rescue"" him because they see what is happening to him. They also come to realize that there is villainy afoot from a man who has a financial interest in him. What happens is that Woody must be rescued from himself as much as the bad guy. I thought the first movie was amazing, but the second is a worthy sequel.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Beuaty and The Beast is a classic Disney movie. The movie is sad and happy! The movie has classic songs. Such as Be Our Guest and Belle. Belle story is basically about a prince who is cursed to stay as a beast then finds this lovely girl that soon loves him. Beauty and the Beast was kind of confusing at the same time. When gaston shots the bird and the little guy catches it in the bag that disappears in the middle of the song. The movie though has a classic story and really good transition scenes. The movie sometimes was weird but still great. The characters were funny but sometimes very confusing at some parts. Like when Chip asked Ms.Pots ""What's happening"" and she said ""You will learn when your older"". It's so weird that chip does not know love.""you should be shocked when you find out that this is only the second movie for a 30-year-old guy. then you become assured that he is the future of Hollywood and also the future of musical movies which has been always dead.
Damien Chazelle made the best musical movie ever with only $3,300,000 budget. I think he deserved an Oscar nomination but it's his first masterpiece so it's not a shock for me.
J.K. Simmons the actor who rises in his 60th and does the role of his life and totally deserved the Oscar. When you first hear that Miles Teller is the main character you think that it's a miscasting but he totally nailed it and proved that he is a really good actor.
And I have to talk about the film editing and sound mixing which were epic and blended us with the movie and the music.
My rating is 10/10.""This film is one of the best i ever saw !! I will never get bored watching it and once a year or more i watch the whole trilogy same day.. After i saw the lord of the rings trilogy i knew i couldn't stop there so i searched for the director (""Peter Jackson"" no i didn't knew he was the director of this film i was too young back there) so i watched every film he directed (well not all of them but the most of them) a good director giving people what they want and how to make a movie interesting...
About the movie has a bit of everything inside it.. Action: there is so much action u won't get disappoint. Drama: there is also drama inside, if you haven't seen the movie yet just get prepared because this movie gonna touch your heart. Adventure: if you open an dictionary you will see next to the word adventure the ""lord of the rings""... One incredible music gets stuck into your brain for the rest of you life its something impossible to forget.. i could say much more about this movie but i don't want to spoil it so if you haven't seen this movie yet i suggest it with no regrets!!
My respect to the actors!!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Why cash in on the merging of various cinematic universes, where the ultimate good, Mr. Nakatomi Plaza himself decides to get an upgrade from doing mostly B movies to getting featured in, what you could call Shyamalan's welcome return to form with an effective thriller of the mental disorder variety?
Why not?
Why use a mental disorder as a scare tactic?
Why not? Plus the director's downright bad recent ventures and then suddenly coming up with ""The Visit, 2015"" and now ""Split"", make it seem he just recovered; or, it could could be withdrawal, a ten million dollar worth of fracking withdrawal. I pray it isn't. I also pray they don't add another five to that ten - Shyamalan, it seems, is better off with restrained financing, which push him to concentrate on the plot more than the air bending CGI or a hundred men shaking trees tops, to make it look windy. Or was the wind also CGI? I couldn't tell except for when Mr. Ex-Underwear-Model wanted everyone to run with him to perceived (again by Shyamalan) safety.
Yup, the audience and the critics and pilgrims like yours truly are, for lack of a better word, split. Dr. Fletcher's dramaturgy thesis on MPD, now called DID - because the guys at SHIELD (or in this case The Mutant Enforcers of Xavier) now think its disassociating to have more than one consciousness within a single human being - is there, perhaps only to fill in on the disorder and also for innovative structural attempts. There couldn't be a better 'shot by the fracking ""Red Dragon"" book' picture this year.
I'll tell you what really takes you off tangent and to the fracking moon; the hellish moves that Hedwig forks over to the strange as frack dubstep track, Snails by Frogbass; it could be the other way round but that doesn't change the fact that McAvoy gives a terrific, masterful show, changing in to all twenty three (one to go) personalities by the end (in the beginning there's six, tops, that Shyamalan focuses on), in quick facial transitions. It frighteningly reminded me of Ledger's Joker. And that's saying a lot.
Anya Taylor-Joy is another force to reckon with the shotgun show n' tell and running like Ripley, from a xenomorph.
It did get a little over the top but hey, after all if the keen viewer and Shyamalan are convinced of a 'superhuman' trail, then by all means.
Why not?""It is a light-heart old Indian comic , suitable only for the audience from Indian Sub-continent. My dear Non-Hindi speaking friends , its a good movie only if you understand Hindi . Does not make any sense for you to watch the movie dubbed in any other language ( as the comedy and timing goes well with the native language) because it is in TOP 250 list and then write a review that would be titled as ""Spoiled My day "" . No offense to anyone , everyone has their freedom to express their views like I did :)
I have seen many non-Indian friends complaining about this , thus writing this review .""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I've never read any of Stephen King's novels, but have seen a few movies based on them. They are generally satisfying, except Salem's Lot.
As a huge fan of alien movies, I've seen ALIEN, PREDATOR, Dark Skies, Alien Abduction, The Fourth Kind, Extraterrestrial (2014), Body Snatcher, Independence Day... Movies about alien creatures are generally fascinating.
Having seen so much about the genre, I'm not easy to please. But wow! The creature effects in this movie are so impressive. Those aliens look real and stunning! Once you've seen them, you'll never look at eels in the same way again. Beware when you fart or take a dump, or when your stomach makes weird sounds... alien bug could be inside your belly, and it could show you a more grotesque way to die than being chestbursted. The creature design is definitely disgusting and effective.
It would have been better to give more backstory to the character of their alien friend who could see the future.
The movie is slow here and there, and the story remains to be expanded. It feels like the pilot episode of a TV series. Nevertheless, the climactic battle is definitely worth a look.
PS: The movie sends a good message to kids: Rescue the bullied. They might be aliens who can teach you tricks to see the future.""I'm a big fan of Frozen, so I was very excited to watch this film as well. It blew away my expectations. While it does not have the most complex story in a Disney film, there is just so much to love about it.
Starting off with the characters. Rapunzel is a beautiful and adorable lead full of quirkiness and humour. Flynn is an equally charming male lead. As far as the villain goes, Gothel is perhaps the strongest villain since Hades in Hercules. She is evil in a completely different way.
The animation is beautiful. There is one scene later on that is just jaw- dropping. Especially on the big screen. The environments are lush and colourful, and the characters are detailed and good-looking. The songs are memorable as well.
All in all it is perhaps my favourite Disney film just because of the charm and beauty of the whole film.""Glory is an amazing movie which chronicles the emergence of the first all-black volunteer infantry of the Civil War. Leading actors: Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington, each portray their diverse characters in such a way, that the events shown become easier to understand. Often times, the remarkable acts of the colored infantries in the civil war, are left less noted. However, the film showcases this monumental step in the creation of equality for all US citizens. The bravery and determination of the men, along with the tenacity of their leader, Col. Robert Gould Shaw(Matthew Broderick),is made prominent. Despite the fact that the film was created in 1989, the overall quality is ahead of its time. Scenes are emotional, powerful, and action-packed. All in all, Glory is a must see if you are looking to expand your knowledge on events of the Civil War, or if you are just looking for an impactful story.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** As this sequel begins the dashing Prince Charming races to rescue Princess Fiona from the Dragon's Tower and learns she is no longer there; she is on her honeymoon. Meanwhile Fiona and Shrek are just getting home to the swamp. They haven't been back long when they receive an invitation to visit Fiona's parents; the King and Queen of the country of Far, Far away. Shrek thinks it is a bad idea that is bound to end in disaster but Fiona insists and they end up going, along with Donkey. Once they arrive it would appear that Shrek was right; Fiona's father isn't happy with her choice of husband and is soon plotting to get rid of him. He isn't the only person wanting Shrek out of the way; Fairy Godmother is keen to get him out of the picture so Fiona can marry her son; Prince Charming.
Sequels that are as good as the original aren't all that common but this is a good example of one that is just as good. Most of the original characters are back again; although this time Fiona spends most of the time as an ogre, which I preferred. There are also plenty of great new characters; most notably Puss in Boots, a feline Zorro voiced by Antonio Banderas; Fairy Godmother, the villain of the film voiced by Jennifer Saunders and Fiona's Parents, voiced by John Cleese and Julie Andrews. There is plenty of action throughout as well as a good number of laughs. There are also lots of references to other films that should be a treat for older viewers without spoiling the enjoyment for youngsters. We also get a good number of well-known songs; the most entertaining being when Fairy Godmother sings 'Holding Out for a Hero' at the ball. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** 2014:
After my nerves being left ripped by Oculas on the big screen,I decided to check what other titles auteur film maker Mike Flanagan was making. Learning that he was making another Horror movie with Thomas Jane,I started to look forward to seeing the result. Checking back over the next year or so,the only thing I would find is that the title was stuck in limbo,due to the original studio going bust.
2016:
Giving up on seeing a new Flanagan creation,I was shocked to see Hush suddenly appear on Netflix. Searching round for info on Hush,I was thrilled to learn that the Thomas Jane one had recently hit DVD,which led to me finally waking up.
The plot:
Continuing to mourn the death of their young son Shawn,Mark and Jessie decide to give a child a new opportunity in life,by applying for adoption. Accepted,the couple are introduced to Cody,whose been an orphan since his mum died. Taking Cody home,the couple find out he is obsessed with butterflies. Putting Cody to bed,Mark and Jessie get set to go to bed feeling somewhat optimistic for the first time in ages.Filling the living room,the couple suddenly find themselves surrounded by beautiful butterflies. Trying to hold the wings of a butterfly,Mark and Jessie find themselves surrounded by a new sight in front of them,of their dead son Shawn.
View on the film:
Filmed after looking in the mirror of Oculas,editor/co-writer(along with Jeff Howard) directing auteur Mike Flanagan expands on the reflections displayed in his last work,with the use of extended sequences played in eerie silence pointing to the silent terror of Hush. Despite the studio ""issues"" leading to the main CGI effect looking a bit wonky, Flanagan delicately scatters the CGI to give the icy chills a poetic fantasy quality, startlingly lit via bright butterflies,whose colourful wings keep Flanagan's nightmare bubbling underneath .
Cutting back to Shawn's death with razor-sharp edits, Flanagan expands on the blurring of reality and a horrific dream world of Oculas with dazzling tracking shots being tipped sideways by Mark's and Jessie's dream coming true.Showing a real liking for literal jaw-dropped screams,Flanagan reunites with cinematographer Michael Fimognari and co-composers (along with Danny Elfman) The Newton Brothers to fly the family into creepy horrors,sprayed with a light green and yellow over the house to give the backdrop an unsettling ""off"" atmosphere, highlighted in highly stylish shots focusing on what is slithering up the walls of the ""dream"" family home.
Examining the parental loss in Oculas,the screenplay by Flanagan & Howard hits extraordinary raw power by expanding on the theme to look at the loss of a child. Avoiding the ""creepy kid"" clichés,Flanagan returns to the troubled suburban home to brilliantly look at the family unit for the first time, (which Ouija 2 would continue on) with the writers uncovering the grieving fantasies of Cody,Mark and Jessie,which hides the horror rotting the corners of their suburban home walls.
Joined by Mike's son Rigby Flanagan-Bell playing a young version of him, Jacob Tremblay gives a great performance as Cody that keeps the character away from the bratty notes of other child characters,by Tremblay showing a real care towards keeping Cody mysterious,and keeping Cody's personal tragedies intact. Struggling keep things together after Shawn's death, Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth give superb performances as Matt and Jessie,thanks to Bosworth gradually bringing the grip Jessie has held since the death to the surface to protect her family,whilst Jane casts the grief across Matt's face,as he hopes to see his son once more before I wake.""This is one of my favorite film noir classic films. I have it racked in Top 100 and Top 25 Film Noir movies of all time. I am writing this review at this time because I recently watched it again (January 23rd). I was prompted to do this because the film was being previewed at 2017 Noir City film festival in San Francisco.
I owe a copy of the film and have watched annually for the last five years. The story was adapted from a novel by W.R. Burnett. The screenplay credits go to John Huston and Ben Maddow. Huston also directed the film. The music was created by Miklos Rozsa while the director of photography was Harold Rosson.
It has an outstanding cast including Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagan, James Whitmore, Barry Kelley and John McIntire.
Supporting cast include: Sam Jaffe, Marc Lawrence, Brad Dexter, Anthony Caruso and Marilyn Monroe.
Sam Jaffe is the brains behind the ""heist"" concept and sells the plan to Louis Calhern. Jaffe's character is smart, brilliant and controlled. His one flaw(not shared) gets him caught in the end.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!""I totally agree with several before me that at some point in the film, one forgets he is watching Val Kilmer play the late Jim Morrison. This is a marvelous performance by a gifted actor. His physical appearance and voice really capture the essence of one of the top five or six rock bands ever. There is lots of documentary footage of the doors because they came along when videotaping and filming were everywhere, so to capture a realistic display of performances in a film had too be good. We get to watch the guys slowly evolve. We get to see how Morrison held sway over the group. Ray Manzarek had an incredible talent of his own, and yet he kept being dwarfed by the charismatic lead singer. There were times when Morrison's performances were almost transcendent. The music is really good here as well.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I give this movie 9 only due to animation quality, it's good as movie too good as story, everything in this movie are appreciable. Hats off to the director Makoto Shinkai, for getting such a good thought, and as of I have heard, he got this idea from a anime Ranma 1/2. Well, I'm also an anime fan, and watched other anime movie. Other movies such as Spirited Away, are better than Kimi No Na Wa, but ""Garden of words"" one of my favorite Makoto movies has also been included in some scenes of the movie, so overall I can say Makoto has worked hard on this movie and he deserves every award he gets. Also the band Radwimps, have worked good for the song Zen Zen Zense, appreciable for each word. I hope Your Name releases in India soon, crosses 1 billion USD collections and wins an Academy Award. Hail Kimi No Na Wa, I can't wait."*** This review may contain spoilers *** This and Pretty Woman were released about the same time and this was far superior to that in every possible way. The emotional wallop combined with humour and and inevitability made this an instant classic. Ghost was in my Top Ten Movies of All Time list for a long long time till The Fellowship of the Ring came along and kicked it out. Each time I watch this classic I feel so emotional that its staggering- every emotion possible can be experienced when watching this. A timeless classic that needs to be watched and rewatched and passed down to other generations. Casting is perfect- storyline perfect- only only the sobby ending keeps this from Masterpiece status in my book."*** This review may contain spoilers *** ı know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that Schindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been. It does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe that Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.
The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.
Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black- white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.
There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The bond a woman feels with her lover -- has a film ever captured it so realistically?
Anna (Alida Valli) will have no part of any schemes to capture expatriate Harry Lime (Orson Welles), though he has faked his death and left her to fend for herself in the corrupt and broken-down rubble of post-war Vienna. Nor, once she knows Lime is dead for good, will she have any of Holly Martin (Joseph Cotton), the hard-bitten American pulp writer who possesses the integrity that Lime has long ago exchanged for expediency.
Lime had offered a job to Holly, and that's what has drawn him to the dark and dilapidated streets of the Austrian capital. In the end, we see, Martin has performed his duties to perfection.
It's hard to believe the book ""Positive Psychology at the Movies 2"" does not list ""The Third Man"" in its index. In many ways, this film shows man at his best under grueling conditions. Martin shows judgment, self-regulation, perseverance, perspective, and bravery.
The casting and ensemble work here are perfect, and Robert Krasker's cinematography must set the standard in the field. I'm a little mixed on the famous score featuring endless gyrations of the zither. Perhaps it provides a bit of metaphor: Like the rot at the core of the culture, one can never quite escape its rather crazy-making influence.""This is one of my favorite movies ever and definitely my favorite Christmas movie ever. Although I'm not American, this was part of my upbringing, and it was shown on TV every Christmas, it still does.
This is, foremost, a great movie, with a great direction, a great story, great performances, great tempo and atmosphere, a glorious BW and a classic old glamour Hollywood melodrama. It is of course, very sentimental, but also very philosophical.
I love James Steward. He was the quintessential good charming actor able to convey goodness with his mere presence; he becomes his character here in a heartfelt performance. Yet, this is a choral movie in which everybody shines and everybody seems to be doing the same. I have always had a weakness for Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, but everybody is great and believable in their respective roles.
This is a movie about despair, that reminds us that, even in our darkest moments, there is always something or somebody that will help us if we allow ourselves to be helped.
This is a movie about being mindful about what we wish for, and about what comes from our mouth, about being grateful about what we have and not taking it for granted.
This is a movie about the power of family and community, and about the power of being a good human being and how goodness, our goodness, impacts other people in ways that aren't always evident to us.
This is a movie about the value of leading your life in an ethical way, because when you do, people notice, and respect comes by the hand.
Finally, this is a movie about the spirit of Christmas. These days the festivities have become part of frenzy of empty consumerism, lack of empathy for the poor, and another holiday. However, when I watch this movie it brings me memories of my childhood when Christmas was a magic period despite my family not having many means. Probably because of what Christmas has become today, I find it more relevant for the new generations. It has all the magic and values that I would like my children, if I had any, to grow up with.
The movie is very sentimental, of course. It never fails to move me. But it is not cheap sentimentalism. It digs into what the meaning of life is, and comes up with an answer that surprises because it is obvious and we have it in front of us every single day.
Unforgettable.""A film that stands apart, not only for its painstaking creation & execution, but for all that it has managed to influence while still remaining undiscovered by many.
A gem among the countless films that present you with an open & close story: Stalker is more about the journey that begins inside your own mind once you begin to think about it, and the dreams that follow.
Every new person that watches this film has the potential for a new perspective to awaken from as if within a dream.
If you like cut & dry movies with the plot spelled out for you, you might not enjoy this film. If you like films that don't spell out things clearly & leave interpretation up to the viewer, then this film is for you.""NbNW is about mans constant and interminable desire to perform coitus. The movie is about two people who go through a series of wild and unfortunate events, however through it all, they still manage to be wildly attracted to one another and never falter in their drive to bed one another.
As is said in the movie, women like attractive men with good taste. Cary Grants character is good looking, and enjoys the finer things in life. However his success with the female lead goes beyond that, he is also indefatigable and motivated. He has a drive, a passion and an aggressiveness that alone drives the first half of this movie.
Every technical aspect of the film is superb. You are watching art on screen.
I don't think modern audiences would like this movie. On its surface, its basically Borne Identity without a superspy as the main character. Except there's minimal action and the main character is a smarmy berk.
The only real problem I had with the movie was that it felt like a series of elaborate set pieces where the plot was written later (which I think is what actually happened).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Thankfully - we have the utter disaster of a movie that was ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" as a baseline for this movie - although I personally found it more in line with ""The Whole Nine Yards"".
Now it's probably no secret that too many people who do reviews take themselves WAY too seriously and seem to think that everyone who reads their review will consider them to have been the center of their universe for a few minutes (newsflash - watch the yelp episode of southpark - that's you - exactly you) - but I kind of expected people to cut this movie the slack it much desperately needs. Reviewers seem to be utterly incensed that this is not some uber slick Jason Bourne effort; but those same reviewers ranked both ""Skyfall"" (the truly first ever raping of the James Bond Franchise) and ""Inception"" (one of the worst movies ever made) rather highly - and really only showing there is no accounting for taste.
This is a lighthearted, funny af movie with an EXCEPTIONALLY solid cast, direction and production. It's let down by some glaringly poor continuity and editing - but that's the only reason I am not giving it a solid 10. Now let me explain something - I cannot STAND Zack Gandalfushallnotpassius or whatever his name is - I still want a full refund for the 1h 30m of my life spent watching him attempt to act in ""the Hangover"" - but he totally owns this movie. Gal Gadot and Jon Hamm are literally two of the best casting decisions made in a movie in a long time. It does not have to be Oscar worthy to be good casting. They are not only polished - but they are believable. They could do with being a bit more ""bad-ass"" but it's hard to say more about that without giving away spoilers.
Isla Fisher was new to me - but I loved her. She's cute and sassy, but carries her character very very well indeed. Second only to Zack - her performance was superb.
This is not a sleek, intellectual thriller - if that's what you want - watch the Odessa Files, or Bourne - or Bond (but obviously before Barbara Broccoli turned it into an utterly crap franchise) - it's not an action packed explosions/car chase filled movie - it's dry humor delivered with impeccable style. Reviewers need to learn how to look at a movie for what it is and review it that way - rather than review it for what they thought it would be like.
Pros: it's slick and moves at a great pace. It has a predictable plot that leaves you with no illusions of grandeur - there is nothing to figure out - this movie does it all for you. Beautifully I might add. Great acting - tons of laughs if you don't expect Katt Williams levels of comedic genius. Gal Gadot in lingerie. Isla Figher In lingerie.
Cons: it's slightly bereft of any really cool action scenes. Having the spies be utterly impeccable would have been a really good idea - but they are kinda just smartish - run of the mill types. Some of the plot line makes very little sense - but this is not a proposition for Wittgenstein - so really who cares if this spy-comedy is a little plot thin? Continuity/editing is awful in one very particular spot.
Totally unnecessary - but utterly welcome extra Pro: This movie has Gal Gadot in it. In lingerie.
Let me restate that: *clears throat* Gal fricking Gadot - in fricking lingerie!! That's an automatic 4 or 5 stars.
It also has Isla Fisher in Lingerie - but seriously people Gal Gadot In lingerie!
I highly recommend this movie. It's a ""lay on the couch with your significant other eating popcorn and drinking red wine"" type of movie. And that's just fine by me :)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Outstanding biopic that typifies what the American dream actually looks like--but that's the scary part. Michael Keaton's portrayal of Ray Kroc, the (self-proclaimed) ""founder"" of McDonald's, is positively brilliant! Comparing his look and performance to the real Ray Kroc seen before the credits roll, there is no doubt that director John Lee Hancock (known for The Rookie and The Blind Side) made the right choice. ""The Founder"" takes us on a journey from Southern California to Illinois and beyond as we follow the course of events that radically revolutionized an entire industry and gave birth to one of the most recognized brands in the world as well as the very concept of modern franchising. What Henry Ford did for American motorcars, Kroc did for American ""speeedee"" service food. Ray Kroc realized the American dream by stopping at nothing until he built his empire, even if it meant stealing from a business and breaking up a marriage--all within the confines of the law. We've all heard about ""the American dream;"" well, The Founder depicts what it takes for that dream to come true. If you're willing to be a cut-throat bully with few if any inhibitions, then you can build an empire claim to be the founder of another's company or even run a country.
Although the film is presently foundering in box offices, it is definitely worth a watch because of depicting the story of one man's American dream that would essentially steal the laurels from baseball and apple pie to become a larger than life symbol of America recognized throughout the world. It's unfortunate that this film is not garnering more attention because the writing, directing, and acting are absolutely brilliant. Full of irony and ambiguity, The Founder could have easily been called or at least subtitled ""Birth of a Salesman."" While watching the movie, I could not help but compare the plot of this film with the iconic play ""Death of a Salesman"" by Arthur Miller. Both tell stories of salesman but the end result is vastly different. Both Willy Loman and Ray Kroc were dedicated to their respective craft of salesmanship; however, Kroc took the practice of sales and pitches to the next level--in fact he created his own game in which only he could win. Where else have we seen a bully play by his own rules and build an empire into a brand in and of itself? I'll allow you to draw that conclusion. Further irony can be seen in Ray Kroc's surname. His sheer cunning, predatory ways of conducting business can easily be likened to the crocodile itself. Despite receiving credit for inventing the fast food assembly line, much like Ford did for American car manufacturers, the ""speedee"" service was invented by Dick and Mac McDonald of San Bernardino. Thankfully, the brothers are receiving the credit that they deserve--albeit posthumously.
The cognitive dissonance that many will experience during diegesis of this film is fascinating in and of itself. Early on, you will find yourself rooting for Ray Kroc because he comes off as an underdog. He is able to provide decently for him and his wife, but it is evident that his business is in the process of collapsing. Even after striking the proverbial deal with the McDonald brothers, you may still root for him because the brothers make it difficult for Kroc to actually engage in successful franchising. The tide begins to subtly shift when the chain begins to take off. When the brothers deny Kroc a request to renegotiate the terms of the contract in order to boost capital and revenue, Kroc hires a new business partner who provides the knowhow to shift the focus from running a burger chain to being a real estate mogul. Interestingly, when confronted by the brothers on a break in the contract, Kroc points out that they could take him to court and probably win, but by the time he would drag them through hearing after hearing, and trial after trial, the brothers would be completely bankrupt. Much like the milkshake substitute that boosted revenue and mitigated refrigeration costs, but contained no milk, a handshake deal with Kroc is just as fake.
Ray and Joan Kroc are well known philanthropists--in their later years. In fact, Joan Kroc left most of her vast fortune to many charities. The most well-known recipient of the inheritance is NPR. Even today, if you listen to the programming, you will hear the Estate of Joan Kroc mentioned as a supporter of the public radio organization. Whether you appreciate NPR or not, one cannot help but think that all the philanthropy of the Kroc (namely Joan) is a result of easing the conscience since the Kroc fortune can be likened to blood money. It's entirely plausible that much like Marion Crane figuratively cleanses her spirit in the infamous ""Psycho"" shower after having stolen the money from her employer, Joan may have very well given her fortune away in an effort to ease her conscience and do good with the figuratively ill-gotten money. If there is anything inspirational to take away from this film, it is the power of that persistence and looking for potential in the most unlikely of places.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I wasn't sure what to expect with this one when I sat down in my seat at the screening. I heard a couple things about it but I still wasn't hyped for the movie. To be honest, I thought it would just be another disappointing science fiction indie movie to add to the list, but I was wrong.
The cast was great, amazing performances from Anne Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, and Tim Blake Nelson. It might seem like an action packed sci fi film based on the premise, but it was more a story of this woman (Anne Hathaway) and her going back to her hometown realizing she is in some way related to the actions of a giant monster ravaging its way through Seoul, South Korea.
The movie did have some refreshingly funny bits that took me by surprise as I thought this was more along the lines of the Godzilla remake from 2014 in tone. Speaking of Godzilla, this movie is definitely paying homage to him and other classic movie monsters.
I don't want to give too many details away but I will touch on something that bothered me in this movie. Violence against women that seemed way out of place and took me out of the movie for a little bit. Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) hits Gloria (Anne Hathaway) multiple times in one particular scene towards the end, it was added to show that he was evil but it seemed like overkill to me. Something that redeemed the movie was that she did get revenge on him in a way rewarding to the audience.
My Suggestion: See it! There is nothing quite like it and trust me, you'll have a great time watching it just as I did.
Seen at TIFF 2016.""""Captain Fantastic"" is truly a unique movie experience which you must take in deep.
Sure, this film is not that much perfect. Sure, the screenplay takes some questionable turns at some singular moments. But it is damn energetic and absolutely unapologetic!
In other words - I loved it! It seems that last year was a really god year for films after all. I am surprised by the variety of movies which surprised me, evoking the whole spectrum of emotions from the inner and outer cosmos. And ""Captain Fantastic"" is the newest addition to this list of special experiences which make our lives richer. The film from Matt Ross is a beautiful nod both to a long gone social movement and to our newly found 21st Century new age way of life. I am really, really impressed by the cast. Wonderful performances from Viggo Mortensen and the whole ensemble of his ""children"" (watch out in the future again for: George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks and Charlie Shotwell). This ""family"" invigorates the viewer with fresh voices speaking of freedom, change and at the same time of social and family values which we all tend to forget on a daily basis. Mortensen's character is both arrogant and loving to everybody around him which makes him really a nicely developed controversial person. It is refreshing for every viewer see such qualities together. I myself felt questioning many of the choices which I make as a parent. Which is a wise nod from the director to us all. Close community living and modern life technologies clash in front of the hippie background. The emotional connection is beautifully shot, using the metaphor of travel as the ultimate vessel for overpowering oneself. Any back to nature spirit will find something for itself in this movie. I think that this film is a carefully polished heartfelt jewel giving us a glimpse of what an emotional crisis looks like from a more subtle and graceful point of view.
What touches us in this comedic drama is the thought-provoking youth performance which resonates with our every day struggle to find all the right answers to the question: What it really means to be a parent...""My son in-law and I took my 6 yr old grandson (his son) and we had a fun time. He loved the movie, we loved the movie. There were a few times when most of the audience cheered and laughed, something you don't often hear these days. The monster is ugly but lovable, the plot is typical and impossible. The special effects are good and have you believing in this weird creature. There are no real terrifying part to this movie and it is not all about the hero gets his girl or too grown up for the little ones. There is just plain fun for all who go if you let the kid in you watch more than the adult. If your grandchild is going, go with them and just enjoy them as much as the movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** So this film was hyped to death coming up to its initial release. One of the most anticipated superhero films, arguably on par with The Avengers.
Now, the cynical viewer would easily point out the parallels this film has with Batman vs Superman (i.e. the government taking action against vigilantism, two superheroes and their rag-tag groups taking opposing sides of the same agenda, a sinister mastermind orchestrating the situation in which these characters oppose one another, and so forth.) However, while the DC cinematic universe have given us minimal source material of these versions of their classic superheroes, Marvel are about ten steps ahead, having fleshed out every character in the ensemble from previous films (well...bar two but we'll get to that) The plot seems a lot to take in. While the whole Sokovia Accords legislation drama is mainly taking centre stage, Cap must try to save Bucky from himself, as the ghosts of his past come back to consume him, figuratively speaking. Cap and Bucky try to stop the 'villain', Zemo from awakening a group of other enhanced assassins and try to evade the law enforcement in place after their successions at saving the world are misconstrued due to the collateral damage.
The superhero subplot turns out to be a complete red herring as Zemo successfully lures our main characters into a Russian bunker and revealing that Bucky killed Stark's parents, which leads to the true battle between Cap and Stark.
Overall, the movie is serviceable, even if the cast list does seem excessive. The inclusion of Spiderman and Black Panther doesn't feel too much like it was shoehorned in, but many would make the argument. The airport fight scene between the Avengers factions takes a while to get to but the drama is constant, meanwhile.
Ultimately, you know that there aren't going to be any lasting stakes because Marvel still have a dozen more of these films to dish out. The cycle is getting a little repetitive, but if you're looking for good action, cool visuals and superheroes generally doing their thing, you're in luck.""Given the fact that this movie is about a tragedy, both on the human side but also on the environmental, maybe the word ""amazing"" is not the best to entitle my review. But in any case, this movie is really worth watching.
It's about the courage needed to face adversities and come out of them in one piece. But it's also about standing up for what you believe to be true, no matter what others might say.
This movie was about the worst oil spill in the history of the US and at many points it's really shocking. I particularly felt my stomach in a knot when this seagull entered the bridge of the ship near the rig.
Mark Walberg was amazing but Kurt Russel was also breathtaking. I was also impressed by all the mechanics and technology involved in the process which are usually a black box for people that are not involved in this business.
Overall, a really informative movie with some really interesting acting from all the actors involved and of course a really inconvenient truth that has to become a lesson for all of us.""Everything was spot on in this movie, the acting by heath ledger, the music, the camera shots, the stunts and most importantly, the writing.
I did have a few problems with the movie such as things that didn't explain themselves properly, like when the Joker told batman where Harvey and Rachel was, but he ended up in a completely different place that wasn't explained very well (There is theories on that however)
The start of the movie where the Joker planned the bank robbery and had everyone kill each other, in order to later have the money and burn it all. That also wasn't explain why he did it and the reason behind it, like the amount of times the Joker gave a different story to whenever he talked about his scars.
I have seen this movie so many times since it came out, it really comes down to nitpicking, I highly suggest anyone to watch this movie because it truly is for the acting alone a masterpiece.""When we think of the Deepwater Horizon incident I suspect that most people tend to think of the massive leak, that leaked literally hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of several weeks before the leak was sealed. It was one of the most massive environmental disasters in American history. What doesn't stand out in my memory, though, is what happened on the oil rig itself. This movie tries to fill in that gap, and does so admirably.
Much of it is told from the perspective of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), the chief electrician on the Deepwater Horizon. It opens by giving us a glimpse of his family life (enough to make this a very human and poignant story, but it's not overdone.) Once on the Horizon, we're introduced to various crew members, as well as a couple of executives from BP, who own the rig and the well. There's a lot of technical content, much of which went over my head, but I wonder if that might have been very deliberate. I may not have understood exactly what was happening, but I understood clearly enough that there was a problem building.
The early tension comes from conflict between the crew (especially ""Mr. Jimmy"" - the captain, played by Kurt Russell) who know something isn't right, and the BP execs (the most important played by John Malkovich) who push the crew to keep going because their primary concern is that the project is over budget and behind schedule. When money takes priority over safety the result usually won't be good. In this case it's not. The well explodes, the rig is caught up in a massive fire, and the crew is left in a desperate struggle to survive.
Everything is very well portrayed and the cast does a very good job of drawing the viewer into the story and making you care. I've never been on an oil rig, but the set seemed authentic and gave the viewer the sense of being there. The buildup of tension is well done and once disaster strikes this becomes fast-paced and exciting. Peter Berg did a good job directing. Well done all around.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I had to review this film for the SAG awards, and I have to admit I hadn't heard anything about this film. And the title didn't catch my attention (I thought it was another damn Marvel film). But I'm really glad I got to view it. Except for the first five minutes of the film, the rest of the film was terrific. True. The scene where Viggo Mortenson's character and his kids steal their mother from her grave was a bit out there, but it fit with the whole message of the movie. Viggo Mortenson gave an authentic performance as a hippie/survivalist who tries to raise and protect his children from ""the man."" George Mackkay as Bo is a young actor who clearly has a promising future as a movie star. He was mesmerizing as the uber-intellectual older son who knows nothing about ""life"" outside of the wilderness. Great ensemble and strong performances from the very young actors who play the children. The film gives a poignant portrayal of grief while providing an ironic view of modern society.""I love the movie for being original, fun, amazing, funny, spiritual, really loved the songs, the ideas, and the actors. Definitely a movie worth watching at home with your family. Teenagers won't probably like this much, but young ones and their parents will absolutely love it. Considering the fact they're not a Disney fanatic. I actually had to buy the soundtrack album because the songs were so good. Love Justin Timberlake's voice and ability to put his soul into his singing. Now a days movies for adults, like action, comedies, horror, just plain suck. The only kind of excitement I get, or movies that I like, is from kids movies. That is just sad. So sad.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Matt Ross has provided some discomfort to those of us who mistake in all too much of our bourgeois journey something more authentic than what it actually is. I'll bet Ross has read his Kierkegaard and more. Viggo Mortensen captivates the whole way, even through a few weakly plotted scenes at the end. Didn't matter. We were imbued with the dynamics of the family and its fearless and ultimately humble leader--circle completed, mission completed. Mortensen will bring his family in from the cold to ""integrate"" the culture outside and in their own way perhaps mitigate its corruption as they themselves must learn how to integrate mass, popular society. We believe, yes? The spectator must be content that such family endeavors occur if we are to save ourselves. Someone has to know the complete Bill of Rights and believe in them. We all have to know how to properly bury our parents. It is easy to see how some may not ""get"" this fine little movie whose generally honest script and disciplined direction* saved a ""renegade"" cinematic family from tired hippie jokes. The two parents were extremist and ideological, granted, yet would we not have some like these among us, particularly if they are, as is Mortensen's character, capable of ultimate self-reflection and compromise?""A Monster Calls is a great movie with a well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a deep, meaningful film that blends fantasy and real life together beautifully in a way that neither of them feel forced, they are both there to serve each other. Conor's relationship with each character is very well established, we understand how they feel towards him and how he feels towards them significantly. The character development is phenomenal.
The only major criticism I would have is that it tries a little too hard to leave us in tears on a regular basis, it could have been a bit more subtle in its exposition here. It was too clear that is was trying to be a tearjerker rather than simply delivering emotional material that could leave us in sadness.
The cast is all around terrific, Lewis MacDougall shines in the lead role, the young man clearly has a bright future ahead of him. Felicity Jones is strong as the ill mother and Liam Neeson's voice work as the Monster is well suited for the character. The highlight of the film, for me, had to be Sigourney Weaver, in one of the best performances I have seen her in. She has an unquestionable screen presence in this role, and her English accent is very convincing.
The film leaves you with a smile on your face as the journey Conor faces is both hard hitting and relatable. Heartfelt and well written, A Monster Calls is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama or fantasy.
A monster helps a young boy cope with the illness of his mother.
Best Performance: Sigourney Weaver""History is full of accidental heroes who stood at a time and place where something profound happened around them. This theme shines in Loving (2016), a film about a couple whose marriage was challenged in the USA Supreme Court in 1967. In one of the exquisite ironies of history, the couple's surname was Loving and it was only love that kept them together while a slavery-era law tried to pull them apart.
In 1958, white construction worker Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton) and his black girlfriend Mildred Jeter (Ruth Negga) drove from Virginia to Washington so they could legally marry beyond the reach of their own State's anti-mixed marriage laws. On return they were arrested like common criminals and given the option of a year in prison or 25 years of exile from Virginia. That was no choice for a couple expecting their first child. While in exile, Mildred is inspired by the black rights marches and writes to Attorney General Robert Kennedy who asks the American Civil Liberties Union to take up their case. Eleven years later, it reached the Supreme Court and history was made.
What makes this film outstanding is the way it blends a history lesson with the dramatization of the human effects of racist legislation. Neither the history nor the drama overwhelms the film. The period styling exudes authenticity and the acting performances are finely calibrated portraits of two humble people who became caught up in an era of profound social upheaval. While Richard is over- awed by the growing national attention to their case, Mildred understands her role in history and what she can do for all black people. Joel Edgerton is brilliant in playing surly mistrust of the legal system and is a steadfast protector of his wife. The beating heart of the film, however, is Ruth Negga's performance. She consummately portrays the emotional highs and the lows, from the hope-filled blushing bride to the shattered prisoner of moral injustice, with an acting repertoire carried entirely by her huge expressive eyes.
This is a powerful film. It is not about heroes or villains, but ordinary people who played a small part in shaping a major turning point in history. To call it entertaining is not the right word. Rather it is an engaging, enlightening and worthwhile story about how a Loving couple changed history.""'Arrival' was truly a wild ride. Honestly, I feel this will be a film to be remembered within the genre for years to come. While some fans of the genre may feel that Sci-Fi films should be filled with alien blasting action or deep adventure, 'Arrival' thrives off of the desire to understand and an all-around curiosity for not only what an alien species could do if they were to interact with human civilization but what human nature could do given if this situation were to happen. As an audience member, I found myself curious as to what was going to happen next within the story from start to finish. Although moving at what could be seen as a slow pace, it had this creative ""edge-of-your-seat"" feel to it as I anticipated anything to happen at any moment. If you are to view this film, I will warn you, curiosity and confusion can/will occur, but it only compliments the creativity within this film... Production wise, director Denis Villeneuve executes with suave perfection. With every passing moment, you can feel his influence in what he wanted each actor and actress to express with every movement and reaction. From as little as a simple gesture to the biggest line execution. A special nod goes to Bradford Young for the cinematography within this piece. There were scenes and moments within this films that looked utterly beautiful that blended so well with the vibe of the film. Leaving myself, personally, with stills and movie moments I will never forget as they were so interesting and creative to watch unfold.
With the Sci-Fi Drama 'Arrival', expect curiosity to take over. It is a story to remember and debate/discuss with your friends for hours on end. A strong recommendation here from Oberrated and yet another worthy Oscar nomination.
-- Oberrated.com --""I haven't stopped thinking about Moonlight since I saw it, it's had a big impact on me. This is an intense, emotional and realistic feeling story, masterfully directed by Barry Jenkins, he perfectly captures the look and feel of the rough Miami neighborhood in which the lead character, Chiron, is growing up in. One thing that instantly caught my eye was how visually stunning the film is, the cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, I still can't get over it.
The performances are excellent across the board, particularly the three actors who play Chiron during the different stages of his life, they each give their own unique portrayal of the character and it all works so well. There's also some equally impressive performances from the supporting cast such as Mahershala Ali who plays a drug dealer and also serves as sort of a mentor to the young Chiron, and then there's Naomie Harris who gives a brilliant performance playing Chiron's drug addicted mother.
Also I need to mention the movie's original score which is unbelievably good. Nicholas Britell is the composer and he has created such a unique sounding score, it's so unusual, I've never heard anything like it before so make sure you listen out for it. There are also songs from the likes of Aretha Franklin and Barbara Lewis which are very well chosen for the scenes they are used in and they help to elevate those scenes.
There's not a single flaw to be found in this film, it's perfect in every way, from the gripping story, excellent performances and masterful direction to the beautiful cinematography, memorable score and good editing, it all blends together perfectly, making it the best film of the year and one of the greatest films of all time.
Trust me when I say you would be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this masterpiece, so do yourself a favor and make sure you see Moonlight if you haven't already.""When I first watched this film as a child, I thought it was a boring, slow romp with little resolution. It was short, with hardly any action, and the action it did have had basically zero choreography and style to it.
This was a superhero movie made in 2000, the same year the first X- Men movie came out, two years before the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man film, and a massive eight years before the Dark Knight. When Unbreakable was first released, superheroes were still seen as a childish affair, as the world was recovering from Batman and Robin and other badly made, low budget childish comic movies. Unbreakable was a massive shift from the norm, a piece that could be set in the real world.
Rewatching it now, this film is an incredible piece that would have been far better received and successful if it were released closer to the present. An emotional film about a man slowly discovering he isn't as normal as he lets on, and an obsessed comic-book nerd who leads him to that truth.
The pacing is still incredibly slow for a superhero flick, which may be jarring for some people who come into it expecting such a film. However, if they come in with zero expectation, or expecting a traditional thriller-type movie, they might be pleasantly surprised.
If you haven't seen this film yet, I highly recommend it. It was made before director M. Night Shyamalan's fall from critical grace, so you can expect a tight, well written and relatively subtle film with great performances.""Danny Boyle and the cast do not disappoint in this sequel. It's usually justified to be wary of sequels, especially to classic and well liked films, but this just works - mainly because of the well written script, the nostalgic throwbacks to the original, and the fantastic acting by the original cast and the new actors. If you're a fan of the original, as I imagine most people going to see this are, there's a pretty good chance you're going to leave satisfied. It does the original justice, and where all of the characters are now in their lives is believable. The most important thing is that it balances the whole ""where are they/what's happening now?"" aspect and the nostalgia very well, so that it isn't just a soppy reminiscing fest, while on the other hand not disregarding the past, instead managing to link it to present events. There's a few imperfections here and there, but nothing big enough to stop me from giving it a 9/10. Well worth the wait and the watch.""Jon Favreau's 2016 remake of the 1967 animated classic of the same name is not only full of heart and excellent adventure but it also boasts arguably the most impressive CGI ever put on screen. Entire landscapes and rainforests are created digitally along with the sparse animal life inhabiting these settings. The film is bursting with life as we witness the seamless interactions between the CGI and our single human actor. It is immensely impressive and baffling to think that this entire world was created from thousands of hours of meticulous and detailed work, but the awe doesn't just stop there as Jungle Book manages to be incredibly entertaining fun as well as an unquestionable technical feat.
Jungle Book features excellent voice acting from a cast of talented actors and actresses such as Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson and a singing Christopher Walken as the towering King Louie. The film only features one human actor, played by the young Neel Sethi. At only 10 years of age, Sethi had to interact with animals that weren't even there, which can prove to be difficult as some of his acting was questionable. It's hard to fault Sethi for this, as interaction with CGI is difficult without proper direction, and sometimes the scenes of Sethi's shared screen- time with the CGI creations aren't directed too well. Moments like this are infrequent, but it is noticeable when Sethi is clearly not looking wherever his character should be.
Jungle Book tells a story that somewhat follows that of the original, but features different developments while also excluding some. The story has been criticized for it's lack of substance but I never found that to be an issue. Characters had simple motivations and the story is well told, making it easy for anyone to follow while only rarely feeling dumbed-down for children.
Jungle Book ranks among my favorite films of the year simply because of it's simplicity and just how enjoyable it is. There are scenes of thrilling adventure, heartwarming character interactions and a constant ability to charm and entertain the viewer. There are times where the child actor's performance is questionable and the story eventually begins to run thin, but Jungle Book still managed to be an exceptionally engaging and fun Disney film. It captures the magic of the original and gives the new generation their version, this time with phenomenal use of CGI and excellent voice acting. Whether or not you enjoyed this film, it should be credited that Jungle Book created an entire world in a studio, which should be more than enough to at least earn your respect.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Besides of his ridiculous middle name I am a huge fan of Mr. Night Shyamalan's (Manoj's) movies. Especially Unbreakable was awesome. I had to see this collaboration between Shyamalan and McAvoy in the cinemas.
I heard so many negative sounds about this movie. They were not really about the movie, but about Mr. Night. I don't understand. In their eyes Manoj can't do anything right anymore. So their judgment is already made based on the director. That does not make any sense. Manoj said in an interview that some people don't like his signature by being a small part of his own movies as an actor. That is what I do like about him. Why would the suit fit Stan Lee and not Manoj? Manoj makes me proud to be an Indian and writer of a thriller novel as well.
Split is a very thrilling movie. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I did not want to miss a second of the movie. The end scene was amazing. The acting of McAvoy is phenomenal. The script is not predictable. This is a worthy movie in the resume of Manoj. I wish him all the luck to surpass the greatness of this movie. The woman I went to see this movie with said; ""This is more than a movie, this is art."" I totally agree.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This might be a spoiler, not sure...This movie cost 4 million Euros; 6- 7 million us dollars. The US spends about two hundred million buck one mostly junk movies. First let me say; Glenn Close was a surprise, and she should be considered if this becomes a series, and it should? Seldom does it happen, this movie grabbed me right from the beginning, and would let me go; it's still on my mind...this is why I am writing this. The Walking Dead got boring after the first three years or so...I still watch it waiting for everybody to die off, still waiting. Now back to this movie, The Girl... However you have to think, and I am sure you'll have to watch it again as I will. Sennia Nanua, is a newcomer and (I think) will do great work in the future. Her caricature, Malanie was delightful and captured my heart. And I would have given the movie a 10, thou I believe only classics like Casablanca or Lost Horizons are entitled to the top row of movies. I could go on and on, however if you're not threatened by Zombie movies you will enjoy this special movie. Everyone was great that played in the movie deserves recognition for their part. See this movie somewhere, as I am sure it will go to video or Netflix's or some lame outlet...Enjoy.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** 'Captain Fantastic' is not a super-hero movie, despite the title, but again, then maybe it is as we follow the journey of a big family, both emotionally and physically, as they stick together through some tough obstacles. Directed by Matt Ross, who is most known these days as Gavin Belson on HBO's 'Silicon Valley', 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare films that has just about everything you'd want in an emotional drama- comedy, which is all led by the amazing talent of Viggo Mortensen. The film is a refreshing mix of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' and 'Little Miss Sunshine' and plays to both of those films strengths, while still managing to be original, entertaining, and heart-warming. 'Captain Fantastic' sure has quickly become one of my favorite films of the year.
Matt Ross sure has created a Utopian reality with this film when it comes to raising a family in an unconventional way. If all kids were raised more or less in the way depicted here in this film, things would be better, or at least that's what Ross wants you to think. In a perfect world maybe, but unfortunately this film is quite the fantasy, which is really the only minor gripe I have with the film. 'Captain Fantastic' follows a big family led by Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Leslie (Trin Miller), along with their six kids in rural Washington State. They home-school all of their kids in the forest, teaching them everything from deer hunting with a knife, canning vegetables and fruits, to all of the social and economic issues from the past and present.
The kids know several languages fluently and can even play instruments. However, their mother has been in the city to get ""help"" for her bi-polar disorder, which ends unfortunately. This has Ben and his six kids on a road trip in a decked out hippie bus across country to attend their mother's funeral, despite Ben's father-in-law (Frank Langella) threatening to call the police if Ben and the kids show up, as he blames Ben for his daughter's death. On the road trip the family sticks together when others think they're weird for their intelligent yet awkward ways, including celebrating Noam Chomsky's birthday as their version of Christmas, stealing food from the grocery store, having the youngest kid (7 years old) recite the bill of rights and explain what it all means, and being up front and honest with people and each other when it comes to sensitive subjects that includes topics such a rape and death.
It sounds rough, but Ross captures this family and a very innocent and charming light. Even though the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) can tell you about any literary classic in detail or talk astrophysics, he has no idea how to socialize with anyone his age on a normal level, even though he has applied to all the ivy league schools and has been accepted each of them. Things get a bit serious when an accident happens that makes Ben think twice on how he is raising his kids and must make a compromise with their way of life and living in the real world for everyone's safety.
This journey is not only a physical one, but an emotional one as well, as each kid and Ben struggles with who they are and how they were raised. It's a very satisfying story to tell and to see on screen, as you grow more attached to each character with each passing minute, despite their quirks. One obstacle after another, this family really stays loyal and proves their worth to one another and society, even if it's so far- fetched that it is almost borderline fantasy. The music in the film by Alex Somers is captivating and Matt Ross captures the rugged countryside beautifully.
Viggo Mortensen along with the six kids turn in phenomenal performances, but Viggo truly shines as a realistic portrayal of a father who is trying his best, given his choices and circumstances. If only we all had a part of Ben in all of us in life. 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare beautiful films that is pretty much flawless.
MUST SEE!""In the category of films about ""monster helping a kid"", I found A Monster Calls superior to The BFG and both versions of Pete's Dragon, but far from reaching the monumental height of The Iron Giant. And in the category ""monster as metaphor of real horrors"", I found A Monster Calls better than El Laberinto del Fauno and Tideland, but inferior to The Babadook. All that is translated into a very competent film with an intense emotional content, attractive images and a powerful message. Besides, this is one of those movies which treat kids as real people, instead of frail creatures who shouldn't be exposed to the cruel truths of real life. Director J.A. Bayona earned fame and acclaim with the film El Orfanato, and his sensibility for the horror genre can also be noticed in A Monster Calls, but, this time, transferred to a childish setting... not in the shape of the monster, but the frustration and impotence suffered by kids, who are full of emotions, even though they aren't always able to express them, or change their personal circumstances. And that's what I liked the most about A Monster Calls: fantasy as the catalyst of sad life lessons, which become more eloquent thanks to Bayona's ability to balance magic and reality without diluting the dramatic intensity of the screenplay. On the negative side, the first act of A Monster Calls recycles so many clichés that it was a bit difficult for me to completely ""plunge"" into the main character's story: a misunderstood kid, product of a divided family, and suffering from bullying at school... When is he going to discover that he has special powers, or that he's half vampire, or the heir of an extraterrestrial empire? No, fortunately, A Monster Calls isn't a victim of those formulas, but it ends up taking more interesting narrative roads, supported by Bayona's competent direction and the solid performances from Lewis MacDougall, Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver. My cynical side found a bit of manipulation in A Monster Calls, but I still liked it pretty much, and I definitely consider it worthy of a recommendation.""A Monster Calls is a fantasy drama film based on the novel by Patrick Ness, which itself was an idea conceived by Siobhan Dowd, who died before she could write it. A little bullied British boy with a love for monsters/monster movies has a mom (Felicity Jones) dying from cancer, a dad who has his own family in America, and a grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) who's just too stern. So the little boy, who used to rely on his mom to get him through all of his worries and woes, suddenly feels alone in the world. Until a tree monster (Liam Neeson) comes along, telling the boy 3 stories, claiming that at the end, the boy must tell his own story, his own truth. And so the boy listens to each story, and each one causes him to examine his own life, and learn an important, but sad truth. This movie was beautiful. The CGI was fantastical. The story felt like it was coming from a childlike point of view, and each shot was reflective of the development of the characters. The story-telling elements blended computer animation with amazing watercolor artwork to give them a more fictional look to the traditional live action sequences. The director really knows how to play emotion through lighting. Just, beautiful cinematography as a whole completed this film. As for the acting, it was superb. This was due in large part to Lewis MacDougall, who has only had one acting credit before this in Pan. The boy plays complex emotions and thoughts through his journey, and many times had me tearing up as I felt his pain, anger, and sadness. He kept me engrossed in the film, and I was shocked. Young actors can often drag down an otherwise amazing film. MacDougall enhanced this one. Of course, the talents of Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver can't go unnoticed. The actresses spend much of the film displaying their own struggles. Their own emotions seem hard to interpret at times. This is once again due to the direction, which allows us to see these characters through a young boy's mind. Adults will understand what's going on, but find it's hidden in a haze of innocence. And finally, we have Liam Neeson. His deep Irish voice and tough presence are exactly the things needed for the tree monster. Neeson narrates each story with a wisdom and clarity of knowing something MacDougall's character is learning, because he himself had experienced each one. He does an incredible job, and must be appreciated. Of course, I must discuss the negatives. In this movie, there isn't much to complain about, but I do have some nitpicks. The monster played by Liam Neeson is a great character, but his look kept making me think that at any moment he was going to start saying ""I am Groot."" The designs were too similar. Also, I felt like the storytelling, beautiful as it was, was missing something. I don't know what it was, but I can't help but feel Guillermo Del Toro would have figured it out. And the score felt a little cheesy. It was emotional clichés. Nothing popped out as memorable. Just notes to make you feel things. It definitely could have been better. In the end, A Monster Calls is the movie no one saw in theaters, but everyone should. It's beautiful, and emotional, and amazing. Please, when you can, watch this film. You won't regret it. 85/100""I've seen plenty movies about war and it's not common to come across one that actually portrays war and not someone's idea of it, Mel Gibson direction is emotional yet raw and realistic.
For those of you who are reluctant to see this because you expect to find an over glorification of the United States or the cause of World War II, I recommend you watch this. Yes, there is the usual amount of nationalism we can always find in USA's movies but Gibson shows many faults and holes in it when someone different comes along and I loved to see that.
Andrew Garfield is incredible in this role, I've always thought he was a good actor but now I believe he's great and the Oscar's nomination proves it.
Overall, the acting and direction are the best aspects of the movie and regarding the story, what really adds to it is that it's based on real events. Truly amazing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am not going to lie, i went into the movie theater with such high hopes and the movie absolutely delivered! Honestly, what a beginning to this franchise.
Let's talk a bit about the characters. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Newt Scamander is on point. I was sceptic at first, when i heard that he was cast to portray him, but his work on the screen proved me wrong. His gestures and body language are what really made his character so believable for me. Dan Folger as ""the fun pal"" Kowalski and Erza Miller as ""the main villain"" Credence did great job as well. But the biggest surprise and the best performance for me was Collin Farrell's. His portrayal of Percival Graves was so good, that when he was revealed as Grindelwald's Johnny Depp in the end, i almost felt bad, because that automatically meant, that Collin will not be returning for the sequels of this movie.
One thing that i was certain about after finishing the movie, was that some viewers who are not a hardcore Harry Potter fans, would be complaining about the story's pacing. What i'd like to say to those people is that it was necessary. The exact word is necessary, because we had to believe Newt Scamander's love for magical beasts and their large amount and scale of existence in Harry Potter's world. What i can promise to those people, who really felt the plot like a let down or anything of that nature is that they have to be patient, because what's about to come will blow your mind. If David Yates stays true to the books, we are about to witness some of the greatest events before Harry Potter's birth and the greatest duel in wizarding history.
Give this franchise a chance. If it didn't win you with the beginning, it will 100% with the next movie.""I grew up knowing Jack Nicholson as ""The Joker"" and now a new era of Joker is brought to light. Heath Ledger (May he rest in peace) has brought about a new mental picture of the Joker, and i'm sure audiences everywhere will agree that this ""Clown Prince of Crime"" will forever hold a special place on collector's movie shelves everywhere. While nobody can replace Heath, or Jack; I hold both actors on equal regard for this part. Not playing favorites here Mr. Bale, but for the Joker being the iconic alter ego to the Dark Knight, Heath did just that. While i'm sure critics will find plenty of things to complain about, as an avid watcher of batman movies, this is an instant classic.""Watching this movie unfold, specifically the plot, has been a great learning experience for a burgeoning cinephile. I haven't learned as much since watching 'Witness For the Prosecution'. Yes, I do understand that this movie came before the that.
A child murderer is at large. The police cannot find him, the criminals cannot live their lives, and the civilians cannot relax. It has been 8 months since the first murder and there is naught to go on but a few clues. Among those clues, a red pencil and a wooden table. All citizens of Berlin despair as life continues in an unlivable fashion.
The criminals can no longer work in the capacity that regular life affords them. The police intensely pursue all walks of life since they can afford no alternative. And the civilians of Berlin just want balance to be restored.
The criminals recognize what needs to be done, as the police remain frustrated. Working towards the same purpose as the police they begin to piece together a suspect. Setting out to catch the murderer in their own way using talents unique to them.
The police find a clue while the criminals find a hint. As both close in on the same suspect we must ask ourselves, who will catch him first?""No spoilers...
Oh my. I was a big fan of UK dramatisation, ""The Fingersmith"" so was a little worried about ""Ahgassi"" translating across the sea. I was primarily concerned with the issue of conservatism over there, especially in Korea where censorship can be quite harsh at times. I honestly did not expect the full-on, pretty much nothing left to the imagination rendition of a rather graphic novel. Bravo!
My worries were unfounded: not only was Park Chan-wook able to convey the imagery convincingly, the rather complex story-in-two-parts translated wonderfully. The timeline (30's occupied Korea) the utterly sumptuous settings of the Japanese/European style mansion amidst the almost desolate beauty of the countryside and finally, The strong, character driven story lines acted out by a first rate, suitably gorgeous cast.
As a Japanese speaker, I found the Japanese half of the movie to be blissfully well acted and the Japanese convincing enough, considering the Korean cast... However I was forced to rely on some sub-par subtitling for the Korean half having only sparing knowledge.
Finally, having the original novel and the UK screen version to compare against, If found that the story told here was as triumphant and thoroughly heart-warming ode to trust as was the original and so well adapted to the Korean 30's that it felt truly in place in the sumptuous sets and in the hands of the gorgeous cast.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was a very entertaining movie. While normally in my experience I am not enthralled by historical reenactments, Glory was enrapturing from start to finish. While not all of the movie was full on action, it often portrayed a different struggle; that of the African American soldiers, not against the confederates, but against their unfair treatment by the Union. From lower wages to not being allowed to fight, these struggles were more the focus of the movie than the actual violence. However, there was plenty of both, which kept the movie interesting. Unfortunately, half the characters one would be fond of are killed off in the end. However, sad as this may be, it is accurate to the civil war, and helps reinforce the tragic events of the time period.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Surely, Samuel is a child with special needs. But the school does not understand inclusive education. So he has to find another school.
Surely Babadook has no understanding of inclusion either. It bullies the poor child and his poor single mum, who is already disadvantaged and experiencing middle-age crisis, by haunting them and making their miserable life even more unbearable. Come on! Babadook, can't you find somebody else to haunt? :)
For me, the first half of the movie is great. The problem lies in the second half. I would have liked to see a dark ending. It would have been wonderful to have Babadook-possessed mum kill Samuel and then herself, and let the demon's book pass on to another family. The dark prophecy in the book of Babadook would be fulfilled. Instead, the mother and son defeated the monster, and a happy ending is what we get. This happy ending is just not as interesting.
Perhaps, the filmmaker wanted to make a politically correct horror movie, to draw attention to the socially disadvantaged families? But as a horror movie, it needs to be dark and depressing. It should have taken a darker route.
Not as good as I thought it would be. But not bad, either. The acting, the atmosphere... everything was well done. I only expected to see a dark horror movie like Sinister.
So far, Sinister remains the best horror movie in English. That movie has a dark creepy ending.""Spoilers Ahead:
First, even as theistic existentialist, I must warn fellow people of faith that this movie is guaranteed to offend you. Monty Python's heyday was during the CounterCulture where all the traditional authority figures of society were under assault. If you agree with the philosopher, who said that God plays to an audience that is afraid to laugh, you will enjoy the movie more. The movie's plethora of quotable lines rivals Arthur: it has hundreds of them. The movie, while following the legend fairly well, parodies almost every aspect of the Arthur legend. I will point out the scenes I laughed at the most, hopefully, it will give you the sense of the movie. My header is spoken by the Deity, when he appears to the knights. They begin bowing and scraping, this really irritates Him. ""Oh, stop with the I am not worthy, I am so evil, it is such a bore!"" From bring out your dead, to Cleese trying to rescue someone, at the wrong castle, impaling everyone at a wedding feast and following it up with,""Terribly sorry,"" there are visual scenes that work as well as the dialog. Do not be chased away, the humor is not all sacrilegious, it is also has great fun with politicians. Wait for the economic debate between the peasants who accost King Arthur. He attempts to exclaim that his authority came from God through the lady of the lake giving him Excalibur.
The mocking peasant responds,""There really are more rational systems of government than water logged strumpets distributing swords."" He persists with the argument until Arthur resorts to showing the real basis of all political systems: Violence. Before you watch Python's best movie, ask yourself if you like very zany parodies or satires like Buckaroo Banzai? The movie's tone is relentlessly mocking of pretty much every topic. The lecture on how to tell if a woman is a witch, using the scientific method, is priceless. Look I am religious but the holy hand grenade is funny. He consults the book of armaments,""Throw thou thy holy hand grenade with which you shall blow your enemies into myriads of pieces."" No, if you a devout practitioner any of the earth's major religions and not a goofy philosopher, like your author, I would avoid this movie, it will anger you. My devout Christian parents detested it. Like all artifacts of the Hippie Era, they are having a good time with conventional society. There are a few 'action' moments that are also played for laughs. The famous bridge duel is here over an impossibly small creek. As Arthur begins dismembering the Black Knight, his defiance continues despite losing all of his limbs.
The scene with the killer rabbit is one of Python's funniest scenes: wait until you see it fly through the air and rip this knight's throat out. ""I warned you, it's a killer."" Python's humor is aimed at much at English history as at religion or traditional authority. If you are going to collect these, start with this one. I would then buy: Life Of Brian, Python At The Hollywood Bowl, And Now For Something Completely Different, last, The Meaning Of Life. I love the insurance rebellion, at the beginning of Meaning Of Life, but there are a few stories that do not work so well (Vomit Boy). This is very easy to review for you: Python movies provoke a pure Manichean reaction in viewers: Love or Hate, nothing in between. Usually, two opposing philosophical groups equally detest their movies: Religious people and Empiricists. If you are a realist, who hates abstract thought or imaginative movies, you will find yourself in odd company with devout religious people. For me, Python always makes me laugh: The Knights Who Go Neee!, the singer behind the cowardly knight,""He's running away, he's chickening out, running to fight another day."" Life Of Brian is a very close second for me. This one wins for the sheer number of great one liners where Brian has the classic: Biccus Diccus. A Comedy Legendary Classic. Oh, Stop Groveling! Q.E.D.
""A Little Nonsense, Now And Then, Relished By The Wisest Men."" Willy Wonka""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I was brought this movie way back when I was home sick with the flu. My elder sibling and seen it and told me I'd like it. She was right, (she was also right about my liking Clue, another great 80's movie). The story is not new, but the quirks in it make it interesting. I did enjoy the chases, the mistaken identity and what a sex-crazed idiot Darryl was. (Saw Anthony Rapp in School Ties too, where his performance was near perfect.) I fully enjoy this movie and both of my under-school-age children did too. still watch it to this day, (Goes for Goonies too), and think it is a great family movie. Yes, I thought Joe Gipp was attractive, but more attracted to Keith Coogan, always have been in every movie i have sen him in.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""Dracula"" director Tod Browning's horror movie ""Freaks"" might freak you out unless you're a connoisseur of either Browning or the genre. Based in title only on Tod Robbins' short story ""Spurs,"" this memorable revenge melodrama takes place in a circus touring in Europe. When MGM made this creepy little chiller, they wanted to reap the whirlwind of wealth that Universal Studios had with ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein."" This horror movie doesn't concern supernatural creatures or people, but there are three genuinely deformed individuals. Browning didn't rely on prosthetics or camera tricks. The two most impressive of the 'freaks' is Prince Randian and Johnny Eck. Randian is designed as The Living Torso, while Eck is The Half-Boy. The Living Torso has neither arms nor legs, but he does have a normal size head. The Half-Boy uses his hands to walk around with because he has no legs or even a set of buttocks. The other 'Freaks' are three pinheads and a couple of armless women. The main one of the bunch is a German fellow named Hans (Harry Earles of ""The Unholy Three"") who is basically a pint-sized little guy who dresses himself in formal apparel. He has had a relationship with another circus performer, Frieda (Daisy Earles of ""The Wizard of Oz""), but he breaks it off after he becomes infatuated with high-wire trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova of ""A Dangerous Woman"") who preys on him for his wealth. Eventually, Cleopatra makes a fool out of Hans when she marries him, but prefers to kill him so she can get her inheritance. Once they are man and wife, Cleopatra wages a campaign to poison Hans. Happily, Hans discovers her skulduggery before she can kill him. The sideshow circus carve her up and they go after her muscle-headed accomplice, Hercules, who wrestles bulls in the circus. Clocking in at a learn 63 minutes, this classic horror movie will live on in your conscious mind withhold holding up Zorro. When the film was released after extensive editing, ""Freaks"" flopped at the box office, but it qualifies as a surefire, gross-out classic that you won't forget.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Ever since Brave came out, Pixar has had trouble delivering solid stories, they are good, but not excellent like Ratatouille, Toy Story or The Incredibles. Visually stunning as always, but the story felt a little forced, they killed off the father like 10 minutes into the film, not delivering enough scenes where we could see like the love he had for him, or the good times they spent together, it felt as if something tragic just had to happen so they killed off the dad. It was just like with the elephant from inside out, he vanishes in what is supposed to be an emotional scene, but one did not see the connection he had with the girl, therefore I didn't feel anything when he vanished. Too many characters that appear and disappear, they should have focused more on only arlo and spot, developed more their relationship. Ending was good, but I didn't understand the whole human family stuff. And, arlo arrives and the mother is just there? they didn't go looking for him lol. Far from Pixar's best, but enjoyable, and better than inside out in my opinion.""The Pianist's story is one that grips the viewer and takes them on a gut wrenching ride. Adrain Brodie's performance as the Jewish piano player is one to remember, that is not to say that every other actor in the film was not good in this case they were all great. Even to the smallest characters that are only on screen for a matter of seconds are up to par. Also having the film be based off of a book adds to the amount of detail that the director has put into the film. I am talking about the things Adrian Brodie's character sees throughout the streets during this hard time for him. In the end The Pianist is a great story that is accompanied by great performances. The story of the Holocaust is a topic that should and will not be forgot and The Pianist keeps those who lost their lives in memory.""In the near future, the powerful Umbrella Corporation has a hidden research facility called The Hive underneath Raccoon City, where the scientists develop genetically engineered drugs for medical purpose and biological weapons. After stealing the lethal T-virus, a thief contaminates The Hive and the artificial intelligence Red Queen seals the Hive and kills all the staff and guinea pigs. A woman called Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakes naked in a bathroom of a mansion without memory and soon a commando led by a man called One (Colin Salmon) subdues her and another man called Matt (Eric Mabius), who claims to be a cop. Alice learns that she is a security guard with her partner Spence (James Purefoy) assigned to protect the entrance to The Hive and her memory will return in an undefined period since she was affected by a gas. The Red Queen had a malfunctioning five hours ago and had shut down the facility and killed everybody releasing a lethal gas. Now they need to shut down the Red Queen and restart her systems. They use an underground train to reach The Hive and the Red Queen asks then to leave the place. However Kaplan (Martin Crewes) disables the Red Queen opening the doors in The Hive. Soon the group learns that the staff has turned into zombies and now they are under siege of the zombies. Most of the commando dies and only Alice, Spence, Matt, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Kaplan survive. Now they need to find a way to escape from The Hive since the system will shut down the exits in a short period. Who will survive?
""Resident Evil"" is a great sci-fi action horror film by Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez and the rest of the cast have good performances and the non-stop action is engaging. The gloomy pessimist conclusion fits perfectly to the story. My vote is eight.
Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil: O Hóspede Maldito"" (""Resident Evil: The Damned Guest"")""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The general idea is a prodigy of simplicity: to turn a whole set of successful science-fiction dramas or romances or adventures into a full-blown comedy and make all these frightening things that make you dream of a world that will never exist like in Star Wars or in Star Trek hilariously funny so that the audience just never stops laughing. Steven Spielberg adds to that a direct allusion to Back to the future but within the science fiction space adventure genre and it becomes phony more than funny, with me grown up meeting me four years old.
The first two films are really funny because they remain within one layer of time. The third one becomes something different, nostalgic, sentimental even, and that breaks the fun to turn it into fear: the fear the negated past or the traumatized past may turn the future which is our present into a nightmare, a PTSS case of time travel trauma, something like PTTTSS, Post Time Travel Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Welcome to the asylum for deeply disturbed minds and brains.
The most attractive and fascinating aspect is the phenomenal palette and variety of extra-terrestrials you are navigating among. Obviously all of them are just the figment of the imaginations of a band of deranged probably young people generally called artists though there might be a few older ones who are more perverse than deranged, or perversely corrugated. You cannot find them serious. They are all of them just impossible mixtures of all kinds of living gadgets, except in the last one where one of them is well hidden in a human body and is deadly frightening, not funny at all.
The next element that is striking is the role of the Black man in black, just recruited in the first film, trained and excellently performing and competent in the second film and growing melancholy and sentimental in the last film when he sees himself when he was four, when his father was killed under his adult eyes and when with a magic flash the little boy will only remember his father was a hero. And of course it is his partner who erases the truth from the little boy's memory, the partner he meets again in the present some seconds later at the end of the film. That episode brings the saga to an end because the fun has been drunk right down to the tea leaves at the bottom of the cup.
We all, absolutely all of us, have rebuilt the image of the father we had, in pink or in black, in celestial blue or in fiery red, but what we remember of our father is nothing but a mental reconstruction, a Lego reconstruction. All the pieces are true, real and absolutely precise, but the pieces have been reassembled in any creative or traumatic way and that's the image we have of the man we call our father. That's normal. That's natural. That's the truth if there is one under the sun. Our memory is selective. In fact, we remember everything without fault but our conscious memory is the Lego construction I have just spoken of.
You may have in some drawer, or in your pocket, something that is attached to your father in a way or another and that reached you when you were three or four. This thing is attached to you and you are attached to it in an unbreakable union and yet you don't really know why you're attached to it and it is attached to you. It might be a sentence that comes back regularly and that makes you sick with fear or happy with instant bliss, and yet you do not know where it comes from, except that it comes from a long, long time ago and you still have it in your mind because it was a positive or negative trauma, and, mind you, there are positive happy traumas that have the same power as negative ones, except that this power makes you excel and not run away and hide under your bed.
If you want to have some fun in an environment of extraterrestrial monsters, with some dangerous situations and beings and many happy just in time right in time epiphanies and salvations, you have to let yourself slide into these hairy and over-twisted stories and forget about your bills and the fact that the heating does not work. You'll survive since these crazy characters did survive.
Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU""We loved it - an exciting film for us and took us far away - the 4 elements and one that knows or bend them all - the avatar, a small boy (munk) that hasn't learned to bend all the elements.. really liked it and would love to see what happens next .... that should be soon.... - as it is now 6 years old....so we gotta know what happens next in the fight ...( as in the end its said that it should be 3 years before the firepeople gets extra powers and how will they get that time without the avatar paying them a visit. Not any of the big stars but that doesn't matter if the story is good. loved the ""tai chi"" scenes and looking forward to see the other spirits..""Another in a series of cult-minded horror movies that have been enjoying a renaissance of sorts lately. A dinner party in the Hollywood Hills, between old friends, and an ex-couple with a dead son whom they both grieve in their own ways (ostensibly leading to their divorce).
What happens is an exploration of those classic themes, grief and acceptance, with a a modern twist. Characters are well-drawn, the acting is good to great all around, and there's genuine suspense. What's missing is surprise or newness. With this kind of story it's easy to guess where it's going, and while the ride there is fun and well crafted, it still has that common destination. There's an almost twist at the end, that plays like one, but in reality is nothing but a coda for things to come, and quickly, after that.""Extremely loud and incredibly close is such a gem, I am sad that it took me this long to see it. The cast is excellent, especially Thomas Horn, the main character. The story starts out in a bit of confusion, and you are not quite sure what to expect. Then, slowly over the span of the film, little connections begin to pop up as you begin to make sense of it all. I loved every moment of the film. There are ups, and downs, and everything in between, and even if you have never experienced exactly what Oskar experiences, you feel connected to his character, and you feel just as motivated to resolve his quest as he is. This film is well directed, and the style is amazing. I never felt like I knew what would happen next, and that made me happy. It is a great family film, and there is a very nice message attached to it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After serving in the united states army for 19 years i got to admit:
Either these actors have been serving the army twice the amount of time i did.
Or these actors are natural born killers with their weapons skills.
They have taken the role of the maroon berets (which i trained with during the Nato exercises in Germany) very adequately.
Nice and realistic i prefer more of these kinds of movies. The more realistic war movies are the better.
Of course i gave the ten stars for what Turkey has in movie making.
If it were a Hollywood movie i would have given it 10 stars for realism and 7 stars for the special effects.
Nice movie with badass soldiers how it's suppose to be!
Waiting for the third movie where they show a war on a bigger scale with more of these kinds of soldiers :P
And to be honest it kinda motivated me to join the Euphrates shield operation as a volunteer but wouldn't feel safe between those Ahrar al sham jihadists lol. They might accidentally hit me with an rpg or something""Spoilers Ahead:
I will try my best to review this for you without spoiling it. When you watch the original of a series over, it is fun to spot the features that made it a classic. Here, the mystery of who Jason Bourne is, that is what keeps your interest. From the opening frame, with him floating out in the ocean, the unraveling begins. For those of you who have never seen it, there are a series of clues that lead Jason from place to place. As an audience, we are not sure about him: whether he is a villain or a hero? Marie, the girl who drives him to Paris, shares our ambivalence. Little things start to alert Jason that he is some kind of violent man. When accosted by two cops, on a snowy bench trying to sleep, he easily defeats them with barely any effort. When I just watched this over, I think it was the mystery of who and what he is that was the main feature for its success. There are great action set pieces here. Ambushes out of nowhere that make clear to Bourne that a group of people are following and quite serious about killing him. This first one has a great supporting cast: nobody plays a government creep better than Chris Cooper. Cox (Rob Roy) is his superior, from whom he tries to hide the absolute disaster that Treadstone, the secret mission not explained until the very end, was and who Bourne is.
From the start, at the embassy, there are great chases and narrow escapes. The mystery feature sustains your interest as we, like Marie, ride along with him trying to figure out if he is a dangerous assassin or a victim of a government conspiracy. Damon excels at playing characters that are sympathetic; this movie is no exception. This was such a critical feature, if he had been played by a more sinister actor, say Del Toro, we would have been more suspicious of him. That said, there still are scenes where Marie, and the audience, are taken aback by how well and quickly he kills people. My favorite fight scene is where Jason uses a fountain pen with deadly effect. It is a great example of the power of training over weaponry. The movie is not just a brainless action movie; the director puts a scene of pathos in it when Bourne bests a very young Clive Owen. Clive was sent as a sniper to pick the couple off at a farmhouse. The scene is well done, evocative of that classic: The Parallax View. We see that the agency selects social misfits for their violent operatives, which is quite accurate. I love when Clive, bleeding out, looks up at him,""We work alone, we always work alone.""
Some of the sequels I like more than the others. This one is a no brain-er for me, as a reviewer. The mystery of Bourne's identity, what he was doing out in the ocean, and what the hell Treadstone is: these keep your interest. I read some of the detractors' reviews, they have a point. If you are looking for a pure action movie, this may disappoint you. While it contains some great action scenes, it is, above all, a mystery. Some of the detractors point out the slow parts, which bored them. I just never viewed it as a pure action movie. My eight reflects my level of interest, with periods of great action and good acting. Even into the back of the cast, Cooper and Cox are great. Stiles does a good job, in a small part, looking deeply scared. One of my favorite bit actors, Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Oz, Mummy Returns) plays the African dictator. His part is a small one, but he is always a treat. Imagine The Mummy Returns without him in it? He has a great scene, I won't spoil for you, but it is the moral decision point for Bourne. Even if you disliked some of the sequels, like me, if you have never seen this you are missing a very good movie. A Rare Blend Of Mystery And Action That Works Perfectly. Q.E.D.""I first saw this film when it was released and remember being blown away by the special effects. The hallucinations are brought to life by some extremely clever special effects people (they should have one the Oscar). The knight jumping from the church's stained glass window is fantastic. Even watching it recently, it's absolutely brilliant (it hasn't dated like those effects in Jason and the argonauts/clash of the titans - which are still great films).
The film crops up on TV now and again but recently I watched it with family, telling them how much I had enjoyed it. The young lads playing Holmes and Watson are great to watch (where are they now?) and the rest of the cast is equally as good.
The film is very atmospheric, and lovely to watch; a Victorian London, and a school and dining hall exactly as Harry Potter's - which came some years later. There is some humour, as well as a good story. We see the first meeting of Watson and Holmes and instantly take to them. The stammering, old and slow science teacher is fun to watch, as is the bored reaction of the pupils. Again, very Potterish.
A great film for young and not so young and a good introduction to Holmes.""In my reviews to the first two sequels I harshly criticized the movies, for a reason of course. The first two movies were a disappointment when it comes to action, tension, visual effects and the plot. However, Allegiant is something completely different. I can hardly believe the progress they made since the first two parts of the movie. The plot became much more original and exciting, tension-building devices were awesome, visual effects great and what we have as a result is a a compact whole which works perfectly fine on the screen.
What I really liked about this movie is that it is much richer with emotions and sentiment. Mother's love, family, friendship, betrayal, everything is served here and it really touches your heart. Something I definitely didn't feel with the previous two Divergent movies.
As you can see my rating for the movie is 9/10, because I still don't like the choice of the female protagonist. Her acting got better this time, but still she is such a baby face for the role. And also some parts of the movie were a bit predictable and clichéd. That's why I cannot give it a 10.
But I highly recommend you going through a bit of torturing with the first sequel of the series and a part of the second, because you will be rewarded with the astonishing third part. I hope they will keep up the good work with the last sequel of the movie.
And I am definitely getting the books.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Resourceful and determined scientist Robert Neville (a fine and credible performance by Will Smith) does his best to keep his sanity and find a cure for a deadly contagion that has either wiped out most of mankind or turned the ones who are left into murderous nocturnal mutants.
Director Francis Lawrence, working from a compact and compelling script by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman, keeps the absorbing story moving along at a constant pace, brings an impressive sense of tremendous scope to the premise (the expansive shots of an empty and desolate New York City are extremely striking and jarring), and ably crafts a powerfully unsettling mood of pure dread and despair. Moreover, the strong bond between Neville and his fiercely loyal canine companion Sam (well played by the beautiful German Shepherds Abbey and Kona) gives this film plenty of touching heart and warmth. Smith plays it serious and straight for once with remarkably spot-on results, Alice Braga lends sturdy support as soulful survivor Anna, Dash Mihok cuts an appropriately fearsome figure as the savage lead alpha male mutant, and Emma Thompson has a nice uncredited bit role as the well-meaning doctor whose cancer cure inadvertently beget the virus. Kudos are also in order for Andrew Lesnie's sharp widescreen cinematography and James Newton Howard's spare chilling score. Alas, the CGI creatures and wild animals look really cartoonish and unconvincing while the bittersweet ending fails to wrap things up in a satisfying manner. Those flaws aside, this film overall sizes up as a real on the money sci-fi/horror end-of-the-world winner.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Oz was an original movie so I don't really get why it got an average of 4/10. It was also really funny and authentic.
First of all, this movie was pretty original. When you think of the Wizard of Oz you think of Dorothy, the tin man and the lion. You don't think of a charming imposter con man wizard played by James Franco, a flying monkey and a china girl. The important thing is that this cast works very well. I have nothing more to say then that it was very entertaining. Especially the last scene which has Oz using his con man skills to fool everyone into thinking he's powerful. There was also very beautiful animation once they get into oz. They really outdid themselves to make the land of Oz look beautiful.
Second of all, this movie was hilarious. From the flying monkey to everything Oz does, it's hilarious. James Franco was perfect for this role.
Third of all, this movie had an authentic Wizard of Oz feel. From the first act which was in black and white to the yellow brick road, it all feels like the Wizard of oz. Of course I'm not really in a position to say this but my mom is a huge fan of the 1930's original and she said it was a great representation.
Unfortunately while the movie is 90% of the time quite original, it's also a little generic at times. I found the inclusion of generic witches too similar to Cinderella and every other Disney movie unoriginal.
This movie is extremely underrated and I think that the authenticity, the acting, the humour and the originality make it worthwhile. You should watch it.""As a fan of Heinlein, this movie (based on his work All You Zombies)was a fun ride. This review will contain no spoilers. I do warn you though to go into this film without the need to understand EVERYTHING. There might be a few things that just do not make sense to you. That is OK, considering a movie that is based on time travel is apt to do. I pride myself on seeing plot twists prior to the actual event. This movie was able to perform a ""magic trick"" by keeping your attention over to one side while preparing a different surprise on the the other. Well done. Time travel movies always have a paradox in them. Instead of trying to seep that paradox under the rug or trying to explain it, Predestination uses it as it's main plot line. I found myself trying to relate the story to some friends and found the task highly difficult. Hawke was solid in his role and Snook was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended.""A divorced father (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother (Ben Foster) resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's ranch in West Texas.
Although this is only the first (of nine) Best Picture nominees I have watched, I feel it may hold the distinction of being the most exciting. The typical winners are heavy on drama, or perhaps are socially conscious. This nominee defies that. And while I don't expect it to win, I am glad it will get a little extra attention.
Best Supporting Actor Jeff Bridges? I love Jeff Bridges. Everyone loves Jeff Bridges. The Academy loves him, too. It's too early to say, but I don't see this as being a win for him. He is great as the old, crotchety, semi-racist Texas ranger... but it's not one of those mind-blowing roles that really get noticed. There was no special makeup or voice alteration required. I would love to see Bridges be honored, but I doubt it.
Best Screenplay? This would also be great to see. Although the basic plot is simple -- brothers robbing banks to purchase the family farm -- the intricacies are wonderful, such as why certain banks are targeted, and the way the brothers ""launder"" the money. I was not a fan of some of the heavy-handed messaging. The idea that the American military stole from the Indians, and now the banks stole from the American people. The message itself is fine, but the way they were so blunt about it by having Alberto express the exact sentiment... it sort of dumbed everything down.
Best Editing? It is my opinion that editing is very hard to judge. Unless you are an editor, you may not know what goes into the job. Also, the best editing should be flawless, and not obvious in a film. For this second reason, I would gladly hand over the best editing award to this film, because the editing was indeed very smooth, and the pace was excellent. Some movies drag at 90 minutes. This one, with its pace, could have been three hours and still enjoyable. Surely the editing is at least partially to thank.""I'm not going to write a detailed movie review, there are already over 400! It's a great movie, worth a watch certainly. I'd encourage you to read the books though - that's a very different experience and will allow you to join the 'is Tom Cruise a suitable choice for Jack Reacher' debate! :) This first Reacher movie was based on the book 'One Shot' - you can find a summary of this book on the book summary site, WellRead. Take a look.. http://www.wellread.eu/? ASIN=0857502689
Here is just a small snippet from that book summary.
This explosive ninth instalment of the Jack Reacher series, finds Reacher mid travel, drinking coffee and watching the news which runs a story of a fatal shooting of several civilians in small town Indiana. The gunman, James Barr an ex-military sniper is under arrest....""Oliver Twist is a poor orphan, living at a workhouse. He angers the powers-that-be at the workhouse when, one dinner, he asks for more food. They decide to sell him and he ends up working for an undertaker. The undertaker treats him badly and he escapes, heading for London. Once there he falls in with a gang of boys, thieves who steal for their adult leader, Fagin.
Great musical adaptation of Oliver Twist, the Charles Dickens novel. I'm generally not into musicals but this works. The music isn't overdone and fits in well with the story, plus it propels the story along.
Good performances all round.
Won the 1969 Best Picture Oscar.""The first time you watch it, you may expect it to be like the first 300 movie. In fact, it is, but it's story line is developing in parallel with the first one, and is different.
Because of some expectations, it's at the second watching that I've been really able to admire all the beauty and the perfection of this second story.
Everything in this movie is perfect. The actors are fabulous, the costumes are beautiful, the soundtrack is marvellous, and all the work they put into the visual effects, make every shot a feast for the eyes.
I mean, seriously, you could stop the movie at any frame and it would make a poster of it. It's how beautiful and perfect it is.
So forget all the negative reviews, and watch it by yourself, and if possible, twice.""Turn off the lights, lock your eyes on the screen and be dazed. This brutally honest visualization of life will burn itself into your head.
Gaspar Noé has made a movie like no other i have seen before. The closest comparison may be ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", yet incredibly this movie even transcends Kubricks nauseating travel through space and time. ""Enter the Void"" has not a single traditional shot, but slowly floats through life and death of the main protagonist, flashing at you its neon lights and taking you through grimy streets. It is, as the movie proclaims itself, ""the greatest trip of all"", and leaves drug-filled Tokyo as flickering backdrop, while exposing the viewer to every harsh, brutal, sexual, desperate, panicked, euphoric and dirty facet of life.
There is no hiding from the imagery presented, no pretending, no being above it. As foreign and shocking as the life shown may be to you, it is entirely human, entirely real.
What aspects you will take away from this experience i can not tell you, but there are many moments to ponder, many traumas to relate to.
Ultimately, what ties ""Enter the Void"" to movies you have seen before, is the overarching idea of life and death. The human spirit transcending any individual life. A message tackled before, but never before delivered so shockingly honest.
""Enter the Void"" is a great, great work of art. Be open to experience something uncomfortable, shocking and unfamiliar, and you'll be rewarded with a life lesson you will never forget.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Resident Evil: Extinction picks up where the previous one (RE: Apocalypse) left off. What's left of the world is a deserted (both in terms of emptiness and the desert) and Alice is pretty much moving,killing, and surviving. Her and a new group of survivors (one, an old friend from the previous movie) decide to try and head for a place in Alaska (they start off in Vegas) called ""Arcadia"". The movie is a cross between Resident Evil, Mad Max and the Birds (watch the movie to figure out that last comparison!), and it is one hell of a ride! At the end of the movie, Alice kills Doctor Isaacs (not really) and finds all her clones and vows to use them to go after Umbrella and shut them down for good!
FINAL VERDICT: In terms of video game-movie adaptations, this one isn't very true-to-the-games (maybe a little like RE5 because it takes place in the desert). But again, if you like action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls or all of the above...you'll LOVE this movie""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have loved this movie from the first time I saw the Grady twins. Almost everybody has some sort of relationship with this film, I am one of those who never actually looked at this as a horror movie. I was around 12 years old when I first saw it, and found it to be more of a creepy drama thriller.
I have since the first viewing read both books and loved them, but also realized that I might have been right in that I always viewed it as a creepy drama thriller. In the book you get a whole new side of Jack with details from his own childhood and not to mention all the details about the Overlook hotel.""According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

Martin Campbell did everything right with this film (well this time...we don't talk about ""The Legend of Zorro"" here...).
It's incredibly well made, the cinematography is fantastic, the soundtrack by James Horner is very fitting and great as always and all the actors giving top performances.
The action sequences are exceptionally great, we know from Campbells Bond-movies that he does a good job, but this movie does way more than that. It's fast and energetic, all stunts are real and nothings covered through fast editing or anything.
Also the romance is great, because both characters are strong and likable.
And this movie is much darker and dramatic then most of the movies which came out recently (*cough* Rogue one *cough*), but also lighthearted enough to never feel depressing, but entertaining as hell.
This is my favourite Martin Campbell movie, and these are my favourite performances by Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Anthony Hopkins to date.
If you like classic movies with romance, drama, adventure and great training montages, then this is the film for you...""The sheer volume of prolific writer/director/actor Woody Allen's back catalogue means that any new work will always have audiences comparing them to his earlier, more universally-acclaimed pictures. Born in 1935, it has been over fifty years since his first peek behind the camera with What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966), and he still pumps out roughly a film per year. The declining quality doesn't help either, with (before Midnight in Paris) his only truly excellent film being the incredibly sexy Vicky Christina Barcelona (2008) since 1999's charming Sweet and Lowdown. Perhaps he had the idea for years, but it felt like Allen may be having a sly pop at the nostalgia-fiends feeding off his past glories with Midnight in Paris, a heart-warming and funny exploration of a writer pining for a bygone age.
Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a successful Hollywood screenwriter holidaying in Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams). He is also struggling with his first novel, about a man working in a nostalgia shop, and his bride-to-be isn't helping matters by insisting they spend time with her rich, conservative parents and her annoying, know-it- all friend Paul (Michael Sheen). Gil feels like he belongs in a different decade, namely 1920's Paris, where the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Salvador Dali enjoyed decadent parties and frequented the boisterous bars. On a walk one night, Gil is approach by an old-fashioned taxi as the clock strikes midnight, and the passengers beckon him to join them. Soon enough, he is chatting with the likes of Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his wife Zelda (Alison Pill), as Cole Porter (Yves Heck) plays piano.
As Gil's nightly visits to the 1920's play out, a wealth of famous faces bring other famous faces to life. The likes of Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and Dali (Adrien Brody) all brush shoulders with the awestruck writer, as well as the mysterious Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a muse of Picasso who catches his eye. The fantastic performances aside - Stoll is a particular revelation - Paris itself is a star of the movie, akin to what Allen did may times with his New York-set films. It's certainly overly-romanticised, but this only serves to heighten Gil's sense of wonder, and he is hopeless romantic after all. Midnight in Paris is Allen's wittiest, warmest and most effortlessly entertaining films since 1994's Bullets Over Broadway. It may be difficult to avoid comparing this to the director's classic works, but Midnight in Paris sits easily as one of his best.""In this film, a mother tries to educate her two children by herself, protecting them from a mysterious illness that causes them great sensitivity to intense lights, such as sunlight. While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolated in a Channel Islands mansion, keeping the house in partial darkness along with three mysterious servants. The lead role is played by Nicole Kidman, who does a brilliant performance in a character who sometimes seems very loving, almost needy, and other times seems unusually hard. But she's just a woman trying to bear a burden that seems heavy: the burden of carrying everything back while her husband is away. The children are equally interesting: played by James Bentley and Alakina Mann, two very competent young actors, they are naive, sweet but also very mischievous, and their mischief contributes greatly to the suspense, especially the girl. She seems to know something that nobody else knows or to have a particularly sharp intelligence. The father, played by Christopher Eccleston, is almost a mere figure. He is purposely an absent character who is permanently present for the simple fact of all the others are constantly speaking of him, and this absence has great importance to the psyche of his wife. But the true life of this film is borrowed by Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes who (along with Elaine Cassidy) give life to the house servants. The way they acted and how counter-acted with Kidman is brilliant, giving the film a deeply conspiratorial atmosphere. The constant darkness, the gas lights, the huge old house, the permanent haze surrounding the grounds are cliché elements that give the film a touch of elegance and help the audience to grab to the movie until the end, which is quite unexpected and disconcerting.""Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" is an absolutely, amazingly fun time. The concept of the Gremlins themselves being so intriguing and fun, and face it, Gizmo is one of the cutest creatures in cinema history. While this movies first 20 minutes are a bit boring, once the story and absolute fun insanity begins you'll be having such a good time that the run time of the film will completely slip by. I have loved this film since a young age, and sure it may be nostalgia, but god do I really love this movie. I highly recommend watching this on a cold winter night, with hot chocolate, and a warm bowl of popcorn. I guarantee that you will have a fun time with this. It's not a thought provoking film, it won't change your life, but it is a fun ride , completely worth it's length""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Blake Edwards was a reigning king of comedy during the 1960s with the immense success of ""The Pink Panther"" films. The director outdid himself with this zany comedy about two competing stuntmen (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) who enter an around-the-world race to prove who is the better man. The competing racers have to deal with the numerous booby traps set by one of them, the natural elements of the global terrains their vehicles traverse and a persistently pesky suffragette reporter (Natalie Wood) who soon falls in love with the good guy stuntmen.
The film's leading players are all hilariously entertaining from Tony Curtis as the straight-man (similiar to his role in ""Some Like It Hot"") 'The Great Leslie', Jack Lemmon as the outlandish and hysterically wacky Professor Fate, Peter Falk as Lemmon's bumbling assistant Max and a lovably snarky Natalie Wood as persistent and pretty Maggie DuBois. A colorful set of supporting characters like Keenan Wynn as The Great Leslie's friend and assistant, there's Maggie's newspaper boss who is reluctant to hire a woman but does due to his suffragette wife as well as wildly eccentric minor characters along the global race.
Henry Macini's zany musical score fits perfectly with the film's humor. It is cartoonish at times, but is complimented with lush melodies for tender moments. The score is boosted by Johnny Mercer's Oscar nominated 'Sweetheart Tree' which is sung by Maggie (sung by another actress, not star Natalie Wood) after a zany escape.
The best comedic lines from the film are uttered by comedy legend Jack Lemmon as Professor Fate as his schemes humorously fail and he constantly berates Peter Falk's Max. There are memorable exchanges between straight-man Tony Curtis and the snarky Natalie as they spar in a verbal battle of the sexes (just watch the 'duel' scene). You can't walk away from this film without quoting certain lines, particularly Jack Lemmon's iconic ""Push the button, Max!""""If you've ever seen and liked an xXx movie, then this is definitely for you. If not, know what to expect, and you'll have a damn good time.
xXx isn't a series of movies that's too deep. The premise of this one is as in the first one, Xander Cage is an adrenaline-junkie with an extreme skillset who chases women and stunt thrills like a dog chases sticks, all while smiling.
The NSA has an unconventional problem, and therefore needs this unconventional man, to help save the day.
Despite some less-than-stellar CGI, and a somewhat messy (as in blurry and hard to follow) fight in act 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage is an over-the top action movie that showcases men and women having fun, breaking the law, and saving the world while doing it.
If you're after a realistic movie with depth and subtleties, go look at something else. This is a world where stuntmen/women and extreme sport athletes use their skills as super powers on the level with Captain America, and the NSA collateral damage insurance likely is on the level of a small country's GDP.
This is basically a comic book movie, and while some of the jokes are seen a mile away, it's genuinely funny. The standout opening action sequence puts the entirety of Assassin's Creed to shame, mostly due to Donnie Yen.
If you you can dig a movie like that, you should really, really like xXx: The Return of Xander Cage.""This feelgood movie continues to be warm and cozy, as it tells the story of a really good and honorable man who just wants to travel the world, but never gets the chance because of poor circumstances. Great acting (especially Jimmy Stewart), great villain, great message, and feelgood. While it's an old movie, it never gets old. The message is as current today as it ever was. We need to stop expecting a fairy tale life, so that we can see the beauty in the life that we have. I don't even with it was made in color, because I feel the black and white adds an extra layer of that special feeling of tradition. While the movie is two hours long, it never feels that long. I rate it a 9, but could have given it a 10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Although I haven't seen all Kubrick's movies, I dare to say that this is his magnum opus and probably one of the most brilliant anti- war manifest that art gave us. I feel that there's a lot to praise on this movie as a political satire: game theory reasoning of mutual assured destruction collapses due to a single insane individual whose power to destruct comes from a bureaucrat military protocol, that was supposed to insure the nation in case of a cataclysm; blinded military diligence leads to kamikaze and mass destruction; institutionalized hatred of the communists is exposed to absurd; the cold war leads to hysteria and self destructive behavior. The best thing is that such achievements are conjugated with an incisive literary content. Humor moments are abundant and each character seems to exactly fit its purpose. The story fails on cold war leading to nuclear holocaust but it is surely successful on capturing its dangers, its hysterical, tense and prejudiced environment and the disruptive political and military behavior associated with it. Since the early 1960's a lot of more visually and sonorously appealing movies were made, even by Kubrick himself, and cinema has assuredly evolved a lot since then but unfortunately, not many examples of such a brilliant combination of storytelling, artistic expression and art as a mean of intervention appeared since Strangelove.""Now that is a movie that everyone needs to see. It relates the life of three women, but in their tracks the life of millions of blacks who have contributed to American culture and success.
The cast is outstanding, the music off the hook. The cinematography spotless. Dream-like. The right combination of colors and light. A beauty.
It also shows that intelligence connects beyond gender and race. I am referring to the roles - one/played by Costner and 2/ the part of Glenn Allen that show that true intelligence fosters tolerance, and it brings the human race forward.
The story is touching, and it might spark a love for mathematics in you--even if you come from anti-nerd matter!
No need to mention that the trinity Spencer, Monae, Hensen are as bright as the stars they are trying to reach in the movie. Costner true to himself is an incarnation of tolerance and genius as i remembered him in the Bodyguard. And the guy who plays Glenn Allen is candy for the eye: these two remind us that there are some nice folks out there--and that intelligence breaks all barriers.
Truly stimulating for the mind--one of the best movie I have seen lately (after SPOTLIGHT, same level)
This movie deserves all possible awards;for it is just ""avant-garde"", in the style, the content, and the strength it oozes!
Came out the day of my birthday--Epiphany. That has to mean something! Support that gem of a movie!""Every Thing is normal because it is familiar to you not because it is normal. Do you wanna understand what this means?! Just GO and see the is masterpiece.
A very emotional experience that deserves all of our respect. You wouldn't even Know what is the best thing in the movie, Is it the acting, Is it the emotion? Is it the screenplay ? Is it Jack ?! I think it's definitely Room.
You are about to watch a new respectable talent of a 9 years old boy Jacob Tremblay who had shown me the best performance by a young actor I have ever seen, and we cannot forget our academy award winner Brie Larson who definitely deserved every award she got.
This movie deserves every minute of your time.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Titan A.E. is my favourite (hand-drawn) animated movie of all time!
The movie is visually stunning as hell, the mixing between 2D and 3D animation is perfect, very fluid and some of the most beautiful you will ever see.
The action sequences are amazing, fast paced and surprisingly violent.
The story is very streamlined, grim and investing, also because of the great characters. Which is also due to the voice-talents: Ron Perlman, Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, Bill Pullman and Janeane Garofalo.
The soundtrack is fantastic, the rock music is typical for the early 2000's but (also) works surprisingly well, and the orchestral music by Graeme Revell is one of his finest work.
If there is one weakness, it would be that the second act is very fast paced, but that's less a real negative as something that sticks out, because the first and last act take their time.
All in all, the most beautiful,cool, adult and engaging (hand-drawn) animated film ever..."This movie will forever be ingrained in my mind as one of the best movies i have ever seen.2003 was undoubtedly a great year for movies and this work of art will be one of the most memorable movies of the decade. I won't lie I started to develop mixed emotions about Sam and Frodo and their mental health but i know and understand that they were under large amounts of pressure at the time if their magical quest through amazing environments which never ceased to amaze my mind.This was a great one that will go down in my book as one of the greatest of this centuary and i will never forget the magical direction which lead me to believe that maybe one day i should take up a career in directing. However directing is hard so i decided to become a movie reviewer instead."Most of us remember David Jansen as the fugitive, Richard Kimble. Every episode was another hiding place, another near escape. Barry Morse's Gerard was tireless, obsessed. So now we have Harrison Ford, whose facial expressions of pain and anguish are priceless. He is the perfect victim of a crime he did not commit. He is formidable, like Indiana Jones, but always looking over his shoulder. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard has that itch he needs to scratch. He is utterly determined to get Kimble. He continually puts himself in danger, risking his life for his cause. He is like Javert in ""Les Miserable,"" where the job supersedes all else. The close calls and the gyrations Gerard must perform to continue his pursuit are almost superhuman. Kimble is left with only one option. He must find the one-armed man and prove he committed the murder. This is a marvelous adventure film which should appeal to nearly every taste.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is an awesome psychological horror movie about mental illness, guilt, suppression and bipolar depression. The movie's portrayal is subtle, yet so nuanced everything seems ambiguous. But with mental illness and bipolar depression, sometimes psychotic symptoms occur. It can include delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations. Which means, people with bipolar depression can sometimes hear or see stuff that isn't there. Or imagine stuff happening that hasn't happened. Also sometimes with bipolar disorder comes along paranoia. But that one isn't really important here, so let us concentrate on the delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations. So why are you talking about bipolar disorder, you might ask. Well the movie is about mental illness and bipolar disorder. So the movie is not about ghosts or the supernatural. Su-mi - played beautifully by Im Soo-jung - suffers exactly that. She is suffering from bipolar disorder. That is why she kept having those auditory and visual hallucinations. Which is also why she was in an mental institution in the first place. Oh, did I mention bipolar disorder can run in the family?
Well, it does. Sometimes the children of people who have had bipolar inherits it. Here is another fact: women tend to get bipolar more often than men. See where I am going here? It means Su-mi inherited her mental illness from her mother. Which explains why Su-mi's mother was taking pills and why she committed suicide in the first place. (People with bipolar disorder have bigger chances of committing suicide). Couple that with Su-yeon - Su-mi's sister - died in a freak accident when she found her dead mother and got stuck between the closet/corpse of her mother and the floor, which led to Su-mi getting bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is as genetically heritable as it is environmental. So with Su-mi's mother being mentally ill and Su-mi having chances for inheriting it and it was triggered by an environmental factor. Which was the death of her mother and sister. There is by the way also strong indications for Eun-joo being mentally ill. First of all, she was taking pills. Second of all, she had a visual hallucination, seeing Su-yeon under the kitchen table as a ghostly apparition. What it meant was she was feeling guilt for not trying to save Su-yeon when she was suffocating under the closet.
So the movie is not about ghosts or superstition. It is about mental illness. Why do you think that the men are struggling so desperately to try and help them cope? They are not ""seeing"" ghosts like the women do because they are not mentally ill. Remember, I wrote women tend to get it more often than men. It does not mean men don't get it too. Women are just more prone to it. But anyway, this is a brilliant portrayal of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder. It does have exaggerated parts, but it is a movie after all. I think this might be my favorite psychological horror movie. 10/10 P.S. I watched this movie only once. I need to watch it again.""I admit it. Maybe this will rather say something about myself, than the movie, but I thought ""Blue Velvet"" was very funny. There is some trivia here on IMDb, that says Lynch was laughing uncontrollably at the first scene between Rossellini and Hopper. I totally understand that. While I wasn't laughing uncontrollably, I was quite amused. And that feeling held on throughout the whole movie. In part this is a classic detective mystery story twisted through Lynch's unique sense for shaping reality. Indeed, what we see here can be recognized as reality, just with a little spin. Lynch's Spin. There is a lot of horror in ""Blue Velvet"". In fact, this movie has some serious undertones bubbling up and revealing themselves. It's a game of cover and reveal, illusion and disillusion. But although the main story line is tragic in many ways, ""Blue Velevet"" never becomes that. It's always kind of removed from the horror. Maybe it's because of the absurdity of some scenes. Definitely it's because of the script, the dialogue and the characters which represent classic roles with some lynchian oddity attached to them. What can I say? ""Blue Velvet"" is worth a visit. It's straightforward and not as twisted as later movies by Lynch and I believe the director would agree, that it is supposed to be positive, enjoyable movie. One can feel that he himself did certainly enjoy making it.""I admit that I was skeptical at the prospect of Jonah Hill making a serious film, but boy was I in for a surprise.
The trailer made this film look like a weird drama comedy, something like Knocked Up with an inverted comedy to drama ratio (Knocked Up is maybe 80% comedy, 20% drama), playing up the funny/wacky Jonah Hill parts. The love/relationship aspect of David Packouz could've gone the wrong way and could've gone on for too long, but I think they got everything right.
Without spoiling anything (I'm saying what the trailer shows)
The business part was fun and intriguing. Smart use of montages to cut time and tell the story quickly, something similar to Breaking Bad's cooking/growing business montages.
Their adventures were just the right amount. Enough fun/action/outdoors to not make this a claustrophobic office film where deals are done on phones/faxes/internet.
The personal story between the two was good. The family drama, although not my favorite part, made the stakes higher and made everything personal.
Shady characters, shady wars, grey market, dirty business and you've got yourself a great picture.
There's enough comedy to cut through the drama and not make this a heavy piece.
Some may fault it for not saying anything about the war, but it didn't need to. Not everything needs to be an anti-war piece, just as not every film needs to be some chest- thumping flag-'n-anthem patriotic tear-jerking ode. I like that it did neither - this is not some ""USA USA"" film nor some lecturing film that tells us war is bad, or that the Iraq was is bad, something almost everyone agrees with ALREADY (and the rest won't change their minds because of a Jonah Hill film, so why should we all suffer?).
This film reminds me of Wolf of Wall Street more than anything, but it has shades of Casino, American Gangster, Catch Me If You Can and American Hustle.
I would rate it higher than Wolf of Wall Street, which is too choreographed and theatrical for my taste. This film doesn't overdo this ""look how rich we've become"" because it didn't need to.
The story is front and center. There is no time wasted on lavish parties, fireworks, champagne, women in bikinis, etc. It is not a ""homes of the rich"" and arms-dealer mashup. It's just the story of the arms dealers.
One of the best films of the year.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I've watched Apocalypse Now multiple times since I first saw it, and it gets better and better each time. Every time I take something new from it. It is a masterpiece, certainly the greatest war film ever made and certainly one of the greatest films ever made regardless of genre. Apocalypse Now shows the human condition pushed to the limit in times of war, excellently adapting the classic novel ""Heart Of Darkness"" and giving it a new setting of the Vietnam War as a way of showing the slippery slope into darkness and insanity that could happen to any of us.
The film pushes the limits when it comes to showing just how insane everyone was in Vietnam, reflected not only in Robert Duvall's insane Colonel Bill Kilgore and Marlon Brando's deliciously insane and poetic Colonel Kurtz but in the journey undertaken by Captain Willard and his men across the river, which geniusly represents their slide into insanity and doom the closer they get to their goal.
Heart Of Darkness was the perfect novel for Coppola to adapt in order to show the horrors of Vietnam, as everything from Kurtz' attitude to the war and the hypocrisy of leaders and the true horrors of war itself are perfectly reflected with the Vietnam war, a war which Coppola felt was ""Heart Of Darkness coming true"" The film has one classic sequence after another to add to its legacy: The opening montage set to ""This Is The End"" by The Doors, The exhilarating and shocking ""Ride Of The Valkyries"" Helicopter attack, Kilgore's iconic, passionate and disturbing speech about how he sees the war, the mind-numbingly depressing riverboat sequence, ""Do you know who is in charge here?"", the deaths of each of the major characters the further they go, the arrival at the camp, the thought provoking conversations between Willard and Kurtz, ""The Horror....The Horror"" and of course the haunting final shots before everything fades to black.
We all know the hell Coppola himself went through in getting this film made through a protracted and stressful production littered with problems from drug use to Marlon Brando's attitude to the problems with the military equipment they'd rented, but it was all worth it in the end.
Apocalypse Now is more than just a great war movie that shows the horrors of war. It is also a movie that exposes the true depths of the darkness that lays inside all of us.
One of the greatest films ever made.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Just as every sequel, Back to the Future Part 2 faces the challenge to make up for the missing element of surprise. Even though a lot of creativity was put into the movie, the bigger concept is already known from the first part. Gladly the Back to the Future series has some more things to offer, mainly the warm atmosphere it creates alongside with likable characters that are easy to cheer for.
All in all I really wasn't disappointed by this film. I felt entertained and it didn't really have lengths. I would even consider watching it again after some time.
What bothered me a bit though are the plot holes. In a world where everything changes out of smallest decisions how likely is it that the sports results remain the same? Also the rules for people remembering about their time travel seem a bit vague. In a movie that's centered around that theory, I would have expected the crew to consider that.
Nonetheless, if you are looking for some easy, heart-warming entertainment, this is it.""I would rank this as Hayao Miyazaki's second best work, only after Princes Mononoke. In much the same spirit as Princes Mononoke a young heroine takes on political conflict and environmental devastation in a retro-sci- fi/fantasy world. The real wonder of this movie comes in the details, richness and charm, which are truly enchanting and unforgettable.
Sadly this movie has gone largely unnoticed by anime fans and Hayao Miyazaki fans alike. My guess was that it came out too far ahead of its time for fans to fully appreciate. Many of these story elements have been recycled in later films, anime and games. Still I believe this moving truly stands apart from the crowd of media that used similar concepts.""It is a testimony to a collective failure of humanity in the modern world especially considering the volume of massacre and the reach of Nazi Germany. At the same time, it is also a phenomenal display of hope and extraordinary courage through actions of certain individuals while staring down at an impending ruthless torture and certain death. Though the oppressions of Nazi rule against Jews is well documented (even though it is never enough), their brutality against Czhechs is never highlighted as it could have been. This movie intends to change that with a crash course on history engulfed around a thrilling main plot to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, the architect behind the Final Solution.
Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) and Josef Gabcík (Cillian Murphy) are sent by the Czech government-in-exile to assassinate Nazi Germany 3rd-in- command SS Officer Reinhard Heydrich, which is code named Operation Anthropoid. They take refuge in Moravec's residence, a family of Czech resistance sympathizers from where they do the recce of Heydrich's movements. While the local resistance group led by Uncle Hajský (Toby Jones) and Ladislav Vanék (Marcin Dorocinski) does support them despite their internal varying opinions about the impact and consequence, the day to execute the operation gets preponed due to an intel about recall of Heydrich back to Berlin. Are they ready to go through with the operation?
A retelling of such a historically prominent story requires the right perspective, right tone and also should capture the emotions right to strike a chord with the audience. Anthropoid starts in the right direction with utmost sincerity but seems to have faltered somewhere in between that I can't quite place. Though featuring a large ensemble cast with only a few relatively known faces does help with its narrative to let the audience just see the characters. The production values and art direction are solid which brings the period to life with attention to detail and setting up most scenes in the interiors does help too. Instead of being a deviation, the romantic subplots acts as a window to the assassin's emotional state of mind. There are some moments which are not for everyone, especially the torture sequence of Ata, the 17 year old son of Mrs. Moravec which is gritty and impactful.
While it is a solidly made historical action thriller, a critical view does bring forth some aspects which could have been better. The climax showdown shows the highly trained fully equipped German soldiers going down like ninepins when confronted by the Czech resistance with just their pistols and submachine guns. The entire narrative when looking at it in retrospect does pan out sentence by sentence from Wikipedia, a little non-linear approach in terms of script could have elevated it a bit. A standard Hollywood gimmick to establish hope before curtailing it comes to the fore when the escape route from the church to the sewers was discovered, or when Ladislav finalizes the coffins under which he plans to smuggle the refuges out of the church. These events possibly might not have happened and does stuck out like a sore thumb. But you never know, sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction.
A well-crafted historical action thriller that brings forward a tragically prominent story with high emotional resonance.""In a century where few horror movies stand out, we have ""Babadook,"" the film that tells the story of Amelia (Essie Davis), a single mother who creates a troublesome son by herself, causing depression, anguish, and anger. With sections reminiscent of Repulsa (64) and the Enlightened One (80), ""Babadook"" is a script show, all the characters are absurdly well built, and it looks like the movie only has an hour and a half. For many moments we forget the supernatural, because what terrifies us is the life of Amelia, and the film becomes so human that when the supernatural comes, we really get scared, a story where the human aspect of the characters are very well built in the Making me forget the supernatural and mystery, we can say that it is a script that Stephen King would approve, I confess that I went to watch the film for a recommendation of a friend, and with a certain prejudice, but the photograph of the film won me completely in the first 5 minutes, This extremely dark photograph with a palette of colors turned to gray, from the first minute something in the film bothers you, with a precise soundtrack and brilliant performances, Essie Davis is frighteningly perfect, and Noah Wiseman makes you believe in his madness only with You look at it. The big mistake of the movie is his third act, all of it is a sin, in trying to fight against the bad he relieves himself and puts himself at the level of all other mediums for bad horror films. Of course the film has a message, it's all an allegory, the monster is much deeper than just a monster, it's all an analogy behind involving depression and madness, but the movie that has its first two great acts, And a third dumb and simple that normalizes and disappoints, but it is worth very much, although the film is no longer genius due to sheer lack of imagination, the script is given to the common in the last minutes. But lastly, ""Babadook"" is worth it, because it is mostly different, and for lovers of terror, it is a delight.""My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. We've probably watched it 6 or 7 times. It still makes us laugh. I decided to rate it since it had such bad ratings. When you have children you really look at kid movies differently. Children like to watch movies again and again. So you have to hope it's something you don't mind watching. Some of the movies are so boring or they have parents dying or are just scary. This movie was just fun. I can't believe people are expecting a logical plot from this type of movie.
The child actors in this movie all do a great job. The aliens are goofy and silly. The teenage sister and her boyfriend are annoying. But that's okay. The writing is okay. The parents are as dumb as parents usually are in this type of movie. Nana is hilarious.""Describing this film is actually proving to be more than a challenge. The only thing I can think to say is that it was stunning, for lack of a better word. It starts off a bit slow-paced and the plot takes a while to pick up, but when it finally does take off, it really turns into something special. The cinematography is absolutely breath- taking, the plot really hits home, and McConaughey's performance honestly brought tears to my eyes. There's truly so many different reasons as to why this movie worked so well. Hopefully I'm not hyping this one up if I say that Interstellar may very well be one of the greatest science-fiction films of all time.""Forrest Gump is definitely one of the best movies ever made.
It's truly a masterpiece from Robert Zemeckis. It is about an innocent, loyal, humble, honest, modest man. He does everything with good heart and reaches success for life.
Although it's an adapted movie from a novel having same name, the movie and the book are very different. For me, it is the only example that shows an adapted movie can be far better than the original book.
It has also one of the best performances from Tom Hanks. Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field are also very good.
""Forrest Gump"" says that doesn't matter if you are different. It doesn't matter if you have a handicap. Even if you are in a position of disadvantage you don't have to be depressed. All that you need is optimism, determination and maybe a little bit of luck.""The movie's plot, scenes and events in the movie were very exciting and kept my attention the whole
The story told the events of the Union side when adding in a black regiment and kept it pretty accurate from a historical standpoint, possible one of the most realistic civil war movie (which there is not a lot of civil war movies since most war movies focus on WW2)
Really captures the prejudice they faced on the Union side and focuses on what the characters are going through rather not just the battle itself.
A good watch for anyone interested in a good, historical movie""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The film is representative of what has happened wherever people from England throughout history have gone around the globe and thought the indigenous humans weren't maximizing it's use and had less technologically advanced weapons. I live in America and the same thing happened here to the American Indians,(English label), almost a duplicate set of historical circumstances. The people that England sent were of less than first class citizens, indentured servants, outright criminals in both places, only Australia was used initially as a PENAL COLONY for some of the worst dregs that England had at home. They eventually turned those dregs loose on the Aborigines in an eradication program with promises of a livelihood and property. This was the seed humans that England populated Australia with so I can see all of the sorry things that occurred since then being in line with America's sorry history. I have read comments from the Australian and England inputs and they vary greatly but the lack of knowledge in the actual English and Australian history is remarkable. Where did the half caste children come from? Again as in the history of the Caucasian male he wants to have access to all females while going as far as murder to restrict access to what he considers his own females. Take all of this and the movie still cannot reach the levels of all that has been done to people on this planet in the name of progress. This film has merely touched on the inhumanity of people on this planet. All films could be better but to keep it as factual as possible sometimes leave something to be desired in the embellishments.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I hardly have any words to describe this piece of art.I fell in love from the very first time i have watched it.The story is very amazing and satisfying and the animation art is so beautiful.The characters are very well chosen for this type of story.The film gives an introduction to the people and especially the young generation that the only beings that do harm and evil to anyone, even to themselves were the people and teaches us to be more kind to others and to respect the surrounding around us world that for me was quite enlightening to today's harsh world. Hardly recommend this to people who are dragon fans and not only.All i can say is great job Dream Works. Once again you bring happiness to the people around the world with your wonderful movies.My personal score 10/10 ! Can't wait for the next movie ! <3""This is one of my all-time favourites! Everyone who has eyes absolutely has to watch it. It would be a shame if you don't; it is a must watch. Studio Ghibli outdid themselves yet again. The art style, the dialogue, the movie, the story, and everything else is gorgeous. It is as if you're living the story with the characters - you can feel, and breathe the story. Even if you are not a fan of anime or anything of the sort, I highly recommend this movie. It is beautiful. I usually have a few points here and there that I would like to change about the book that I am reading or the movie that I am watching, but with Spirited Away, I have absolutely no complaint. I am in love with it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A disillusioned Confederate army deserter returns to Mississippi and leads a militia of fellow deserters, runaway slaves, and women in an uprising against the corrupt local Confederate government. Free State of Jones stars Matthew McConaughey, Mahershala Ali, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Keri Russell and i found it a very moving story based on real life events and this is a film that some people will like it and some won't but in my opinion it was a great film and the performances were great, there isn't a lot of action or war going on but when it does it's freaking amazing especially that scene that was also in the trailer my only flaw with this movie was that was kinda slow at first but you know what you're getting into and wanting more action or something else might not make this a film for you but people who like McConaughey in general and this kind of movies based on true life events and slavery will not be disappointed.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** You live only for me I stick medals into your face You are entirely devoted to me You love me because I don't love you
You bleed for my salvation A little cut and you're turned on The body already completely disfigured It doesn't matter, whatever pleases is allowed
I hurt you I'm not sorry It's good for you Hear how it screams
With you I have the choice of torment Barbed wire in the urethral tract Throw your flesh in salt and pus At first you die, but then you live more
Bites, kicks, hard blows Needles, pliers, a blunt saw What you wish, I don't say no And insert rodents into you
I hurt you I'm not sorry It's good for you Hear how it screams
You are the ship, I'm the captain Where should this journey go? I see your face in the mirror""This is an incredible movie for I believe it's a romantic comedy with a deep, poignant message that is purposely intended primarily for men. I've watched this movie two times now and both times it has made me cry. Both times it's made me focus on what's most valuable in life.
The point I feel the writer and director wanted to make here is about our precious relationships, particularly between father and son, and the importance and temporal nature of time. Time, like our lives, is a vapor that will quickly disappear. Enjoy each day like it's our last. Make life enjoyable for others in your life. Great humor. Sublime, subtle acting, particularly from Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson (carefully watch the subtle nuances in their faces throughout every scene). Richard Curtis is one of the finest British writers and directors of the modern era, always managing to capture and fuse love, emotion, and humor.
I am super critical of movies and I'm very hard to please where films are concerned, but this movie is one of the best I have ever seen and moved me in a way I have never been moved before with a movie. Great acting, extremely well written, funny, poignant, and an excellent cast. It's extraordinary the way this movie was written to elicit such emotion from the viewer, especially men. Be prepared to change the way you view your relationship with your father, and the precious, transient nature of time.""This is the type of movie that has a lot of great one-liners. For example, ""there are two types of people in this world, those with loaded guns and those that dig. You dig"". This movie is full of lines like that, and when there are no lines there are intense staring scenes and close ups of people's eyes. Can't go wrong with a close up of those squinty Client Eastwood eyes!
It is the movie that spearheaded Eastwood's career! Magnificent shot scenes! Amazing soundtrack! A must see movie! I've been watching this movie since I was kid, when I did not even understand English, it was just as enjoyable. Eastwood almost died during the filming of this movie. Did I reach the minimum requirement of 10 lines to submit the review? jeez.""The Holocaust has been one of the most awful and tragic event of the History of humanity. It will always remain a stain in our legacy, a true proof of how despicable and monstrous we, the human race, can be.
That's the main reason why the Schindler's List should be praised. It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.
So I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud. If through it, they could help prevent that such horrible tragedies like the Holocaust happen again and save multiple lives in the process, it's definitely worthier than any Oscar or Golden Globe on your shelves! So thank you Steven, Liam, Ralph, Ben and everyone who made this movie a reality. Let your message be spread and shared from generations to generations. So we could never forget and say never again!""I would say this is a perfect package to deliver a real entertainment. It has drama,emotion,thrill,horror everything , which makes it a real gem. Hollywood should learn from this. I have watched various Hollywood zombie flicks and every movie has the same thing, people are running and zombies are behind them. But this movie gave it a completely new thought and it tells how zombie movie can be made in an awesome way. Everyone in the movie has acted well, specially that little girl.There are few scenes that will make you laugh. So it has comedy too. In past few days, i have watched few Korean movies that changed my thinking about Hollywood. There are other cinemas that can make movies better than the Hollywood.""I saw this first on a VHS in the early 90s. Revisited recently on a DVD. I own the dvds of the original n the remake. Its directed and written by Wes Craven, produced by Sean S. Cunningham. Two big names in horror fraternity. This is a film in which we get to watch a trio of men and a woman abuse two young girls for fun which is shocking and awful. Its about unendurable pain and suffering meted out to two innocent girls by pitiless human monsters. A wave of nausea fell over me as I watched the young girls being brutally raped and savagely murdered. It's one of the most realistic depictions of true sadism and has proved to be one of the most shocking scenes in cinematic history. The film is a harrowing ordeal that isn't about suspense, thrill or adventure. Its about agony n revenge. Revenge in a non stylized manner. I prefer the revenge killings from the remake.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In this beautiful recreation of the events that occurred in the Jones County,MS, we see Newton Knight;poor farmer stuck in the civil between the union and the confederacy as a medic.

This Pixar movie is great. I think it's way better than Toy Story as it's about good food and it shows that mastering the art of cooking is a hard and painful path.
I find the protagonist way more adorable than Mickey Mouse. All characters are portrayed very well and you can read the expressions and feelings from their faces. The animations are very fluid.
The story itself is very heartwarming and teaches a valuable lesson for young and old: You have to be persistent and disciplined to follow your dream and to not give up half way.""There are so many elements to this incredible film that I could go through, but they have been pointed out over and over. Suffice it to say that it has an intense, dangerous element, with forces at work that are utterly overwhelming. It has a couple love stories that transcend the ordinary (not just romantic love but that which holds us up as human). We have characters that are so complex and who reveal themselves to us in ways we seldom see. The plot is complex and engaging. It could be divided into fourths, with each part a single plot line which then comes back to center. There are no cheap, superfluous elements here. At the time, it was controversial and there was talk that it was simply pushing shock value. Put the commentary aside and be ready for the ride.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Though some people prefer 1979's 'Manhattan', 'Annie Hall' is generally regarded as the one of the best in Woody Allen's pretty solid filmmaking career. Worthy of the many Academy Awards, they won. This romantic-comedy was amazing, even if writer/director/actor Woody Allen kinda hates it. It's a classic that still relevant even today. Made during an era, where Allen was transforming from making silly, yet funny broad slapstick comedies to dramatic mature material that are somewhat good, but boring films, influenced by European art cinema. The film was indeed made at the right time. Full of priceless, witty and quotable one-liners, clever break the fourth wall jokes, beautiful cinematography, charming music, outstanding animation, wonderful complex supporting characters played by up and coming actors and actresses like Jeff Goldblum, Carol Kane, Sigourney Weaver, Christopher Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Shelley Duvall, and fun cameos like philosopher, Marshall McLuhan & singer, Paul Simon made this great. I like how this movie, not only tells the fictional love story of a fixated New York comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) with a ditzy, aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton); but give us, insight on the then-relationship between writer/director Woody Allen and his co-star, Diane Keaton and why the relationship didn't work. Several references in the film mirror Allen's own life, such as using Diane Keaton's original last name for Annie, and having his character, be a Jewish comedian living in New York has made most film critics believe profoundly that this film is just another of Allen's deep autobiographical. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions, saying, the film is so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people that it was loosely based on. Regardless on his beliefs, the film is truly self-reflexive. It's hard to denial that Annie Hall does capitalized on many of the ingredients that had been the content of his earlier films, the subjects of cultural stereotypes, romantic angst, drugs, death, his use of therapy and analysis for comic effect, and his obsessive love of New York & his dislike of Los Angeles. Added to that, is his introspective neuroses and pessimism, his requisite jokes and psychosexual frustration about sex, numerous put-downs of his own appearance and personality, and distorted memories of his childhood. And Allen's script keeps going with scenes of stylistic strategies and cinematic techniques that support the fragmented nature of the film, such as the direct addresses to the camera style with voice over commentary, the adult time-travel back to childhood sequence & the sudden production of a real-life character. Added the double-exposed action, and the subtitled that contradict the action, and you got yourself, a very long, but unique film. Honestly, if Woody Allen didn't have editor, Ralph Rosenblum, this film could had gone forever. That seems to be a common problem with most of Allen's films. It just doesn't know how to pace itself. Many shots for this film, had to be eliminated or severely shorted, just to allow the audience enough time to digest it all. As much as I like the backstory of Alvy. In truth, I really came to see Annie Hall. Even Allen admit that he went overboard, saying he would had cut a lot of opening scenes about Alvy in order to introduce Keaton's character, faster. Diane Keaton really does shines in this role. She really does deserve the Best Actress win that year. An understated and subtle performance. I like how great, she was able to show character development, showing that Anne Hall does have confidence and that she can stand on her ownright. It's like a Pygmalion-like story. Just look at the scene where she sing 'Seem like Old Times'. Plus, the way, Keaton's idea to choose to dress Hall with mismatched of conglomeration of men's dress clothes was very influence to fashion. Absolutely gorgeous. Don't get me wrong, while, Allen's persona of playing characters with an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish is a bit tiresome old shtick, there was nothing too annoying about his shrill and nasal character here. I just like Keaton's performance, better. I also just glad, the film didn't kept the original murder mystery. It would feel, out of place from the rest of the story. Allen would indeed, later directed murder mysteries to satisfy that need with 1992's 'Shadows and Fog' and 1993's 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' retooled and taken from this script. Another thing, I'm glad, this movie didn't kept, was the titled, 'Anhedonia'. It truly could had been a state of acute melancholia. 'Annie Hall' makes more sense than any of the alternative titles, they were thinking like 'A Roller Coaster Named Desire', 'Me and My Goy' & 'It had to be Jew'. Overall: While, some critics might hate the movie for having a first world conflict and being a bit self-centered. With only a few flaws, this movie will continue to remind a classic romantic comedy for most, and I have to agree. It's one of the best film ever made. Definitely worth watching. La Dee, La Dah.""Saw it on a long flight, had never even heard of this movie before despite us watching anime and cartoon regularly. What happened there WB?? So I ended up seeing it more by coincidence - the same as many other adults on the 5 hour flight. And the plane was full of laughter. One of the most absurd and hilarious movies I've seen in a long time. It is very fast paced, lots of word play and verbal humor, slightly evil in touching all kinds of topics from career-nuts adults, over-ambition and sacrificing it all, bullying, casual nastiness to people. Delivered by a fast-talking, bright, very cheeky teen girl with a big heart and a stork trying to keep up and sorting it all into his very structure perspective on life. Go watch it!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If u r cinema lover then this one is for you ! Hrithik never fails to impress with his hard-work his dedication in acting .

With memorable characters, an adventurous narrative, a beautiful score and breathtaking visuals all combine to a wonderful animation masterpiece.
The film boasts an illustrious voice cast of England's top talents particularly in the late Sir John Hurt as Hazel, the troupe's self-appointed leader, the late Richard Briers as Hazel's psychic brother, Fiver, Harry Andrews as the evil General Woundwort and in a final performance that leaves an impact is legendary comedian Zero Mostel as the sour, snarky and helpful gull Kehaar.
John Hurt's Hazel is clever, soft=-spoken, at times naive but a strong leader who earns his status as the group's Chief (the head of a rabbit warren in the novel's universe). Brier's Fiver is timid, cautious, smart (thanks in small part to his psychic abilities) and loyal to his brother and the group. Andrews' Woundwort is a vicious and terrifying villain who will rip any insubordinate member of his Efrafa warren to shreds if they defy him. And Zero Mostel as Kehaar is funny as his character spouts lines with an accent that sounds like vaguely Germanic, but laced with hilarity.
The narrative structure is faithful to the source material as it follows the characters' struggles to find their home to their battle with the Efrafans. The story never loses its resonance even after nearly 40 years as the impact is still felt and the story is continuously shared by all generations.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Impressive acting by Daniel Day-Lewis and by the rest of the cast. The film is touching and engaging without any lack in terms of accuracy. The story is strong without any useless or boring exposure and the narration is flawless. Original score is very good.
The story is a tragedy of errors for a ""antihero"" the main character, Gerry. He is not an ideal and perfect citizen. He is into ""free life style"" hippie. But out of bad luck he becomes the relief valve for the British police desperate to find some one guilty for a bombing homicide. It is impressive that the film and such a sad story is based on a true story and this makes it even stronger.
I believe movies like this one should be shown in schools as a major pillar for history programs as this kind of events and stories inevitably make the student connect with the theme and automatically trigger the desire to understand the historical time
A true masterpiece.""This is a watchable movie, expletive filled and rustic as the characters demand. Movie takes some time to build but gathers pace as it goes on. The end was a bit underwhelming for me. Shahid Kapoor is brilliant as Tommy Singh. What a performance. Alia Bhatt overacts her way through the role while Daljit and Kareena put in solid authentic performances. Having seen Kareena in a number of movies - you can see how she has matured as an actor with subtle touches which were missing in her earlier days. Hopefully she continues to take meaningful roles to keep growing as an actor. The music is brilliant with great use of rap and multiple electronic sounds blended with Punjabi""One of my favorite movies of all time. I was in high school when this movie came out and it became a cult classic at our school. We even started our own mock fight clubs to be ""like Tyler"". Every few years I return to this classic, partly because of nostalgia but also because watch time I watch it, I see new things. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both amazing actors and probably my favorite roles for both of them. The screenplay is A+, filled with suspense and cliffhangers. I love how the writers portrayed the dark undertone of the movie with a sense of humor and lightness. Lastly, as an insomniac myself (due to too much coffee/work these days) I can totally relate to the duality presented in this movie and how lack of sleep can sometimes make you feel like you are someone else!""I know little about the book, but I loved this film. It was uncomfortable, awkward and dark. I was doubting all the characters right up until the end. I even paused the movie halfway through and wondered if I should continue watching because empathizing with Rachel's despair and confusion was just all too painful. I am so glad I continued watching. The final scenes masterfully piece together and the layers unearth so much more than expected. I even watched the final scenes twice just so I get some closure. Just like a good book I was sad the film had ended. Emily Blunt's performance is outstanding. She deserves an Oscar for this one.""The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman is, in my opinion the best superhero movie of all time.Heath Ledger delivered one of the most intense performance as the Joker. The movie is a flawless masterpiece that will remain in the hearts of fans for years to come and may even become a classic and inspiration for future movies. (But I hope Zack Snyder does not ruin it.) It even has one of the best super-villain movie Quote: s: ""Why so serious?"" The movie runs a bit long at some times but that is overshadowed by great performances,an inspired story, great take on the Joker. Overall it's a rare gem that's surely everybody is going to enjoy.""This is the second collaboration between Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg that involves a real life event. This time it covers the highly publicized BP oil spill in 2010 that led to massive costs to the local economy and vast environmental damages. Berg is a master at covering regular men and women who the best at their job and the bravery they display in the face of danger. This movie is another ace in Berg's filmography with a detailed account of the disaster with strong characters and solid action.
Good: The main aspect that makes this movie are the characters and the amount of time dedicated to them. The first half of the film is all about the characters on this rig going about on their day and showcasing their talents which is interesting. The cast helps these moments work thanks to solid turns from Wahlberg, Russell, Gina Rodriguez, and a slew of character actors. Even the intended villains of the story who are the BP company men led by John Malkovich are not cartoony. The action when it starts is tense and frightening with a touch of claustrophobia. The effects are great and it all moved at a good pace with a sense of location to not make it confusing.
Bad: Kate Hudson doesn't get much to do in the wife role although she isn't terrible. Of course, as is with any movie based on a real event, there is no surprise as to what happens especially if you are one who followed the story from the start.
Overall, Berg definitely tells the story with respect to the people involved while delivering the action that we expect from the movies. Entertaining, informative, good performances, and great action makes this one of the best disaster movies in recent years.""Every field of study needs its limelight in Hollywood, and this time it's linguistics. This film, directed by a French-Canadian, composed by an Icelander, and based on a Hugo award winning novella by Ted Chiang (a Chinese-American) depicts the complicated and geopolitically unstable circumstances that would arise if extra-terrestrial lifeforms suddenly appeared on our planet. At least, that's what it seems like on the surface. Underneath the typical Hollywood plot is a story with gripping philosophical and linguistic inquiries into the nature of reality. We find ourselves fascinated with each new discovery uncovered by the protagonist, an inquisitive linguist played by Amy Adams, as she begins to grasp the new Alien language. Included in her realizations are an unearthly way of perceiving time and a paradoxical new perspective on the issue of determinism vs. free will.
Amazingly, the film never goes into annoying explication, despite the highly technical nature of the setting and the complexity of the plot line. The film always gives a strong taste without revealing too much. To some this might be annoying and confusing, to others (like myself) it might spur a relentless curiosity. After the film had ended I found an online copy of the book from which it's based. I would highly recommend others do the same. Though the visuals, effects, and cinematography of the film are enchanting, and overall it is masterfully made, the philosophical themes are far more engrossing in the novella. Ted Chiang has an incredible aptitude for conveying mind- blowing scientific, linguistic, and philosophical wonders in a few short sentences. Not to mention, the story of Louise's relation to her daughter is far more personalized as we get to see things from her mind's eye.
The difference between the book and the film is seen most clearly in the titles. In ""The Story of your Life,"" the alien encounter is only a back drop to the story of Louise's daughter. Whereas, in ""Arrival,"" global turmoil and creepy alien encounters play front-and-center.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Me rooting for Dangal has nothing to do with being the no.1 Aamir khan fan :P. I do eagerly await his movies. He always has the most unique scripts, his acting is seriously perfect to the core, he makes me laugh, cry, angry This guy is a genius and lucky son of a gun when it comes making movies. Dangal is another gem added to his treasury of hit films.
Dangal shines through in every way you cannot even think of. Dangal has all the perfect masala without the annoyance of stupid bollywood songs. I love bollywood music don't get me wrong, but not when its adds nothing to the scenes or the film in whole. Dangal has songs which progress a scene and that worked well with me.
Aamir is such a genius for a reason. He wowed public by making his transformation videos viral. We all thought, he would have many scenes as the fit Aamir khan. But what impresses me is that he went through all that trouble of putting on weight and then losing it through sheer hard work for just one measly scene. Yes, he only has about 5-10 mins of scenes as the Fit and younger Mahavir Phogat.
Yes there are flaws in this film, no film is perfect but that didn't stop me from giving Dangal a 10\10. Guys i suggest you all Indians or non Indians to watch Dangal for its absolute awsomeness."Indian Cinema has witnessed a number of revenge action dramas over the years I believe the best film in this genre last seen was Amitabh Bachchan's Double Role in Aakhri Rasta(1986) but there is only one film in this genre where the revenge taking protagonist being blind was Late Sanjeev Kumar in QATL(1986).Hrithik is no Sanjeev Kumar but he played the role brilliantly.What I felt the film lacked was pace in the screenplay.Yami Gautam was good in her role and had chemistry on screen with Hrithik.Sanjay Gupta who is known for making taut thrillers was in his element after a long time and his Direction was balanced.Initially I thought QATL(1986) was the inspiration behind Kaabil but I believe Blind Fury was the inspiration here.I just hope the Indian Film Makers at least try to bring in fresh Ideas and stories but Kaabil was a good film which brought out the best of Hrithik."With the sequel coming out very soon I knew I had to watch trainspotting and this is a truly fantastic unique film. The premise of the film sees a guy try to get clean from drugs which is proved hard due to his addiction and his bad influence friends. This was the film that truly put Ewan McGregor on the map as he is truly amazing in this film, he gives some truly memorable monologues that will stick with you as the film goes on and after it as well. He has the best character development in this film and he is the guy we root for even though he does some questionable things in this film. Robert Carlyle plastic begdbie in this film and he is really fun to watch as he clearly shows his anger problems in pretty funny if not disturbing ways. The characters of spud and sick boy aren't given loads of time to develop but they are fun to watch and the chemistry between all the characters is really good and easy to watch. The story has a good journey of McGregor's character as he develops throughout the film as you see his character progression. However,there are some pointless story arcs in this film such as McGregor's romance that ends up not being resolved and comes across as a bit of a waste of time. The script is absolutely fantastic with some brilliant dialogue and character interactions that make these characters really interesting and fun to watch. The style of this film is very unique and a bit bizarre at times but it works for this film. The style has a really low budget but it works as Danny Boyle uses Evey trick he has to make this film as memorable as possible. Overall this is a fantastic film that does make me excited for the sequel.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** 1) The T-virus was originally co-created by Doctors Ashford and Marcus to help each of their sick daughters. Angela Ashford having been born with invalid legs. And Alicia Marcus with a hyper-accelerated aging process.
2) The Red Queen was patterned after Alicia; not Angela.
3) Albert Wesker killed Marcus, on Dr. Isaacs' order, to intimidate Ashford.
4) Alice's amnesia about her past was not just a lasting side-effect of the Red Queen's nerve gas entering the Hive's mansion entrance way back in the first film.
5) Wesker betrayed everybody at the post-Apocalyptic White House. Especially Alice, who was only half re-empowered! Thereby being the only other survivor of the so-called ""Last Stand.""
6) Ada Wong, Luther West, Jill Valentine, and Little Becky (Chambers?) are supposedly all dead. But, Claire Redfield survived the assault and scuttling of the Arcadia well enough to make it back to the ruins of Raccoon City. So, any and/or all of them could return in the next sequel.*
7) When and if they do, then I'll change the nine points to a perfect ten. Not before. Still, I liked it enough that I might go see it a second time. Provided I can't get in to see a first viewing of A DOG'S PURPOSE!
*It may be subtitled ""The Final Chapter."" But, that's also what the third sequel to the original Friday THE 13TH was called, back in 1984. And the latter was still followed by seven more sequels plus a remake (1985-2009)!""It is one of the finest movie done by SRK, How much more can be expected from an actor . I am really astonished by seeing his acting. what an intense look, dialogues, songs and editing. Nothing can be underestimated. If there is anyone who can take risk of doing this kind of role, it is SRK only. If clash would not have happened, it could have definitely emerged as Bollywood's highest grosser of all times. Even after mixed reviews this movie is rocking at box office and giving tough competition to its co release. But sometimes I think why every time clash happens with SRK only, why his performance is not evenly appreciated by every critic, are they having envy with his stardom or just expect much from him as compared to another actors.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Do you think the racism is all gone? Zootopia shows the answer of this question? Zootopia is a movie about an animal-city, Zootopia.(zoo + utopia) This city looks like a peaceful, democratic city, but in reality, it's not. The high-class animals ignore low-class animals.
(I will not spoil the whole story) One of the main character's' name is Judy (a bunny). Judy has wanted to be a police officer since when she witness that some predators(foxes, wolves...etc) were bullying Preys(sheep, rabbits...etc). Understandably, everybody around her said, "" You are too weak and small for be a police officer,"" but Judy graduated the police college as the first place student. I was very impressed about Judy's story ,because this shows the racism. Everybody said that she can't make it, but actually she could do it. The other main character's name is Nick (a fox). Nick is a thief. He didn't want to be a thief, but his environment made him as a thief. Nick hates preys. When he was young, he wanted to join in a boy's group, but the members were preys. They kicked Nick out of the group, because he is a predator. This shows the racism too. Nick was not trying to do hurt them, but the members kicked him out.
If I could rate this movie, I would give 5 stars.(5 out of 5) I didn't expect Zootopia to show the racism. I thought it was just a kid's movie, but it showed many social issues in these days. Personally, I love this movie. All characters are so cute, and adorable. Many people love Judy and Nick, so they are shipping Judy and Nick. At first, the director said they are just friend, but later he said ""friendship could be changed to love"". And the most popular character is Raymond S. Persi(a sloth). This sloth is VERY, VERY slow. But at the end of the movie, he got caught by Judy as a speed driver.""It absolutely sickens me for grown adults to rate this movie solely based off what they think. It's an animated movie geared forwards kids, and mine absolutely love it. It's a musical which you would expect since Justin Timeberlake and Annna Kendrick are the 2 leads. Every now and then, a somewhat sexual innuendo will pop up but honestly it took me a few times to watch it in order to catch them. While I may be sick of, simply because my 3 year old refuses to watch anything else, it's actually a cute little movie and keeps the kids entertained. I recommend parents show this their children and just hope they don't get as addicted to it as mine have.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. You fell bad for the guys and wish wars never happen. It is hard to find a movie done this well. Even if the viewer does not like war type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. It takes great courage to go alone, without any weapon to defend yourself, moving through enemy lines to save your friends and even not friends, some other guys that are wounded, even the enemy. 75 people! wow! I'm really glad he got this movie because he really deserved it for what it did, and I hope he lived a great life because he is the reason why someone should believe in humanity, and hope such things as ww1 and ww2, and all other wars across the globe don't happen anymore.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Real-life events have often proved to be fertile ground for filmmakers. Even when events are apparently well documented, such as NASA and the American space program, they have made for fine pieces of film- making as they can sometimes find the little known stories and illuminate them. Hidden Figures is a prime example of this as it takes viewers back to the early 1960s as America pushed headlong into the Space Race and the role that a group of female African- American mathematicians, effectively tasked as human computers, played in that effort.
In telling this story, the film brings together a strong cast. Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, and Taraji P. Henson play the three leads of the film who find themselves facing different tasks and circumstances as they work at NASA's Langley Research Center. Of the three it is Henson who perhaps gets the largest role of the three as Katherine Johnson, whose work becomes crucial to the success of early Mercury missions. Monáe's performance is solid as well, playing a woman struggling not just with the racial elements of the time but also institutionalized sexism as well. Yet out of the trio the best performance might come from Spencer who is an effective scene stealer throughout and does not surprise me in the least that she has received an Oscar nomination. Together, these three women (both as characters and as actresses) anchor the film solidly.
The supporting cast is solid but nowhere near as strong. Out of them, it is perhaps Kevin Costner as Space Task Group head Al Harrison (a character inspired by the real life Robert Gilruth) who stands out the best as an authoritative but sympathetic boss. Many of the performances though ranging from Jim Parsons' NASA engineer, Kirsten Dunst as the trio's immediate supervisor, Glen Powell as John Glenn , and Mahershala Ali as Jim Johnson all suffer not so much from their actual performances but from often feeling like little more than cardboard cut-outs filling out the film. Which is a shame in a way as some of them feel either superfluous or wasted in their roles with some such as Powell (who is way too young to be playing the forty year old astronaut) perhaps being mis-cast. For what they have to work with though, they do good work.
Outside of its leading trio, the film has strong production values. The film does an excellent job of taking the viewer back to the early part of the 1960s, a time of both optimism and yet still rooted firmly in the past. This is something the filmmakers work to their advantage with the costumes and sets especially feeling straight out of the period. The film makes strong use of archival footage over CGI effects to bring the actual missions to life though the mixture of the two together is well done so that it takes being familiar with the actual footage to spot the difference. The music score, despite coming from three quite different composers, suits the film well ranging from simple but highly effective orchestral pieces from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch to songs by Pharrell Williams. Combined with the direction of Theodore Melfi, the film becomes a strong mix of elements that take the viewer into the period while also telling an engaging story.
None of which would be possible without the script. Melfi and co- writer Allison Schroeder are to be commended on taking a tale that takes in the early history of NASA, the math of space flight, the burgeoning Civil Rights movement, plus life in the 1960s south to create a script that not only is informative but engaging as well. They do so by injecting a good deal of humor into the film and I have to admit to being surprised by the amount of times I laughed over the course of the two hour running time but also tension. It says something that I heard sharp intakes of breath during the climatic sequence involving Glenn's mission as the film manages to make a tense sequence despite the audience presumably knowing that the astronaut lived into old age before passing away recently.
Yet the script, and the film itself truth be told, does tend to delve into unsubtle melodrama that undermines it at times. There are scenes that, even sitting in the cinema, feel entirely invented such as confrontation involving Katherine Johnson and her white colleagues and a scene that immediately follows it. The film is also guilty of some historical and technical errors as well from a newscaster's line of dialogue about the Mercury capsule ""achieving an altitude of 116 miles per hour"" to the lack of figures such as NASA rocket engineer Wernher Von Braun or condensing NASA's facilities down to the point that less knowledgeable viewers might think that Mercury mission control was in Virginia (it was really down in Florida). It is something that perhaps undermines the film somewhat though not to a fatal extent.
On the whole though, I can forgive the writers and the film for its occasional lack of subtlety and over-simplifications. Hidden Figures tells a little known story into a highly engaging way thanks to a combination of strong lead characters, first rate production values, and a script that takes what could have been a heady combination of historical events and infusing it with humor and tension. It is a fine example of what a historical drama can do: illuminate the past for a new generation and inspiring them.""Definitely a 9 of 10. I only saw minimal reviews of this film, and was surprised with its quality. It was very enjoyable, and I'm not even an action fan. The only reason I don't give this a 10, was because Afleck doesn't quite cut it, in this role. Nonetheless, it was a good enough performance. I don't think too many actors out there in the right age range, could have pulled off this rather difficult role anyway. The acting was otherwise of the highest quality. The story was extremely well crafted. Calling attention to a medical condition, is the icing on the cake. It is somewhat convoluted, but comes together rather nicely. It even puts in some believable pathos as well. I highly recommend it for fans of good suspense, acting, as well as action.""Dangal (2016): I waited for this film since I watched its trailer.I have waited a lot for its release date but unfortunately this movie didn't got released in our home town.So,I lost hopes of watching this in theater and waited for its Blu-ray version.But surprisingly Dangal showed up in our local theater today.So the moment I saw the poster,I rushed to the theater to watch this already declared classic.SO how is it?
Plot: Mahavir Singh Phogatv(Aamir Khan) is a former wrestling champion had to quit the sport due to his family pressure as it was not helping his family financially.He only dreams that his son should win Gold Medal for India in wrestling but back to back he has four daughter's.Mahavir feels his dream cant be complete and starts staying away from the sport,while his daughter Geeta (Zaira Wasim and Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar and Sanya Malhotra) are growing the notices that they have quality of being wrestlers and starts training them,Geeta and Babita have to get a hard training and start to dislike their father for this but they realize that their father is doing this for their betterment and take the sport seriously.Geeta soon becomes a a known wrestler in the state and wins Nationals too.But fate starts going in wrong direction when Geeta goes far away from her father's training
Plus Points:
1)Performances: Once again,an award winning performance from Mr.Perfectionist Aamir Khan.His dedication and passion towards acting is visible in each and every scene.His transformation for the role of Mahavir is commendable.The two girls are played by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who win us over with innocence and exasperation before showing us how expertly they move.Fatima ass grown Geeta did a wonderful job.Her hard work is seen everywhere where she mimics the true wrestling techniques with perfection.Sakshi Tanwar, who plays the hapless mother, trying to strike a balance between an unyielding father and daughters who just want to be girls a little longer is brilliant in her role.
2)Wrestling choreography: This is the major break through for this movie and definitely helped a lot to achieve a special place in sports based films.In Dangal,the wrestling choreography is excellent and strikingly credible.All the wrestling matches are nail biting because of its realistic making.Kudos to the film makers for bringing a true sports feel.
3)Screenplay and Direction: Screenplay of Dangal is high on emotions and an aspiring father's goals.There are lot of remarkable scenes in Dangal where audience will get emotional.Especially the scene where Geeta wrestles with Mahavir is one of the best moments in cinema.Even the use of National Anthem at the climax is a brilliant taking.Nitesh Tiwari successfully delivered one of the best sports drama to Indian Cinema.He should be applauded for bringing us the tale of unknown heroes who achieved fame for India,.
4)Music: Pritam's music is solid and his background score is brilliant.Dangal title track definitely gives goosebumps every time it plays in the movie.
5)Cinematography: Sethu Sriram's textured cinematography oscillates between the poetic -- there is a lovely slow-motion shot of dirt from a shaking head flying across a red sky -- and the powerfully prosaic, with the wrestling scenes looking startlingly real.
Minus Points: None except that like all sports dramas this one is also highly predictable.But predictability never matters when there is enough inspiring content,
My rating 9/10""Its premise might be straightforward (two siblings resorting to bank robbery to save the ranch, and the restless Texas Ranger in pursuit) but ""Hell or High Water"" doesn't feel conventional. To some extent, this reminded me of ""Heat"" - not in the fates of certain characters, but just the dance between lawman and bandit - and the pivotal heist that can so badly reverse one's fortunes. But you basically know what you're in for with this, and can expect great performances from the three leads *(although the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and his partner was unexpected and quite pleasant).
But since I've brought up ""Heat"", this was much more low-key and for me, it's the dialogue that really sets this movie apart. Long stretches of sun-blasted Texas scenery, enlivened by the occasional punchy one-liner. And in case that sounds boring, this certainly isn't. But for a movie about gunning up and robbing banks, there's more fun to be had when the guns are holstered. Top to bottom, this is a great movie.
8/10""Just as the movie starts and progress you will feel the real love, affection within you. The emotions are captured superbly and I loved the first off much. Second part how the society take advantage on them (blind people), you will be filled with agony on witnessing that and look for a 'good person' to help them, but there is no one to help them. Murders are planned and executed well. Full set combo. Loved a lot. Hero and heroine acting is fantastic and mind blowing ... you will see the real love and affection on screen and feel the same. When ever they both appear its full of happiness, joy and love is filled. I would say a great love story is pictured.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Spoilers Ahead
Split is in my humble opinion, his best work since Signs. To start off with, the performances by the leads were excellent. James McAvoy blew it out of the park with probably one of the best performances of his career. The way he was able to get into every one of his 24 personalities was mind blowing. How he is Hedwig at one moment then Dennis another created some really tense moments. Anya Taylor-Joy was also brilliant, giving a really emotional performance. She sold the fact that she was afraid but yet knowledgeable on how to handle such instances. (Her messed up uncle made that so). The other two actresses were all right but had their moments of over-acting but that didn't get in the way of enjoying this movie. Shyamalan is back as a director creating some scenes with genuine terror and suspense. My personal favourite was missed by many. In his meetings with his Dr. Karen Fletcher, I was on the edge of my seat, as I was waiting for Dennis to snap when she pressed. The music, while not James Newton-Howard level, was still very good.
Now, as I have gone through some of the reviews for this film, I got disheartened by some of the reviewers. So, while I don't believe my arguments will change anyone's mind, I'll write them so you may understand my side better. The most frequented complaint I hear is that it did not represent DID well, and I'd agree, but I'll ask why did you go into this movie expecting credible science? There are half men/half beasts in this movie, true science isn't the goal. Instead, Shyamalan uses it as a starting point so that the audience isn't completely in the dark of Kevin's condition. This is done all the time in movies from Rain Man to Silver Linings Playbook, all done with varying degrees of authenticity. That's just how Hollywood works.
The next most popular critique is the ending. I reiterate, this is a spoiler filled review. So, according to the last scenes in the movie, this universe takes place in the same universe as Unbreakable. I've heard people describe it as a stupid gimmick and terrible twist, but I don't think it's that at all. Sure, if you've never seen the movie Unbreakable before, you'll be perplexed at the endings significance, and that is my biggest problem with the film. A stand alone film should not rely on another film in order to get it's full significance, but my next point somewhat excuses this, and that's why I still love this film. According to Shyamalan, he had plans to to do a trilogy with Unbreakable, and we see this in Unbreakable. When Mr. Glass speaks to David Dunn near the end of the film, he tells him there are two types of villains. The soldier villain and the brain. Mr. Glass was obviously the brain part, but we never got to see the soldier villain. I'm not mad at the ending because it was apart of Shymalan's plan all along. So this is in a way, a sequel.
There are more complaints that could be addressed, but I tried to keep this to the point. As I said before, I know I probably won't change anyone's mind, but I wanted you to see,and understand, why one fan loved the movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** DEADPOOL!!!! This film is amazing, why you ask because of Ryan Renolds! Not only was his performance true to the character but he was involved every step of the way to make this film. After X-Men The Wolverine Origins put a crappy Deadpool on screen we are lucky enough to have seen this. Now talking about the film. This film uses non-linear story-telling, Narriation, 4th wall breaking, a montage and lots of great action and comedy. Deadpool can do anything and the creators of the film took this to the next level, just look at all the marketing. For a film that had a 60 Million budget, it was incredible. Deadpool is not just a superhero movie but also a romance, comedy, and tragedy if you will. Deadpool is true to the comics which makes this movie great. Theirs a lot of great comedy from Ryan Renolds and TJ Miller and great action. Overall I give this film a 9.5/10 for being amazing. If you're wondering why no 10/10 it's because I found some of the scenes where they make fun of their X-Men films or the Studio a little head hitting. Deadpool one of my favorite of 2016 and looking forward to CABLE.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** As a lot of people have pointed out, the plot to Hell Or High Water isn't totally original: the plot is that two brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, are robbing banks to pay off the reverse mortgage on their family home. It's not original at all, but it does take several original turns:
-As opposed to just focusing on the Howards, with Tanner portrayed by Ben Foster and Toby as Chris Pine, we also follow a pair of Texas Rangers who are pursuing them, Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham)
-The pacing and plotting is different: there's two bank robberies in the pre-credits sequence, then there's planning on the Howard's part and investigation by the Rangers, then the big shootout scene, then a quiet 8 minute dialogue between two of the characters. A normal Western, or even any other thriller would be building and building as it went on.
-There isn't any 'villains' in the traditional sense; in a modern take (the last 10 years), the banks are seen as the villains.
The other thing that does separate this and prior Westerns/Neo-Westerns is the sheer quality of work. Taylor Sheridan, who produced an excellent screenplay with 'Sicario' ups his game even further, with his dialogues in particular shining. There's an excellent scene where the half-Indian half-Mexican Alberto talks about how all the land that ""these people grandparents took from my grandparents is being taken from them, but not by any army"", which sums up a lot of the film, and gives Birmingham a real chance to shine. There's another with Tanner and Toby talking about their upbringing, which says a lot about how Tanner and Toby differ because of that part of their lives.
The characters themselves are excellently altered versions of prior characters. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as Marcus Hamilton - arguably the best of the film - as he gives this old Ranger a real fire and fight, but also a humour that is natural to Jeff Bridges. Chris Pine, who has always been a good actor stuck in the Captain Kirk box, plays the desperate family man forced to crime to save his family, who's quiet but also very valiant - he's doing this for unselfish reasons. And then there's Ben Foster, who plays by far the biggest twist on the convention: Tanner Howard is a violent rogue, who is very much a live wire and fully ready to commit all kinds of acts throughout the movie, but is doing these particular robberies for his little brother's welfare, and Ben Foster channels both sides to the character with equal virtuosity, making a 2D stereotype into a guy to both fear and root for.
David Mackenzie and Giles Nuttgens team up awesomely together as Director and Cinematographer. Both of them use very constant long takes specifically to wring every ounce of tension out of certain scenes - a classic example is Tanner's dialogue with an Indian where he says they are both ""Comanche's"", and the camera lingers long enough to get the tension to max, or the ending in which you tense as if something's about to happen. They also focus on the Mise-en-scene well enough to show the world and have an audience invest in it, even when there's no soundtrack or incidental music to enforce it.
I can put it in words - I love this film. For me, it's flawless and will only get better with more viewings. If you like Westerns, you adore this, and if you're OK with them (like me), you'll love this too hopefully.""A small single dialogue in Stars war movie 4 ""The Phantom Menace"" is a whole movie. Only those who have watched the star war movie series can truly understand the value of this movie. This movie is well balanced in many aspects. Even if someone who is new to star wars watches this movie, it will be intriguing to watch all the other ones. The action sequence, the story momentum is brisk till the very end. The way in which everyone and everything was connected was fantastic to watch. The chain of events the shown to achieve a success is a team play. All this was expertly interlinked and connected to sew the wonderful masterpiece. I gave it an 8 as it was close to perfection. I recommend this to ones who wanted to view very different kind of Star wars movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Sing is a 2016 animated musical comedy that features Matthew McConaghey,Reese Witherspoon,Scarlett Johansson,John C Reily and Seth McFarlane and tells the tale of a washed up business koala named Buster Moon(McConaghey)who holds auditions for a singing competition worth 100,000 dollars in order to keep his theatre up and running. So he gets a working housewife pig(Witherspoon),a gorilla who's father is on the run(Taron Egerton from Eddie The Eagle),a punk rocker porcupine(Scarlett Johansson)a mouse with a sly persona sporting a Frank Sinatra vibe(Seth McFarlane)and a shy elephant who dreams of singing(YouTube Sensation Tori Kelly).
Together these animals help impress Buster Moon to win the is prize.But does Buster really have the 100,000 dollars or is he bluffing about it?
Overall I found this film to be a feel good animated film. The animation is very good,the voice acting is very good(although I thought the Koala was going to be Hugh Jackman since Koala's are from Down Under but never mind),the story to its credit has been done before but overall myself and my mom saw this in 2D yesterday and we both enjoyed it.
Thumbs up""This film IS all over the place, but even if you are just a film buff with no interest in Kung Fu films, this is worth a watch. With tons of references and homages to other movies, from Fred and Ginger to Bruce Lee, and from The Shining to The Matrix, it's kind of fun just to look for them.
It has both comedy and serious elements, but you have to look fast for them, because this movie is fairly relentless with the action. This has a huge budget for a Chinese Kung Fu film too, and you can see right where it goes because there is CGI mayhem aplenty. And that leads to the only group of filmgoers who will not enjoy Kung Fu Hustle at all; those who do not like action films.
This is not a real talky film, and seems to let the action do most of the talking for it. You might not like it, but it never gives you much of a chance to get bored.""I find this movie incredible good. And the funny part is, I can't even tell exactly why. But it draws me back, again and again. I watched it 4 times now, which is not something I do normally.
First, the story is believable, at least, for me it is. Where the common story of King Arthur is a mythic story, this one could be for real. I can actually imagine, being there, in that time and place and see it happening.
Second, I like the people, all of them. They are also for real. They are not all good and not all bad. And even the bad ones are not all bad. This is such a good cast for this movie.
As said, the story draws me in, in a way that I actually would like to be part of it.""Well yeah i have just watched it and all i can say is good movie according to average of other Turkish movies.I will not say it is undoubtedly perfect but it is a good movie.For all of us there must be some reasons to watch movies.It changes from person to person but for this movie you all should go and watch the movie. Why ? Because Turkish army really needs to see that all world is behind them .They are fighting with terrorists. We lost many of our soldiers. And this movie was supported by Turkish General Staff.Let just go and support their fight morally. They are the protector of all of us.One die,one thousand rises.""The Big Short was not a film I loved the first time I watched it. The characters were on the surface unlikable, the content was not particularly thrilling and the directorial and editing choices in this movie were somewhat unconventional. But upon a second and third viewing, I realized that quite simply, this thing is a masterpiece. The actors involved all put in superb performances, thought I am not as keen on Steve Carell's role as others may be. Gosling, Bale, Pitt, and a slew of lesser known names bring their A game. The director, Adam Mckay, is able to make finance, banking and intricacies of Wall Street scamming not just accessible but damn interesting. The movie moves at a brisk pace, with lots of flashy cameos, sharp inter cuts and snippets of financial education delivered in memorable and clever ways. When you realize that the story revolves around a recent chapter in American history that many are still somewhat ignorant to, the film is elevated to greatness. Highly recommended and strong replay value.""This movie really brings home the devastation bigotry brings down on us all. It not only ruins the lives of the targeted, it destroys the perpetrators. The performances in the film are top-notch and the sequence of events is relatively easy to follow. The film is well worth having to read subtitles. Having watched Bruno Ganz as Hitler, it's impossible for me to imagine anyone else playing the part. The testimony of one of the inhabitants of the bunker is particularly effective, especially since she does not excuse herself but, in fact, accuses herself. Assuming we will be lucky enough to still have public schools in the future, this film should be required viewing in every US high school.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This all-star American western of the 1980s appears to be quite divisive on the site, but I thought it was great fun. It does have something of a TV movie atmosphere to it - you just know that it's never going to be too violent or too dark, but rather quite family-friendly - but the plot is good enough to keep you interested and the cast is excellent. Director Lawrence Kasdan injects plenty of life into the proceedings and despite the lengthy running time I was never less than intrigued by the story.
The early parts of the film introduce the main characters in their own sub-plots. Hard-man Scott Glenn attempts to look after his precocious younger brother, played by Kevin Costner in a very youthful, slightly annoying turn. Danny Glover is a brooding hero type, coming home to his family after years away. Kevin Kline, best known for a career in comedy, is surprisingly efficient as the expert gunslinger. Others, like Brion James and Rosanna Arquette, don't really have much to do, although Linda Hunt is very good in her smaller part. John Cleese is miscast but thankfully not around too long.
The story comes and goes and even during the middle part, where the action scenes are in short supply, I was entertained. Brian Dennehy's larger than life sheriff character helps a lot and seems like he's been imported from FIRST BLOOD. The latter part of the film and climax play out exactly as you'd expect, but the action is well shot and exciting, and the cinematography makes this a gorgeous-looking experience. Overall, I found very little to dislike about it, and in actuality I loved it.""If you are considering to watch this film and are in doubt the read this review. You should know that i am 16 years old and love action packed films whit a solid budget. however this film is not only about the action, they have done their best at putting some emotions in it, and i think it went good. Don't get me wrong its not a masterpiece like saving private Ryan. but works as great entertainment with a little extra...
Brad who pretty much dominate the film does a good role. Despite his age the man is in great shape, and deliver a good performance. That sad thing is that he is almost a parody of himself and reminds me a lot about Aldo from inglorious bastards. Ofcorce not close to the same quality. But that is not expected either.
But anyway see this film, its not the best but works so good anyway. I like how the film follows a dark, hardcore plot line. Mud, blood, bullets anything a 16 year old want to see with his friends on a Friday after a boring week at school. I had a good time despite week plot and not the greatest dialogue. I can see that more grown up and intelligence people don't find this very fascinating. But if you ask me (our some of my friends) its was great and delivered 100%
Sorry for bad English I'm from Norway.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The best things about this movie were 1) the unpredictability, and 2) the way that AI was defined. The great acting was a bonus. This movie really made me think. I feel that the majority of human beings wouldn't have been able to successfully escape that situation that Ava did because of our ability to manipulate others is highly affected by our emotions. Alex garland took artificial intelligence to a level that made so much sense to me.... if a robot (emphasis on robot) has the same brain capacity (aka programming) as homo sapiens, their ability to reason and think logically would be programmed and refined... as opposed to humans, which are influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, and other physiological parameters that shape our though processes (p.s. I believe these qualities actually make us much more intelligent than artificial intelligence could ever be). Our brains are a combination of genetics and our environment - which is shaped by our experiences and memories. If they made Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would be way far into the future p.s., the ability for them to retain memories and these memories to influence their behavior would be a major factor into being able to classify them as AI. Although they would feel emotions, they would be able to make decisions and act in a way that isn't as influenced by the emotions they feel, unlike humans. AI must have the ability to feel emotion and pain, but the way that this shapes their thought process vs humans.. so interesting. At the end of the day, we are far from developing artificial intelligence that could overpower homo sapiens, solely because they are essentially technology (inorganic and engineered), which gives us a lot of control over them. This is the first movie on AI that I enjoyed thoroughly""If you are unwilling to accept the basic premise of the film, that a child who has surgery on a broken arm is suddenly able to throw a pitch over 100 miles per hour, you aren't going to like this movie. I've been a baseball fan for 60 years and I know when a baseball movie is going to present an accurate portrayal of the game. If you read anything about this film and you are a purist, there are probably another ten movie to pick from this day. That said, this is a delightful film with a joyfulness that brings back memories of what it was like to be a mediocre baseball player, still hoping to be a major leaguer someday. The boy in this film is klutzy, so his entrance into a major league game is filled with fear and worry. There are good guys and bad guys, especially the father candidate. At some point, we know that reality will set in and, like ""Damn Yankees,"" someone is going to have to face a real situation. This is just charming and fun. Enjoy it. It was never meant to be a documentary.""""Edward Scissorhands"" is a variation on the Frankenstein legend, relocated from Europe to American suburbia, or perhaps I should say to an exaggerated parody of American suburbia. It is presumably set in either Florida or Southern California, as we learn that the ocean is not far away and it is the sort of place where people can walk about in shirt sleeves even at Christmas. The set designer seems to have been given a brief to produce something straight out of Malvina Reynolds' song ""Little Boxes"". This is a community whose inhabitants do indeed live in little boxes made of ticky-tacky which (apart from colour) all look just the same, and as in the song there's a pink one and a green one and a blue one and a yellow one..
Dominating this otherwise flat and boring community is a hill crowned by an eerie Gothic mansion, the home of an elderly, eccentric inventor who, like Frankenstein, is working on an artificial human. Unfortunately, the old man dies before he can finish his creation, whom he has named Edward, leaving him with scissor blades instead of hands. (Why the inventor should have wanted to fit Edward with scissor blades in the first place is never explained, but fantasy is a film genre which enjoys a certain exemption from the laws of logic).
The film explains what happens when Edward is discovered by an Avon lady named Peg Boggs and adopted into her family. (Did Tim Burton realise that ""bog"" is British slang for lavatory?) Although Edward has no hands as we would understand the term, his scissor blades mean that he is an expert at anything involving cutting or chopping, and he is able to earn a living as a hairdresser (catering for both the local housewives and their dogs) and as a gardener, carving hedges into elaborate topiary sculptures. He also has a sideline in ice sculpture.
At first Edward is a popular figure in the neighbourhood, but then two incidents turn local opinion against him. Joyce, a middle-aged housewife, tries unsuccessfully to seduce him, and then goes about saying he tried to rape her. Edward is then arrested after Jim, the unpleasant boyfriend of Peg's daughter Kim, tricks him into taking part in a burglary. Although Edward is released, hostility eventually reaches such a point that he is forced to take refuge in his original home, the old mansion on the hill, where he is confronted by an angry mob led by Jim. (By rights Jim should be grateful to Edward, who has never revealed his part in the burglary, but he is jealous of a growing attraction between Edward and Kim).
The film begins and ends with an elderly woman telling the story of Edward to her granddaughter; at the end it is revealed that the old woman is Kim Boggs, which implies that these scenes must take place around the year 2050. Burton does not, however, give them a futuristic look; indeed, they look very traditional, emphasising the fairy-tale nature of his story.
This is one of my two favourite Tim Burton films, the other being ""Big Fish"" which also has a leading character named Edward. The two Edwards, however, are very different, as are the films in which they appear, even though both can be classed as fantasies. The Edward of ""Big Fish"" is much older, a jovial old extrovert, an adventurer and a teller of tall tales, a modern-day Baron Munchausen. ""Big Fish"" has a happy ending and is outward-looking in the sense that Edward's adventures take him all over the world. ""Edward Scissorhands"", by contrast, ends poignantly and is inward-looking, with all the action taking place in one small community.
This was probably the film which made Johnny Depp a major star, and in my view it remains one of his best performances. He made the role so much his own that it is strange to think that he was not the first choice; that was Tom Cruise, who was not available. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks both turned down the part; after seeing the completed film Oldman was to state that he regretted his decision. Depp's Edward, unlike his namesake in ""Big Fish"", is a shy, withdrawn young man, socially awkward and introverted. (His unkempt hair and pallid complexion suggest an affinity with the Goth movement). For all his awkwardness, however, he is good-hearted and capable of love, something which Kim instinctively recognises. (Jim has never loved anyone or anything except himself). The other notable performances come from Dianne Wiest as the kindly Peg and Vincent Price, in his last feature film appearance, as the inventor, who is seen in flashback. Depp's real-life girlfriend Winona Ryder as Kim makes a sweet heroine, although someone should have told Burton that the lovely Winona looks a lot better as a brunette than she does as a reddish blonde.
""Edward Scissorhands"" deals with a number of interrelated themes- self-discovery, the search for personal identity, social conformism, disability, the nature of artistic creativity and the problems of those who are perceived as ""different"" by society, but fortunately Burton and his co-scriptwriter Caroline Thompson deal with these weighty themes in a relatively light, poetic manner and not in a heavy-handed or preachy one. There is also a fine musical score from Danny Elfman. This is one of those films you can discover more in every time you see it. 9/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** *Could be a spoiler or two* My ONLY problem with the whole movie was James Woods! Nobody, I mean NOBODY ... goes around flaunting laws and rules and treating every single person he comes into contact with, like garbage. Another thing ... Eric Roberts' character is insanely jealous, to the point that he sees Stallones character looking into his car, he immediately jumps out and threatens Stallone with all types of bodily injury, (even pulling a knife on Stallone in wide open public), yet, a li'l bit later, in his mansion, he walks into a room where Woods has just slapped the ""ca-ca"" out of Stone's character (meaning, she would obviously have a hand print on her face, or a bruise, or black-eye, or SOMETHING), and Roberts does or says absolutely nothing! But, back to Woods. He treats the bomb crew like rookie desk clerks, and no one says anything or calls him on it. He even makes a li'l ""pen-bomb"", and activates it in the bomb squad room, daring the bomb squad leader to deactivate it it in less than 10 seconds ... and he gets away with it (yeah, right)! But, other than Woods, this is actually a good, entertaining movie. Plenty of action, lots of explosions, even a very uncomfortable-looking shower sex scene! This is a movie where just about everyone that you want to see blown up, gets blown up!""This is one of the best films i hv ever seen. Amazing acting skills and amazing story line. A definite mention abt the direction which is just fabulous . The film is going to create a lot of confusion throughout but after the ending, its seriously going to blow your mind.. U r going to think about it for weeks.. Must recommended film.. If you are a fan of sci fic and thriller, this film is just for you. This film should gt an Oscar. I have ranked 9 out of 10, Which is pretty high, cuz normally I dnt give this high rank to any film. PREDESTINATION is a must watch film...You are going to end up loving this film. And even if you dnt love sci fic genre, then also you r going to like it. Thrilling, entertaining and beautiful film. This is definitely one of my favorite's.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Masterminds is a great movie! I really don't understand all the hate toward this fine film. This movie is funny! Every actor shines and does their best and deliver great performances. I think the director did a great job with his vision of the film and the look of the movie was beautiful. Masterminds was a well done movie and deserves to be watched. Please watch this movie and do not listen to the negative people, they will just keep on hating. I am very proud to own something from this great film too! I shall treasure it always. Please give Masterminds a chance you will be glad you did. This movie is vey entertaining!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Very powerful beginning as we're thrust in the first moments of a nuclear attack from---we don't know. Frantic terror was achieved.
Then we're immediately in the horror of it all juxtaposed with no immediate physical threat. I say that because they're not being chased down by a monster or serial killer. But there is the deadly radiation outside the locked door.
There was a problem in that it should have been a slow boil inside these walls between the people who have survived but had their lives taken from them. But it wasn't.
Someone somewhere probably said there must be some sort of external threat. A gun battle.
Quckly some sort of bad guys with hazmat suits show up and kidnap a little girl. They're fully prepared and equipped mere hours after the attack. But who are these guys and what is their purpose?
A decent fight with those bad guys, although the others take the girl.
But never mind that the previous scene had the whole building above them falling down all over them. The bad guys had managed to somehow create a flat surface between the doorway and their ""lab"". As the opening established, there was a short hallway to the door from a winding stairwell. They would have needed a substantial amount of earth moving equipment for several hours to achieve anything close to this.
Okay, so we find out that they're doing experiments of some sort but we forever drop that ball because they want to weld our heroes into their prison. Why wasn't the bad guys guarding that doorway, being that they just lost several soldiers?
But just based on pure b-movie adventure, there were worse ways to waste 20 minutes.
So we're back to the slow boil, which was better than average. Mom goes nuts for losing daughter. Guy goes nuts from cutting up body (which was effective but probably not necessary).
As they start to starve, we find out that the Super is hiding supplies. One of our initial heroes quickly devolves and tortures the Super, thus becoming the head honcho. After this, we glide for awhile in debauchery with no real fluctuation.
Then suddenly the only other woman has enough and stages a coup, which leads to the effective and tragic conflict. I was a bit surprised at her selfishness. But I did see where she needed the suit and that one of the other two would have taken it from her.
The problem I had was the potential that was lost. There was not enough character development. This was suppose to be a conflict with these characters. The only real change was from Milo Ventimiglia's character, but cursory. Lauren German was supposedly our hero, but was a general overview with no real movement. They did create some compelling characters, but to no real extent.""I liked this comic take on a true life crime story about a bank heist. There is quite a collection of comic talent here and they are given a chance to shine as various types of white trash.
Zach has been quite annoying in some previous movies but here he is the star and he is good. Kristin is good too and prettier than usual. Owen Wilson is always welcome. Jason is fairly funny too.
The good part of this comedy is it doesn't rely on excessive crudeness than plagues recent comedies in order to be funny. The story itself is funny and there are quite a few unexpected laugh out loud moments as the action goes from NC to Mexico.
Worth a watch.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One of Guillermo Del Torro's most divisive movies as it was mostly reviled by critics and audiences. However the movie is better than most people are willing to give it credit for. The story of a wealthy woman who marries a mysterious and charming stranger, but butts heads with her new sister-in-law and soon discovers haunting secrets about her new home with deadly consequences in store.
The film is well cast with Mia Wasikowska as heroine Edith Cushing, the naive and lovely heiress who aspires to be a successful novelist in late nineteenth century America (and London once she moves to her husband's ancestral home). Edith is prone to being haunted by ghosts as she regularly sees her mother's spectral form warning her of the titular ""Crimson Peak"".
Playing the role of Edith's suitor is the devilishly charming Tom Hiddleston as Sir Thomas Sharpe. The English actor is perfectly suited for the role as he exudes charm and tenderness while harboring sinister secrets that attract us even more to Hiddleston's Thomas.
And rounding out the big name leads is Jessica Chastain as Hiddleston's sinister sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe. Chastain plays her character with an out-right disdain for Wasikowska's Edith which leads us to mistrust her immediately. To counter her sinister nature, Chastain demonstrates an eerie control on Hiddleston's Thomas. Her motives for her behavior are kept secret from the viewer until the film's shocking climax when Edith finds out the horrible secrets of the Sharpes.
The film keeps an utterly unsettling atmosphere as Del Torro utilizes soft color palettes for lighting and the sets. However the red clay is a garish shade of red to offset the green tones of the titular house. Admittedly the CGI in the film is cheap-looking compared to Del Torro's other films where he blended practical and digital effects much more seamlessly.
Still give this film a chance even if you end up hating it."Imagine that your entire family was wiped out killed one by one and all that is left in your life is a puppy and someone kills the puppy well that is the story of our friend John here he will stop at nothing to figure out who killed his best friend the dog this movie is a lot of fun to the core action and suspense packed with thrills I highly recommend seeing the movie if you have a strong appitite for a action packed fun thrill ride kinda movie or if you are looking for a good time i suggest that you watch it yes the violence in the movie is strong and brutal at times but it is still a winner watch it you will not be disappointed that you did"*** This review may contain spoilers *** Early on we find Mohan addressing the press in NASA about cities his initiative would have an impact on. He goes about, "" San Francisco, Latin Mexico, New Delhi..."" , dispassionately. Delhi doesn't resonate ethnic familiarity. It's another piece of geography. A mere statistic. He's as Indian as a Mira Nair movie. The very mention of India in a press conference- after returning from a trip there - towards the film's closure, unsettles him. It's no mere ""another"" country anymore. It's his; he its. It's the pin that made contact with his carefully cultivated American bubble. Swades is book-ended by these two press conferences. It's the story of a man's search for his mother, that ends in his motherland. It traces an individual's metamorphosis from being a condescending first world citizen to someone crushed by the stench of third world reality, which was easier to digest as editorial observations over English breakfast.
Where do I start? Do I talk about the audacity of the role reversal employed, where the leading lady is chivalrously let to tie dhoti to an almost emasculated hero; who's regarded as a deity of fluffy romance in the country's heartlands. Or do I talk about the spectacle, simple thoughts are translated into on screen like the ""Yeh Tara, Woh Tara"" song sequence. Just a few nimble limb movements here, a few facial sparkles there. A song with stars as metaphors under a night sky sprinkled with glittering stars, rendered by a nimbus star in an ominous form. It's as transcendental as poetry gets on the big screen.
Neither the obscene budgets nor the more obscene promotions(hawking) of these days were there to flex, but he was nonchalantly wearing his superstardom like a good perfume. His charm was organic, not labored. If Khan's the film's face and heart, Rahman's music is the pulse and soul. Rarely do we get a musical score that follows the story like a solicitous shadow, never once intending to precede or side step for attention. It grows with the protagonist; melting with him; simmering with him; hoping with him and hurting with him. It fashions the western finesse to the eastern sensibilities of the film's milieu. Swades is a fine example of what happens in a legitimate marriage between the song and dance trope and narrative dexterity.
And a special mention, actually a very special mention to Gayatri Joshi. The deadpan way in which she competes with SRK's calculator, her implosive consent to his boisterous overtures, her outbursts of child ego while being possessive of Kaveriamma or the dollops of grace she adds to the chiffon saris. She brings so much dignity to Geeta, doing more to the role than it does to her. Not often do we get an actress who makes us feel guilty in a wet dream.
Mohan's starting to scratch beyond the surface of paper patriotism, when Kaveriamma sends him to collect rent arrears from a farmer. To him it's just an expedition, another rustic journey to a rudimentary hamlet . But she knows more. She knows it would make him go off the deep end on a journey of self discovery. On his way there he travels on a boat, standing with a glint of amusement in his eyes, distant from the other modest passengers. He doesn't disrespect them. He just doesn't belong.
He meets the farmer, through him meets with every ugly truth inundating a nation- poverty, casteism, apathy - he only knew of at an ethnicity and number-of-rivers basis till now.He came to India with first world problems like guilt from not being able to stay in touch with his foster mother. His project in NASA addressing the issue of global water scarcity that hitherto swelled his chest slowly fades away to in-prominence as he gazes skywards, from the ground reality of a third world peasant's backyard. A young boy sprinting helter skelter, to sell water for 25 paise adds further salt to his wounded soul. On his way back, he returns a different man on the same boat. He's humbled by the guilt of ignorance about a country he claimed to be a part of; humbled by the knowledge that the ""humble"" lives led in its heartlands was in fact euphemism to the collective sufferings. Legs folded, he's seated among the other modest beings on the boat. The distance between them had crumbled. In fact it now feels like a crime. ""They"" becomes ""we"", as he becomes Indian.""I have always loved this movie---and all M Night movies---because I like that they are suspenseful, but not gory and bloody. Our 2 ten year olds and thirteen year old watched this for family movie night---and they were on the edge of their seats loving it. It made them think and guess at what was happening, without being overly violent. They were really intrigued about the idea of it being a bedtime story and were very interested to find out if it was a real story or not.
I feel like all of his movies have such a great message just below the sruface---and this one was about faith, healing, and love. It reminded me of Signs at the end--it has a hopeful feel to it.""Spoilers Ahead:
Young people will never believe this, but the studio was very worried about this movie. It was a sneak preview which is always the sign of a troubled movie. Word, in the movie magazines, was that the studio was worried about the chemistry between Gibson and Glover. The most intense of the series, featuring the most disturbed Martin Riggs. This is way before the series became as much comedy as it was action. As the movie opens, Riggs is celebrating Christmas, in his trailer, putting a gun in his mouth, weeping over his dead wife. It is one intense scene, with Christmas music in the background. Riggs and Murtogh chase down the case of a friend of Roger's, whose daughter did a swan dive off of a high rise all coked up. They soon discover that the coke she had, in her system, was poisoned. Somebody wanted her dead, if she hadn't jumped, she would have died anyway. As the case unfolds, the two very different men are put together. Trust me, it is not all hearts and flowers at first. They absolutely hate each other, Roger thinks Riggs is full of crap, trying to draw a psycho pension. One of the best scenes is where he hands Riggs a gun and dares him to kill himself. It doesn't go exactly according to Roger's hypothesis. The movie's charm is that the two men, though it takes the whole movie, build the beginning of the series' great friendship.
They begin to discover some nasty mercenaries, headed by this creep of a general and his muscle man Mr. Joshua, played well by Busey. Joshua has this imperviousness to pain which he demonstrates by a lighter under his hand. Gibson's Riggs is a crack sniper, from Vietnam, his skills come in handy near the end of the movie. Parents, be warned, there is some graphic torture using water and electricity and also neck snapping. If you have only seen the sequels, you will be surprised at how intense Donner made this original. Donner tries to lighten the intensity with some moments of levity usually dealing with how crazy Riggs is and how he doesn't give a S about dying. Watch for the jumper who just got the wrong cop to sympathize with him. Truly, I don't think Riggs has a future as a social worker. Donner cleverly introduces Roger's family which befriends Martin and draws him slowly into their group. Realistically, for the first half, these two cannot stand each other.
The movie grows increasingly serious as the mercenaries decided to kidnap Roger's daughter. This is really still an action movie, so I turn off my philosopher's brain. The action is from the first frame to the last one. There are just a few short breaks between some excellent action set pieces. Busey gives one of his best performances, the movie climaxes with a martial arts showdown between Riggs and Joshua. I consider it the best predicated upon: the amount of action, zero boredom and a much more intense and unpredictable Martin Riggs. Lethal Weapon 2 has plenty of intensity, also, but on the whole, it is a lighter movie until near the end. Riggs has fun with Roger like when he tells him that the 38 snub is an 'old guys gun.' I love in the shooting contest where Martin shoots a happy face with his 45. The best action movie Richard Donner ever made, I got the feeling the studio was stunned at this incredible success that spawned all those sequels. The acting, of the two gifted leads, is why this worked so well. A Great Action Classic. Q.E.D.""There are lots of books about kids who don't fit in. There are lots of books about bullying. The movie industry has created scripts, utilizing these personalities and showing their struggles. This movie rises above the ordinary. It's a fantasy film that is also a love story. What is real? What is in the mind? It doesn't matter because love and friendship supersede a setting that some would say is impossible. The boy and girl create a world where they can get away from unfulfilled lives and revel in a kind of medieval ethos. They face monsters and trolls and other forces, but that is what gives them life. As they make their respective ways through Terabithia, outside factors begin to resolve themselves and an embracing of the the real world happens. Watch this with your kid.""Reviewed April 2012
Not many movies can be branded clichéd, stereotypical, predictable and at the same time excellent and interesting. This movie is just that, of course some excellent acting and likable characters did help too. I always admire a maker's clarity on what they want to present, even if there are some glitches in execution, but this movie has none.
Skeeter (Emma Stone) an aspiring author during the wake of Civil Rights movement, wants to write a book on the African-American maids point-of-view on their masters. The times are dark and for a black person to come forth and talk is also a crime in the State of Mississippi. After a few refusals, Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) comes forth to talk and share her views. After a few more incidents, another maid Minny (Octavia Spencer) joins. Soon there are plenty of maids who want to share their stories after an injustice after another mounts on them. Skeeter has a neutral point-of-view and is determined to complete what she started, no matter what sacrifices she has to make.
As I had mentioned earlier, this plot is completely cliché driven and the characters and sequences align themselves to present a viewer friendly closure to every incident present. But this whole mess is wrapped in such a nicely packed presentation, though it crossed the corner of my mind while watching, I could point them out only when I think of the scenes when writing the review. So in a way the movie has succeeded it's objective of holding the viewers attention and entertaining them too and the portrayal of those stereotypical characters to be likable is another peak to mount, which this ensemble cast does with ease. A special mention should go to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer as the maids in focus, they are the ones that produce and control the emotional aspect of the movie. There she is, Jessica Chastain again featuring in the immediate movie I have watched, she does her reputation no harm here also displaying another dimension to her acting. She resembles a lot of Julia Roberts to me in both looks and acting wise.
All the negative things you might have heard about this movie are probably true. But what triumphs is the excellent presentation and it should be a case study for that aspect, to hide all the limitations and plot holes at least until its runtime. A definite watch.""I'm going to keep this short & sweet. I really do not understand the abundance of negativity that this film received. Everybody has opinions & of course even some of the most treasured films have their naysayers but come on!! This movie doesn't have much wrong with it at all, in fact it nails most of it's necessary components & the comedy really works. There we're a few areas that didn't nail it for me but that is really picking at it. I am even surprised to be saying this but I honestly feel that it's a better film than the original Ghostbusters. If your hell bent on hanging onto it's predecessor so much so that you've made a decision before you've even watched it then this film wasn't for you in the 1st place! If you aren't sure about this one just watch it because it's definitely one of the recent comedies worth your time.""When I heard that a prequel to Monsters -one of my favorite animation movies ever- was coming to the screens, I frowned. I thought it was a matter of milking the cow for commercial purposes. I was wrong.
Monsters University is a great prequel and a great animated movie. The script develops the characters in ways that make sense if you have watched the first movie, as one comes to understand why these characters become best pals despite being so different. If you haven't watched the first movie, this movie is still good on its own.
I really like this movie, almost as much as the first, but for different reasons. Monsters Inc was very emotive, tender, very charming, very magical, unique, and as much for kids as for adults. Monsters University is obviously an expansion on the first, and reminds me of traditional American sophomore naughty movies (minus the sex) and the Revenge of the Nerds, films that I usually enjoy and find funny; so it is more for adults and less for children. If you don't like sophomore movies, well, MU might disappoint you.
Overall, the film is very funny and entertaining, and the animation is wonderfully creative, with a great use of color and textures, great backgrounds, and lovely well-developed characters.
The dubbing is great. Crystal, Goodman Buccemi, Mirren and the rest of the cast infuse their characters with life and one forgets that they are the ones speaking, something that not always happen in animation when well-known actors do the voicing and they aren't there, in the soul of the character.""Ghost in the Shell (1995) is one of the best manga to anime movie transfers of all time and director Mamoru Oshii had great material to work with from the original artist, Masamune Shirow.
It is Shirow who came up with a rather complex, but accessible and rewarding story about the emergence of AI in a future world of extreme interconnection and cyborgization. GitS deals with what it means to be human when your very conscience can be uploaded or high-jacked, and your body is 100% machine except for your brain. To that end, it takes a cue from eastern philosophy and the result is probably the deepest meditation on the subject ever put to film.
However, the movie is much more than that. The world building is phenomenal and Oshii takes his time to present the city through the use of a few exquisite silent sequences that only use music. There are also strong action scenes to satisfy anyone who likes mecha.
Obviously, the anime cannot address all the various themes and subjects of the manga, but it gets the main points right and it does the most it can. It is a creative transfer that does the material justice and together with the fantastic eerie music by Kenji Kawai, it constitutes a solid 10/10 rating from me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If I had to describe this movie with one word, it would've been tremendous. I was eating a sandwich at the beginning of the movie but as it progressed I got so engaged that I forgot to eat it. Get ready for an action packed thriller. We've all watched Hollywood zombie movies but this movie just takes it to another level. I myself am not specifically a fan of Korean movies myself but this movie is worth watching. The pacing of the movie was a bit slow in the beginning but as the movie progressed it went from zero to hero real quick. As you watch the movie you bond with different types of characters which in my opinion, all of them represent a specific person in society. Eg. the businessman represents the guy who works a lot, gains a lot of money and thinks he is above all. The husband of the pregnant women; the guy who is always a bit humorous and would sacrifice himself for the sake of others. The father is also the person who works his butt off but is always a bit selfish. But as always he/she realises what he/she has done and regrets his choices in his past. Towards the end of the movie everybody probably smirked at the death of COO of the train company. But also, when the father tried saving his daughter and the pregnant women, he got bit. As the girl started crying ""father don't leave me"", I admit I cried too.I would watch it again although I know the plot.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Surprisingly good movie. Has a lot more heart than I was expecting. This is coming from someone who doesn't watch hockey.
Just a nice story handled very well, not re-inventing the wheel but it'll get you rooting for it and give you a great feeling.
Sean William Scott was very memorable and likable as this unintelligent but honest and loyal meat-head hockey player. He and Allison Pill had great chemistry. Jay Baruchel did a good job as well on the type of obnoxious bad-boy character that is easy to make really annoying. I guess that's good directing.
I've been watching a lot of movies recently and it's surprising to note that you really don't see virtues portrayed that well in characters nowadays. And I'm not sure but I think that's one of the things that's so nice about the main character here and just feels unexpectedly refreshing.
The rivalry between the main character and Liev Schreiber was also very fun (not trying to get too deep here but when enemies have a mutual respect and admiration and sense of honor it always adds a nice element, and it makes a difference even in something dumb like a hockey fight--when Schrieber smiled at the end, even though he had lost the fight, it makes all the difference than if it had been handled as normal hateful enemies).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I thought it was a great movie but as for a horror movie, it wasn't. It was an inspirational movie because she over came the problem, recovered from her injuring, finished med school and reconnected and got closer to her family. I would say it would have been a horror movie if there at the end she almost killed the shark but instead got eaten. I told people about this and they asked if anyone died and yes there were some that died but they were idiots. The drunkard deserved because of the theft and the other two were just unaware of their surroundings. I am a big believer of everyone being armed so she should have had a Glock 20 (10mm) with her and could have eliminated the problem right away and saved her self a lot of pain.""This highly suspenseful film is full of ghosts, magic, and murder. It is great entertainment as you the viewer try to figure out whether the film is about magic and illusion or revenge and murder. The story takes place in the last 1800's in Vienna during the reign of the Hapsburgs. In fact, Crown Prince Rudolf is a primary player in the story. Rufus Sewell, who has played every European king in one film or another, does a super job of play Rudolf. But the primary story is about a young village boy who becomes fascinated with magic and a young aristocratic girl. Ed Norton plays the adult magician, Eisenheim, now grown up and returning to seek the girl he has never forgotten. His magical skills have increased exponentially and they are the tool by which he makes his living, and by which he courts his long lost love, and by which the film's mysteries are finally resolved.
The characters are masterfully portrayed by the cast and help carry the viewer along as they experience the situations generated by the fascinating story of an individual who rises to the top of his profession as an illusionist but is in love with that unobtainable women who is the object of all he desires. This movie is powerful and effective and carries the viewer along on a ride that offers fantasy mystery with adventure and romance thrown in as extras. The settings and ambiance leave little to be desired and establish an aura of romantic intrigue that compliments the outstanding acting on the part of the entire cast. The background music and surround sound never overpower the dialogue and the overall balance produces a highly effective movie that leaves the viewer wanting more.
Overall rating: 9 out of 10.""THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is a great war drama based on the conflict and ideals. Parodic moments are visible in a fictional story. Nevertheless, I think that this story, which is based on the novel of the same name, is very interesting and sincere. In the second part of the film, the story takes on the characteristics of an adventure thriller.
A large contingent of British prisoners arrives in a Japanese camp. The prisoners have to build a bridge on a river. Two colonels collide and one prisoner manages to escape from the camp. Failing to break the resistance, and facing a fact that the bridge will not be built in a given period, Japanese colonel accepts a proposal of a British colonel (prisoner) that he and his soldiers build the bridge. One of the protagonists considers that bridge must be built perfectly in order to remain an example of the skills and knowledge of British soldiers. However, a special unit was tasked to bring down the newly built bridge...
Conflicts are extremely tense and uncertain in this film. It is difficult to draw a line between the bad guys and the good guys or the winners and losers. Dialogues have been filled with quite a dose of irony and humor. Conflict of the characters is based on discipline, obsession and professionalism. Scenery is a little masterpiece. Mr. Lean has directed a story so powerful and so wise that time in the film simply ""flying"".
Alec Guinness as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson is, to say the least, a split personality. A brave and persistent colonel is transformed into a stupid snob. His character is incredibly interesting. Under the cover of a war hero and a true leader an idiot is hiding. Mr. Guinness has given us one of the best and the most important militaristic portraits in the film.
William Holden as Commander Shears is a soldier who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is resourceful and sarcastic .... and maybe a little romantic. The only protagonist who pays attention to women in this film.
Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito is brutal, stubborn and lazy. I would say, this colonel was incapable for any kind of action and work. This is a parody. That's the point. Jack Hawkins as Major Warden is determined character, who puts war aim ahead of human life.
The last words of one of the protagonists describe this movie the best .... in this case in a positive way of course. This film is one of my favorites.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a very interesting, dark and somewhat surreal look into the Vietnam war. It's a intense and deep movie with a lot of imagery that shows the evil side of men. This was a very very difficult movie to produce and direct because of many different set backs, budget constraints and conditions. Marlon Brando's condition was one of them, because he was a difficult actor to work with. Despite his excellent portrayal of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. The plot is about Captain Benjamin L. Willard(Martin Sheen) who has his share of seeing the dark side of humanity, horror and evil getting sent off on a mission to find and track down and eliminate Kurtz for unspecified reasons. For Willard, Kurtz is someone that he secretly has somewhat of a respect for and to a certain extent understand where Kurtz is coming from. In another words Kurtz is someone that resonated with Willard. It's actually very clear where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas for the first ""Metal Gear"" video games. When it comes to a soldier who is facing his own demons and longing for war trying to track down and eliminate a legendary soldier. When it comes to this films portrayal and mentality of most soldiers during the Vietnam war, it is shown for what it was instead of glorifying it. It delves into the inner persona of the soldiers during the Vietnam war and how to some of them it was just a big game. Maybe to show how seeing so much death and carnage can numb the human conscienceness. As a matter of fact the more Willard and his group delve into the jungle the more he experiences dehumanization. And how some people may play nice to hide the evil within their hearts. This is a very ambitious, ambiguous and masterful film that really immerses the audiences into the indoctrination of evil on screen because of war.
10/10""I saw someone had described it as a masterpiece and I wouldn't disagree. I watched it with subtitles but it isn't an issue as it would work in silence in terms of understanding the story line. It begins by making you fear the worst could happen to the young girl who meets a seemingly motley group of men late at night. However it takes a different course and moves at an incredible pace It is shot in a way so that it appears to be one continuous shot from start to finish. This in itself is quite a feat. The unpredictability of the film and the tangents it shoots off at keep you on the edge of your seat. The characterizations are strong and you care what happens to them which also matters so much in any film. The story line has been covered by others I am sure and its probably best not to know too much about that aspect or you could undermine the tension created. If only there were more films of this caliber rather than Hollywood trash like La La Land, which is badly made, crafted and predictable- all characteristics not shared by this film!""In video games there are so-called mod developers, guys who take games that exist in the market and interfere in their operation, giving the games new features, merging themes and franchises, but almost always working within a prey-established functional structure. From a classic, therefore, something new can come up that ends up - or in some cases, more - appreciated as the original title.
When I think of Quentin Tarantino's cinema in Inglourious Basterds I can not help but compare him to a mod developer - and one of the good ones.
As is usual with the filmmaker's cinematography, he mixes languages, eras and schools - which virtually disappear into the result, becoming something of his own. From Sergio Leone's forests (which had already inspired Kill Bill Volume 2) come the inspiration for music (Ennio Morricone is on track!) And the tension in duels (verbal or physical). From John Ford he lends the theme of revenge, the whole ""Chapter 1"" and a framework ripped from Traces of Hate (The Searchers, 1956). The creation of the character Aldo Rayne (Brad Pitt) comes from actors like Aldo Ray (1926-1991) and John Wayne (1907-1979). From an obscure 1978 Italian war movie title of the film. Da novels vague the content of ""Chapter 3,"" with Mélanie Laurent's Shosanna reminding the characters in the Truffaut films ... the list is extensive ... and I'm sure it will triple when I watch the movie again.
Tarantino, cinematic super nerd, picks up all those things that he loves, with which he has grown, and transforms them. He has done this before many times, but in this quest a certain subtle organization separating the genres he emulates through an organization into chapters. They are almost all excellent. The problem is precisely when, superconfiant, he lets out a few pops. Usually they work in his hands, but here - it's a period film, after all - cause strangeness at one time or another. David Bowie's ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"" in WWII? Exaggeration (although the scene would give a video clip and both if isolated).
The story begins in Nazi-occupied France, where Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent) witnesses the execution of her family by the hands of Nazi colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz deserved a separate criticism). After a brilliant introduction with an intense conversation between the characters of Denis Menochet and Waltz, the girl manages to escape and flees to Paris, where she creates a new identity as a movie owner. Meanwhile, also in Europe, Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt) hell's alongside his group of Jewish soldiers the Nazis. Known by his enemies as The Bastards, Raine's squad joins the German actress and undercover agent Bridget Von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) on a mission to overthrow the leaders of the Third Reich. And the destinies converge to the cinema where Shosanna is planning its own revenge.
Intelligent, yet kept strictly simple, the plot invests in the actors - and the casting direction is the best of the career already celebrated by this characteristic of Tarantino. And if I mentioned above that Christoph Waltz deserved his own criticism, I gave him at least one paragraph. The Austrian actor gives no chance to anyone who shares the scene with him. Its villain is so sensational that Inglourious Basterds unintentionally becomes almost like a Batman movie, in which they are the antagonists that are worth the ticket. Brad Pitt? Good and caricature, as the film requires. But Waltz is simply in another sphere of talent.
Caricatures, by the way, are the movie's bread-and-butter. It's fun the way Tarantino consciously reduces characters to their known stereotypes (the rough-and-tumble American, the French blasé, the over-educated English, the star-crossed Nazis ...) to save time on explanations and character building. The only one he really cares about is Hans Landa again, and this has caused some controversy among critics. Worshiping the Nazi, even with the stunned and historically hallucinating climax that the film offers, is not something even easy to digest.
Also questionable is the eternal ""tarantino violence"". Some love, others hate. Considering the director's previous films, I found it this time contained, left for a few moments of impact. But that's why I do not mind seeing scalps and baseballs smashing heads. Tarantino's cinema has even a somewhat anesthetic property in some in relation to the sanguine. He manages to turn ""gore"" into ""cool"" within certain audiences. But the warning remains - some have criticized production harshly because of this, people who consider Tarantino an eternal adolescent fascinated with his toys. This is not the case with this criticism, but I can understand their reasons. Tarantino is even inconsequential - but as long as he has his captive audience, made up of people like him, he will continue in his little world. I at least thank you.""Just early into the New Year, I, one who saw this in its 2011 original release, and am watching it right now, on Amazon Streaming, have finally taken it upon myself to review it six years now.
To jdkraus from Mainevillo, Ohio. Just with all due respect, you're a wee bit off with your proffered 2008 release date for ""Taken"", the earlier, somewhat similar monster blockbuster, but it was one year behind, 2009 the real release date,so no harm done with the wrong date, since 2008 was before 2009.
Now onto the review. This film, with Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, and January Jones, taking time off from some TV ""Mad Men"", take the lead here.
Neeson is a spy who goes overseas with wife Jones, goes in a taxi, crashed into a navigable river, and then winds up amnesiac in the hospital. He knows of being Dr.Martin Harris (but it's not sure and I sure as heck ain't gonna spoil this here).. and then spends the first part of the flick running up against an impostor, a January Jones who does not even recognize him, a kid-nap, or adult spy-nap..to coin a phrase, where he again winds up in some hospital, a sinister following by someone through a tunnel,, then meets Diane Kruger (always lovely as ever..) who becomes the best person to happen to him, almost a girlfriend, and offers him (Neeson:)""a place to crash') This friendship is off and on as she b word slaps him at a hip disco, suspecting something, wins up with wife Jones, being more her Mad Men husbands type, and from here I ain't gonna spend any more time here, because it would spoil it.
You just gotta watch, or what ever, or hey. Read other reviewers.
Everyone, including Fox, has been ""Taken"" (a-hem!) with LIam Neesonm, and it shows with films (this is from Warners,though,not Fox) Trademark of losing or looking for someone or something is a longtime, and patented Neeson trademark, but commercially and creatively, you have to admit, it works. No big chases a lot with Fox's Taken movies but still a very good thriller.r""Watching this once more, this time on blu-ray, I am reminded just how very good a film it is. McCabe and Mrs Miller has always been my favourite Altman film but I think this might just be a little better and a little more enjoyable. Ironic, of course, to watch this on the sharper medium when so much effort went into 'flashing' the film stock so as to partially degrade it and take that ultra bright look out. Altman himself wonders whether he went too far and there are one or two spots where there might be concern particularly in the darker corners but overall he has effectively altered the look so as to make the film more timeless. Sure there are the naked yoga ladies across the way to constantly remind one this is a seventies film but Gould (in a sensationally laid back performance) seems to wander in and out of this time and place quite effortlessly. Enthralling and believable with great dialogue, this is a joy to watch.""If anyone hasn't seen ""The Big Short"" yet, it comes highly recommended. Not only just it uncover the absolutely fraudulent nature of Wall-Street, in the years prior to the Financial Crisis, but it breaks down the various financial technicalities into easily palatable and understandable metaphors.
Anyone else thinks this movie looks like it is set in the 80s and not 2005? I refuse to believe I dressed like that 10 years ago. The film stars a whole skew of Hollywood leading me to take on the shady men. most importantly, Ryan Gosling. Okay forget that part.
It really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging, but also mortifying; As Roger Ebert's website puts it: A good alternate title might be ""American Horror Story.""
The movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of the events surrounding the initial financial shock which culminated in the 2008/09 Financial Crisis and excels in mixing humour and serious candour to communicate its message.
How accurate was the subject matter of the movie? Pretty accurate really, and it is much better than reading the scathing 663 page report from the US Government on the subsequent crisis.
Surprisingly, the screenplay is almost as well-structured, informative, and entertaining an adaptation of a complex work of non-fiction as Nicholas Pileggi's and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. McKay and Randolph focus on just the right number of characters and find inventive ways to keep the movie light, funny, and easy to understand; yet their approach almost never devolves into shtick or patronizingly juvenile spoon-feeding of information. Unlike most documentaries about the causes of the global 2008 recession, The Big Short doesn't work backwards, investigating abstract causes and effects. Instead, it gives us compelling, quirky protagonists we can identify with and intertwines the minutia of the financial system into the goals, obstacles, and story arcs of these men. Though McKay and Randolph utilize several narrative devices I don't lovemultiple narrators directly addressing the camera, breaking story continuity to explain complex concepts in whimsical ways, video clip montages meant to set time and place or contextualise ideasthese are few and far between and, for the most part, they work.
Unfortunately, the same can't be said for McKay's directing style. I wish McKay, the head writer for Saturday Night Live during one of its stronger eras, had more faith in the written word, but his bloated, semi-improvised comedy features rush through as many jokes as possible, never fully allowing a whole to form from the sum of its parts. The hurried approach is even more injurious to this primarily dramatic feature. The Big Short is not a patient movie and therefore it's far less potent than J. C. Chandor's tense and secretive Margin Call (2011)still the best film made on this moment in history. And should've won an Oscar for ""best picture"" rather than just getting a nomination. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses both cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It's strong stuff.
Especially, the cast was spectacular!
I began off feeling wary about this motion picture: the haircuts and garments of the primary characters were more '90s music-video than mid 2000s, and the occasionally shading de-saturated flashbacks to a few characters' back stories were a little on the inauspiciously typical side. Be that as it may, the story force, joined with the base mind of a significant part of the exchange, and the submitted acting going ahead underneath the hairpieces, all did their employment. What's more, they got over the irate, skeptical conviction behind the motion picture, which is that the real banks all occupied with fake, criminal action, and that the U.S. government safeguarded them out to the detriment of the little person, and that there's no sign that the banks wouldn't accomplish something like precisely the same once more. You are allowed to oppose this idea. Be that as it may, this is a motion picture that utilizes both silver screen craftsmanship and evident realities to put forth its defence. It's solid stuff.
The Big Short is a blended pack that I in any case prescribe seeing. Superior to anything any account or narrative film, TV show, or radio program I've yet observed or listened, it clarifies credit default swaps, subprime home loans, collateral's obligation commitments, and other money related builds in clear, intelligible terms. It abstains from damning things down to the point of haughtiness, yet by one means or another remaining parts a somewhat unblinking standard stimulation.""This movie is purely enjoyable. Here we have a killer cast of legendary Jack Nicholson, The brilliant Leo DiCaprio, the star Matt Damon, Martin Sheen the star actor of legendary Apocalypse Now and Mark Wahlberg who surprisingly stole the show and earned an Oscar nomination. So the acting was definitely brilliant. Scorsese also did a great job directing this masterpiece making it more violent and realistic.
This is a brilliant and thrilling movie till its very end, full of suspense, violence and you will not be bored in this picture. One of the absolute finest of its genre.
Scorsese never disappoints the fans nor the critics and he definitely excelled in this movie. You have to watch this masterpiece.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When originally hearing about this film a few years ago,I for somehow mixed up for being part of the Despicable Me series! Finding Turbo and Mr. Peabody & Sherman to be delightful ""one-offs"" from Dream Works that were shown on TV during Christmas,I decided to correct my mix up,and delve into the mind of Megamind.
The plot:
Being the only baddie in the city,Megamind passes the day in fights with local superhero Metro Man.Finding Metro man to get bored of the routine,Megamind kidnaps Metro's girlfriend Roxanne Ritchie for the 5th time,and sets a new trap. Preparing for Metro to arrest him once again,Megamind and the city are left in chaos,when Megamind's latest trap appears to have finally killed Metro off! Expecting to be happy,Megamind starts getting depressed over there being no superheroes to fight with,which pushes Megamind to put his mind on creating a new superhero.
View on the film:
Bringing Ben Stiller and Guillermo del Toro in to give the title a final gloss in the last month of production, director Tom McGrath looks into a mind of endless energy,with the attention to detail shown in the wide street shots leading to the action scenes having a crunch that is a match for any live action Comic-Book flick. Making Megamind rather refined, McGrath pulls at the vibrant,pulp coloured roots of Comic-books,flying from Megamind having a deep blue, paranormal round his cape,to the stainless steel whites reflecting the funny ""perfection"" image of Metro.
Landing just before Comic-book movies took over the Summer season,the screenplay by Brent Simons & Alan Schoolcraft dives between a hilarious spoof,and a genuinely exciting anti- superhero tale in its own right. Taking sweet shots at Megamind getting what every baddie wants in a blockbuster flick,the writers hilariously dissect superhero and villains mythologies by leaving Megamind at a complete loss over what to do over finally succeeding. Soaring to life with sharp animation that give the characters a fresh appearance,the writers brilliantly match the high-flying jokes with a sweet, lonely heart being revealed behind the boo-hiss image of Megamind,as a mega light is turned on in Megamind's mind.""Guess what? It has plenty of scenes that are all about singing and dancing, it's why it's called a musical I would dare to say. So if you don't like musicals, it's quite possible that you're not gonna like this one, but if you are willing to give it a shot, please watch from the beginning to the end with respect, because if you are willing to pay attention it may offer a good moment. I like musicals..not all of them, I am not fond of every word being said while singing, but I usually tolerate and sometimes I quite like it. This movie is much more then a musical. It's a tribute to musicals, to old cinema, to acting, to jazz and yet still manages to tell a typical story in an original manner. When you think it's all about the pretty songs and scenes the movie starts punching you with some reality and then reality strikes. I found it amazing for giving me all those elements. I just read a message and it made sense for me.. I laughed, I felt like singing and dancing some times and I cried. It gave me all that in about 2h so for me that is a great movie, but I think it's not the typical story that is delivered to you, like in stories that are so strong by themselves they basically wouldn't need anything more to be worth watching or Marvel movies that have many effects so it's always an experience to watch so I can understand some people not liking it...it's not typical and if you like that then it's new, fresh and amazing!""Manages that fine line between entertaining for adults and children. Script is funny, touching, and smart. The songs, being parodies of classic Disney songs, are also quite good. The animated segments are also very well animated. The backgrounds in particular evoke the old feel of Snow White.
Most of the characters, and the people who play them, are multi-layered and likable. However, it's Amy Adams as Giselle, who's the star player. She performs the very human personification of a Disney princess.
The only minor issues with this wonderful film are an underdeveloped villain and an unnecessary poop joke.""No really, it did. I couldn't believe how nice this movie made me feel as I was watching it. The story is a pretty standard hero's journey, but with the evil trolls or grendels or whatever eating happy trolls to get happy themselves. It seemed a little dark at first, but everything works out in the end of course, as this is a kids movie. It shows good and bad in equal measure, which I believe is how we should educate kids, not keep them in a bubble. The lessons it teaches are actually nice, don't give up, persevere, happiness is within. The boy troll (Timberlake) is so funny, especially in the beginning. Anna Kendrick is hilarious with snappy dialogue. The songs are a bit old fashioned, the fact that the writer is nostalgic really stands out. But they fit the story, rather than being just music breaks, so it's good.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** At first I was only interested in this movie because of the prominence of Scott Joplin, but I soon found out that it had a lot more going for it than just the score.
Highs: Let's start off with the obvious: the soundtrack. Even if the movie was unbelievably bad the music would still be good. I mean, it's Scott Joplin! I'm not going to give Marvin (may he rest in peace) too much credit here because all he did was adapt it a little, but kudos for using Scott Joplin in the first place.
For a 1930s-style movie the script is on point. Not only is it witty but it just sounds like what would be expected of the era. Very entertaining in and of itself; the same thing could be said of the soundtrack.
We can't leave off the plot; this movie is in fact so plot-centric that it would probably be considered a failure if George Roy Hill somehow managed to not pull it off smoothly. Of course, it all works out like clockwork, and it's a fantastically entertaining series of events to watch.
The acting is impeccable. I've seen better but really it can't get that much better than this. Redford and Newman work together just as well as in their previous masterwork ""Cassidy and the Kid"", or, rather, have the audience fooled otherwise. Seems a little clichéd but remember this is a 70s movies; it's only a cliché now BECAUSE of this movie. The plot twist was in no way dated in the time period in which it was shown. I'm not going to spoil it; to do that would be an injustice to any first-time watchers.
Despite the seeming anachronism, the Sting still retains a strangely timeless quality.
Lows: Any Joplin purist (which I often will be) will oppose to the orchestral adaption of the pieces. I actually have no problem with these adaptations, they don't really feel out of place or anything. Which leads me to the next point: Joplin's music SHOULD be out of place. He was already a forgotten figure for at least 15 years when the movie took place. With that being said though, the soundtrack still fits swimmingly with the rest of the work.
It's actually incredible how well the song selection fits with the plot. If you know Joplin and can name the tunes as soon as they float from the screen (as can I) then you really have to give Marvin credit for placing them where they are. ""The Entertainer"", of course, is during the opening and the title selection; where the audience requires a little...entertainment. ""Easy Winners"" is played right after Luther and Hooker walk away loaded after a con...easy money. And Solace is, of course, played during Hooker's search for love...or solace. I can't find anything to say about the ""Pineapple Rag"", for obvious reasons (this movie doesn't mention or show fruit very much at all) but the others are pretty genius.
The only real con here is that Marvin is given a little bit too much credit. Many people will remember him as the ""composer"" of the brilliant tunes while it is in fact the one and only Scott Joplin who originated them. That is probably the only legitimate low I can find here.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have looked over a couple of the negative reviews on here and almost fell off my chair when people say the acting was bad. these people are either blind and deaf or very confused in life. This is hands down the best acting I've ever seen and has left me thinking about this movie for days. Given there is one bad actor (one of the girls) however the lead character plays several persons flawlessly. his transition from one personality into another is seamless and amazing to watch as not only his voice changes but his facial expressions and behavioral actions change along with it, each personality is unique and its as if you are watching a new actor each time. I feel the people who say this film has bad acting would also believe chitty chitty bang bang is the greatest film of all time.
Would watch this film 100 times and not get sick of the acting.""I remember watching a Star Wars documentary called Empire of Dreams which is about how the first trilogy came to life and his tremendous success which is still going on today. During one of the many interviews George Lucas gave for this doc, he remembered the huge deal of pressure he had to bear on his shoulders while filming Empire Strikes back.
He produced it with his own money he earned thanks to the huge success of the first movie as he wanted to keep his independence from the big studios. The fans had also a lot of expectations about the upcoming movie so George Lucas wanted it the same level if not better than A new hope. And it is.
While a new hope was focused on this small band of young people and their struggle to destroy a devastating weapon of mass destruction, Lucas has dedicated this movie into developing each one of the characters as well as the relationship between them with its lot of surprises. That famous scene when Luke learns the terrible truth about his father's fate is one of them and to me this is the knockout moment of Empire.
The other big novelty is this romance between Han and Leia. It's a great addition to the story line which allows us to discover another entirely hidden side of both of them. It's fun and sweet to see them teasing at each other. It adds some lightness too in a very dark plot.
We are also introduced to three main new characters who are part of the Star Wars Legacy: Yoda, The Emperor and Lando Calrisian. There's no need to introduce Yoda, the cunning and wise Jedi master, who is maybe small by this height but awesomely powerful with the Force. In the first movie, Obi-Wan introduced us to this powerful invisible superpower but Yoda is the one who tells everything about it while we follow Luke in his Jedi Training. He shows us the true meaning of the Force. This was what made this character so important to the general story. About the Emperor, even if we don't see much of him in Empire, we understand that he's the main villain of the story and that in fact Darth Vader is one of his victims.
Of course we still see a lot of epic combat scenes like the Battle of Hoth with those imperial walkers advancing towards the rebel base, the pursuit in the asteroid field or of course the duel on Bespin between Luke and Vader which climaxed with the surprising revelation of Darth Vader to his son.
All of those made this movie incredibly awesome. To me Empire Strikes back is the best episode of the entire saga and it's not surprising that so many are seeing it as the movie to compare each time a new star wars movie is released.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If there is one filmmaker who really understands movies, it is Akira Kurosawa. His films (I have only seen ""Ran"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Ikiru"" and ""Rashomon"" so far) are the epitome of complete cinema. Kurosawa, like Stanley Kubrick, has a great history of not directing bad movies out of his career. ""Rashomon"" is probably his first great masterpiece, and became an instrument for the spark of his international fame. The movie was not adored at Japan upon early release though, despite being received positively in the west. After the worldwide success of ""Rashomon"", Kurosawa began to work on other Japanese greats like ""Ikiru"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Throne of Blood"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"". To receive the honour of a preservation by 'Academy Film Archive' and became a major influence for movies internationally, ""Rashomon"" is now regarded as one of the greatest works in the canon of cinematic art.
""Rashomon"" revolves around characters The Bandit (Toshiro Mifune), The Wife (Machiko Kyō), The Samurai (Masayuki Mori) and The Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), whom later 'recall' about an accident at a forest. Although the stories from the four characters do not favourably support one another, we can at least agree that a murder and rape do happen. It is interesting that in the story, the court places its importance on the murder (victim  The Samurai) but not the rape (victim  The Wife).
According to The Bandit, The Samurai is only dead during a duel between the two men. The Wife never mentioned of a duel but keeps trying to suggest that she is docile and innocent. About what causes the death of The Samurai remains a mystery in her story. The Samurai (through a medium) talks of his wife's wicked betrayal and still, never hints about an incident involving a duel. The Samurai, according to his version, sees death through suicide. The Woodcutter's report, however, bears some resemblance to The Bandit's story but later becomes questionable when he actually attempts to conceal his crime of stealing a valuable from the scene of the murder.
This masterpiece runs at a modest runtime of 88 minutes but still manages to be not straightforward. ""Rashomon""'s story is beautifully problematic, and what so great about it is the deliberate sketchiness of it. The idea that four accounts of the similar incident are not identical concludes that either only one of them tells the truth, or all four of them lie. There is no need to find out on who is being truthful; the message that Kurosawa tried to put across is how a motivation from self-interest could easily overturn one's innocence. When ""Rashomon"" is so close with matters linked with human nature, it made it made it to be even darker than his films like ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Ran"" (I have not seen ""Throne of Blood"", ""The Hidden Fortress"", ""High and Low"" ). It quickly ranked as one of his best works by many. But darker is of course not necessarily better.
Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com""I watched this movie several times at school, in philosophy, history, geography and even art classes. Modern Times shows in a completely different perspective how was to be a factory worker in the industrial revolution, and it is probably only one of the reasons this movie is so incredible.
It shows the industrial method of repetition and how the manual effort of human beings started to be switched by the fast, accurate and efficient machines.
This movie brings with it the power of surpassing all your expectations. In the first moment you thing all will be about machines, but in a deep understanding and thoughtful conclusion, it was about the human being all the time. How we see ourselves in this mechanic and rational world.
So, consider some of these reasons if you didn't watched then do it. And if you already watched, question yourself about how this masterpiece portrays the human being.""Mostly based on actual facts, L.A. Confidential tells the story of Hollywood in the 50's. Corruption and crimes are growing this time. Drug dealers, prostitutes and murders occupy L.A.
Three cops of entirely different characters are coming forward to investigate on this, in their own style. One policeman is a straight, strict to the law person. Another one is very brutal, low tempered and tough person. And the last one of corrupt, who is doing dirty things for few bucks.
Directed by Curtis Hanson and camera by Dante Spinotti. Technical side is amazing, by all aspects. Cast also did wonderful job. The characterization was so careful and well made. Each person has his own characteristics.
One of the best crime dramas. A Must watch!
#KiduMovie""Taxi driver is a movie that delivers a cinematic experience like very few. It follows the character Travis Bickle in a 70's New York filled with drugs, sex and drink which he hates and wishes never existed. However unfortunately for him it does and he wants to do as much as he can about it and he attempts to but whilst trying to live a 'normal' life. However he soon realises that people aren't what he thought they were.
This constant struggle in accepting society torments him and the audience throughout the movie with tense on screen acting from DeNiro and the sexy yet disturbing score by Mr Hermann.
Altogether whilst this film isn't as simple and playful as the likes of other Scorsese movies such as Casino or Goodfellas, it's certainly one that requires more thought and complexity to the nature of humanity, and for that reason I personally prefer this picture to the rest of his.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Watched the movie after 6 years of its release on the occasion of a late night movie time,although I am a fan and know all the potential of Khan's acting as I saw his best performances-pardes,anjaam,billu,chak de India,fan ,don-2 baazigar and anjaam.

With that in mind, the first Disney animated feature to be released after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a starter in its own right, it opened an era of uneven productions that can be assimilated to dark ages. Although perceived as classics they never inspire the same glee in the eye than the likes of ""Snow White"" or ""Pinocchio"" or ""Mermaid"" and ""Lion King"". But ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" has aged better than most of its contemporary, maybe enough to compete with the legitimate masterpieces.
Now, do kids really care about these technicalities? Speaking for myself, this film is one of my earliest memories, and by that I mean very early. I had vague and foggy visions of the meeting of Pongo and Perdita (and their masters Roger and Anita) in the park, I never forgot the face of Cruella De Vil who was the first villainess I could put a name on, and as a kid who was a bit cowardly, I used to hide behind a table during the TV scene. I simply hated that startling moment where the villainous cowboy's face occupied the whole screen and scared the hell out of Patch, and me in the process (quite a ""mise en abime""). I avoided watching, and later renting, the film maybe because of that moment, but the film didn't avoid me for all that.
Indeed, one of the first books I started to read at the age of 5 was based on the film and at the same time, I used to watch the Disney Channel program and to those who remember, the intro started with the iconic picture of the polka-dotted canine family staring at the TV. This is just the stuff your nostalgia is made on, you can't control it. And for all these reasons, I simply can't formulate a critic against the film without feeling like I'm betraying my inner child. But I'll let the adult speak a little bit: after Christmas, I bought my daughter four Disney classics and I couldn't resist to the temptation. I had to see the Dalmatians, three decades after the first complete viewing. Enough with the princesses, ""Frozen"" and 'let-it-go!' message, how about a family- friendly film about a dog family.
After all these dragon fights and dazzling magic tricks from ""Sleeping Beauty"", there's a sort of cozy and relaxing little charm ""Dalmatians"", conveyed by that opening scene where Pongo tries to find the perfect girl for his master and culminating in the park. The next scene is a revolution; TV in a Disney film. This is an acknowledgment of the role the little screen played on Disney's expansion, and what a wonderfully crafted moment with these puppies staring at their dog hero while we stare at them. TV would even play a part to the story as the two thugs Horace and Jasper will delay their mission because they want to watch ""What's My Crime?"" on TV. As a big fan of the ""What's My Line"" channel on Youtube, I was surprised to find a parody of the program on a Disney film.
But then I remembered that even the great Walt Disney came to the show and promoted the opening of Disney World (or Land). Disney was a pioneer in the sense that he could anticipate the tastes of people but he could also disconcert the expectations and make a film like ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", a family oriented film in the purest sense of the world, perhaps the only Disney with a united family not affected by death, and a great message about it. Even that powerful doggy SOS where, one howl to another, dogs communicate in order to find the puppies find some strong echoes in our era affected by sad kidnapping stories. ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" marks an unexpected entrance from Walt Disney in modernity.
Of course, it had a few undesirable effects such as the constant recycling of images (I spotted that the image of Roger lighting his pipe was reused three or four times) but this is not as blatant as the case of ""Sword in the Stone"" or ""The Aristocats"" and there's obviously an element in the drawing of these little dogs (and the big ones, too) that is admirable. The sketchy drawing and seemingly static background never bothered me anyway because they fit the very kind of stories Disney would start to tell. And the way Cruella De Vil looks is integral to her appeal, she indeed looks like a devil, a monster, but she might be the most 'human' of all Disney villains, maybe the character modern audience can most relate too, she's crazy, obsessive, narcissistic, but she's a woman who backs up her words with actions, she embodies the darkest side of the 'woman-power' and contributes to one of the most thrilling climactic sequences from Disney. Can you believe that after a dragon fight, the next Disney featured a car chase, and one that holds up pretty well by today's standards.
So, it doesn't come as a surprise that she was listed among the Top 50 Greatest Villains from the American Film the Top 50 villains in the American Film Insitute's List among the Evil Queen and the Man from ""Bambi"", not a bad company. So for the villain, the positive message about family (maybe the only Disney where it's a central theme) and the whole 'great escape' plot, ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"", if not the best, is perhaps one of the most endearing Disney feature.
(And I just noticed this is the 100th review this film got, next reviewer will be happy)""Ford Fairlane (Andrew Dice Clay) is known as the Rock n' Roll Detective. He's a hard-smoking, womanizing, Hollywood private eye who is well connected in the music scene. Jazz (Lauren Holly) is his loyal assistant. Everybody pays him in gifts. Lead singer Bobby Black and his band is supposed to be the new sensation. He ODs on stage during a performance. His school friend obnoxious shock-jock Johnny Crunch hires him to find his daughter-sister-daughter Zuzu Petals. Crunch is quickly killed. Investigating cop Lt.

There's a crazed hit-man (Robert Englund) and record executive Julian Grendel (Wayne Newton).
It's crass, it's loud, and it's irreverent. I can certainly see many being offended by Andrew Dice Clay's crude character. For me, it's funny. It's basically an alternate world where Andrew Dice Clay's alter-ego exists. He's actually funnier when he's being a little stupid. There're some fun back-and-forth with Zuzu. For people not easily offended, this is good crass irreverent fun.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Family and friends raced into local theaters hours in advance to grab seats for their latest action-packed and absurdly ridiculous, ""Furious 7."" Since its first installment ""The Fast and the Furious"" in 2001, the franchise has lovingly become a tacky, silver-screen staple for youth all over the world. Haters don't hate. If you've seen one, two or seven of the films by now, you knew exactly what you were in for, and you still showed up.
""Furious 7"" once again took things to the next level with more impossible high-flying stunts and an entire script of quotably profound one-liners about the meaning of family  or how serious a beating one is about to receive. The film expanded on its already large cast by introducing several new actors including Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou and to my enjoyment, Tony Jaa from the martial arts cult-favorite ""Ong-bak"" films. However, this highly farcical sequel was full of bittersweet anticipation as an entire nation gathered, paying tribute to the tragic, early death of actor Paul Walker, by seeing a journey that's lasted for more than a decade now, through to the end.
Walker, who has been around since the beginning, playing one of ""The Fast and the Furious"" original characters, Brian O'Conner, a young undercover cop who infiltrated an East Los Angeles gang of behind-the-scenes outlaws, tragically died in a high-speed car crash on Nov. 30, 2013. After taking time to grieve, shocked ""Furious 7"" crew members delicately moved on with production.
""Furious 7"" ended up destroying box office records during its debut weekend, picking up a massive $143.6 million in North America and $240.4 million overseas; totaling an impressive $384 million overall. Not only did ""Furious 7"" become the largest opener among its predecessors. After its release, it set a milestone by ranking number four in the top 10 highest opening films of all time  proving to be one of Hollywood's most iconic and profitable franchises.
Where do we go from here though? Is this the end of the ""Furious"" franchise? Not for directors and producers. It seems their grieving period ran little-more than a quarter of a mile. The eighth installment by Universal Pictures is currently set to be released April 14, 2017. Surely, many fans will be torn over another sequel, especially one excluding Walker for obvious reasons. My suggestion would be to revisit the idea of branching off on side character stories like they did in the 2006 semi-sequel ""Tokyo Drift."" But, with such a huge fan base and record-breaking turnout for the presumed final installment, Universal can't this cash cow go to pasture in good taste.
It's worth mentioning that producers and directors were more heartfelt in the manner which they handled Walker's passing. Usually in these situations, productions will omit a deceased actor from future scenes or films by letting their character perish as well. In the case of ""Furious 7,"" however, director James Wan decided to see Walker's character through to the end, finishing the film with the help of Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody as stand-ins, and some subtle, well-placed computer effects; giving everyone a final, emotional montage of ""Fast and Furious"" Walker moments  reminding us of the gravity he had on our lives throughout the past 14 years.
Thanks for the lavishly unbelievable, yet genuinely profound journey Paul, giving us all a reason to do hoop-dee burn-outs in theater parking lots across the nation, to live a little faster and burn a little brighter.
""If one day the speed kills me, don't cry, because I was smiling.""  Paul Walker""One flew over the cuckoo's nest shows a Jack Nicholson quite right for the character of Randle McMurphy, it is easy to fall in love with the characters of the psychiatric center, each of them has its very peculiar way of being, We see a Danny De Vito before being famous. This movie shows us that wanting too much control to keep right in a person can also be harmful, the ruthless nurse makes him an easy character to hate. We could summarize that ""McMurphy"" is represented as the freest man who acts against established authority, which constitutes the great act of freedom, or rather, the essential human act. Indeed, he is the only individual within the great mass, who thinks that the act of disobeying and being free is the act of reason. But in this world, freedom has a cost and above all in such an authoritarian system. In general a movie that ends up liking, a brilliant overall performance and a entertaining story.""Chances are, if you've watched any popular movie over the last fifteen years or so, you've probably heard the line, 'The first rule of *whatever* is do not talk about *whatever.*' This is of course the most famous line from the Brad Pitt/Edward Norton 1999 classic, 'Fight Club.' In a nutshell, Fight Club is so good it's spawned many parodies and rip-offs, none of which have even come close to emulating just how good it is.
I'll give you a brief plot synopsis, but leave it there, as if I go into too much detail, I start running the risk of letting slip some major spoilers. Edward Norton plays a bored and run-down salesman who spends his days flying across America selling his wares. However, his dull life takes a turn for the interesting when he happens to bump into Tyler Durden (or rather Brad Pitt) on a plane. The two of them form an unlikely bond and come up with a novel way of dealing with male stress in the modern age  they beat the hell out of each other for fun. And, believe it or not, this idea soon spreads across the nation and 'Fight Clubs' start springing up everywhere.
It's about now in the review where I list the good and bad points of the film. However, I can't actually think of anything negative to say about Fight Club and, if I listed all its plus points then I'd probably be here all day. There's very little wrong with this film in general  it has everything from great central performances from Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter (and even a sterling performance from Meat Loaf  who'd have thought!) to wry social commentary, snappy dialogue and those plot points I refuse to mention for fear of being hounded off the internet for spoiling movies.
As I've already eluded to, there's definitely more to it than the synopsis, but anything more may ruin the surprises in store. Whether you like dark, intelligent thrillers or just want to see Brad Pitt topless, you really should check this film out at some stage. It's already a classic and, even after all these years, holds up very well with its themes of fragile male ego, bonding and the establishment in general.
When I watched it last I felt it had an almost 'Hitchcock-vibe' to it all, which would explain why it all feels so dark and timeless. If you haven't seen it, don't ask people about it, as they may well give away bits of it that will stay with you forever. Just watch it. Then re-watch it again with a completely different view of it all when you know what it's really about.""The most charismatic and human character of Pixar is a robot.

The horrors that Northup faced once he arrived at the plantation were hard to watch, to say the least. The dehumanization and brutality that was endured by so many is heartbreaking to witness. Many slaves were beaten, raped, hung, and essentially stripped of all of their human rights. They were not even given the right to their own name or children. Though I've read about slave conditions in history classes many times, this movie made me realize that I haven't even begun to understand the extent of what happened during this period of history.
12 Years a Slave provides an excellent insight into what slaves had to endure on a daily basis. Though it's difficult to watch, it's necessary for us to try to understand what occurred so we can try to prevent an atrocity such as this from ever happening again.""It is a light-heart old Indian comic , suitable only for the audience from Indian Sub-continent.

But very soon, inside that covered cage comes a free bird who puts up a fight against the world and tries to bring back life from its grave only to make that institution a better and a fairer place. The movie named ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" displays us the fight between a sensible individual and the omnipotent government through the characters of McMurphy and Miss Ratched. McMurphy was sent inside the mental institution after he has pleaded guilty after committing a crime. He is placed under the care of Miss Ratched who only excels in hypotinizing free minds under her evil influence. However, McMurphy always puts up a tough fight against her and questions every rule set by her. But no matter how powerful the arms of the individual it is impossible to lift the immense weight of the myths, government and the nonsensical rules of the society. McMurphy, undeterred by the consequences, goes on fighting till his last breath. But the question is ""whether he will be praised as a hero by the people? Or will he be criticized as a man who was foolhardy enough to even have tried fighting the society?"" Sadly the answer is that society always wins crushing the people under its foot just like hundred grain of sands are washed under the wave of the sea. The same consequences await McMurphy when iron clubs and electric shocks knock out his life breath, squeeze out the spirit of fight out of him and make him as meek as a horse. However, Chief's breakout portrayed the eventual change which is inevitable and cannot be stopped even by the iron whip of the government. This movie with the use of metaphors is fraught with a very valuable lesson that fighting the all powerful is necessary and must be carried out even though the result is fatal.""We often come across a book, that interests us, but somehow we are unable to get to the depth of it. Gradually, as the plot progresses, we feel a bit lost and we ultimately give up. Then after a few days we start reading it again, and the words seem to convey a new meaning to us, opening a new interpretation of the story which urges us to carry forward with it. After multiple trials and errors, when we get the full grip on the plot, we find ourselves completely immersed in it and in someway or the other we find that, it has been the story of our own life that has been said all along or that of a very known acquaintance. Either way, we start feeling connected to it. Tamasha, as a movie, can be compared to a book of this kind. The greater number of times it is watched, the more the feeling of realization will sink in your heart. The story of the two protagonists, is something that every millennial will find connected to. As far as acting goes, words really fall short to describe the acting prowess shown by the two leads, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone. The varied range of emotions, that the script demands, has been aptly portrayed by them,be it the friendly lighter moments or the moments of loss,heartbreak, pain and self discovery. It has been carried out with elan by both of them. Though, this movie does have some similarities with Imtiaz Ali's previous films in bits and parts like 'Love Aaj Kal'and 'Rockstar', he does deliver the old concepts of romance, ambition and values of life in a very refreshing way. The story has been told in a non-linear style, which is definitely very refreshing. In some parts, the script has some flaws, which often threatens the continuity, but the story is enough to make you forget them quickly. And last, but not the least, A.R. Rahman's music, be it the songs or the background score, add a different dimension to the movie itself and helps in carrying out the narrative.""Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie. Baffling however, why they chose to watch it in the first place as it's likely very certain that they knew they were not going to enjoy it.
A quick scan through user reviews here on IMDb will show you an unbeieveble amount of reviews with 1/10 ratings claiming it's 'one of the worst films I have ever seen' or 'complete waste of time and money'.
Why watch a movie from a director you don't like, complain about violence, long drawn out dialogue scenes and unorthodox story- telling of a controversial historical topic? Why complain about plot holes and rate is as 1/10 because of this? People don't like Tarantino yet they still pay their hard earned money and spend their precious time watching his movies at the cinema simply to go home and give their two cents worth of how awful it was and how unintelligent you have to be to be entertained by such garbage.
Inglorious Basterds may not be perfect but it is exactly what I expected from a Tarantino film. It's violent yet not as violent as some of his other works, some of the scenes are graphic but nothing that I would class as morbidly excessive. The dialogue is impressive in stops and starts with a couple of the scenes in the movie being among his best work in terms of dialogue, the opening scene in particular was so tense and perfectly constructed that it truly did showcase Tarantino's skill at creating such great film. Setting the bar so high in the opening scene had a slight negative impact on the rest of the movie though as the remainder of the film couldn't live up to that first scene on the milk farm.
Split into 5 chapters which is essentially 5 long scenes, Tarantino tells the story of a Nazi-occupied France during World War 2, following the harrowing journey of 'The Jew Killer', the backlash of the 'Inglorious Basterds' and the story of a Jew with cold revenge on her mind. There is no sole focus on any one character as the story isn't told through anyone's perspective, the story simply moves through the different characters scene by scene.
We are lead to believe from the movie title and trailer that the movie will focus completely around The Inglorious Basterds. This isn't the case and they act as a cog in a big wheel of different characters, they never really feel like the main people, we are given little back story to them and develop no emotional attachment to them. Brad Pitt was the poster boy for this movie yet he didn't feature half as much as I thought he would and sadly the screen time he did get was quite disappointing. His character wasn't very interesting and contained far too many clichés, often looking out of place and struggling to adapt completely to his role. Some of his script did however add some humor to the movie but the better scenes in the movie were ones which he wasn't a part of. Christoph Waltz was fascinating as 'The Jew Hunter', his calm and somewhat friendly persona makes him so edgy giving you the feeling that he could do anything at any moment. His performance was completely faultless which was by far the strongest aspect of Inglorious Basterds and the best scenes of this movie are ones which he was in.
There are some big plot holes in this movie, which i will not go into as they would contain big spoilers. The plot holes didn't stop me enjoying this movie though as it isn't a movie of realism, you would be a fool to believe that Inglorious Basterds was trying to even attempt that. I don't necessarily think it is down to lazy writing either, I personally think that some of the plot conveniences were purely to move the movie along. Tarantino may have stuggled to fit all of the story he wanted to tell into the two and a half hour run-time and in doing so, possibly in the trimming down process to keep it a respectable length, some of the the plot lines got a little choppy and dysfunctional.
Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a movie made for my tastes so my rating will be high. I can see it isn't a perfect movie and I can acknowledge these flaws however I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said that I didn't enjoy it. The time flew by and i found myself completely captivated in the story, the tense scenes made me tense, the humor hit the spot, the violence was graphic and uncut and the climax to the movie felt fitting and powerful.
Tarantino creates a unique movie experience on a topic which was never going to please anyone. He made complete fiction out of one of the most notoriously disgusting people in the history of the world and did it completely on his terms. I have no issues with that whatsoever.
8/10""Parents, if you are deciding weather or not your kid should watch it. There may be some violent scenes when Voldemort comes back for revenge. Harry Potter realizes that he is a wizard and meets new friends and some unfortunate events/people. Harry Potter realizes that magic can help you through tough times. If you decide that your kids should see this move, they may have a tough time realizing that magic is not real. This movie teaches kids that friends are there for you and can help you achieve greatness. Harry Potter realizes even with a bad family life (Parents who are not there for Harry and a mean uncle/aunt and cousin) he still manages to live a full and adventurous life. This movie is a AMAZING movie and I totally recommend seeing it.""I wasn't going to write a review but I feel there needs to be a positive review amongst the many negative ones. Need for Speed is a great movie. Of course it's cheesy, you pricks. It's based on a racing video game! What were you people expecting? I watched this expecting street racing and action, and that's what I got! Not much of a plot, but the small one that exists is a decent one. Not an Oscar winner here. Mostly a fun movie that is fast paced all the way through and never falls off that course. Don't listen to all the hatred going on here. This is an extremely fun and enjoyable flick. Fast expensive cars, hot women, action, comedy, a little drama. What else do you want from a film that's based on a video game? Come on people, lighten up a bit. 9/10""This movie begins and ends by saying that there are no Sherlock Holmes novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that this movie is based on. It says that it means no disrespect to the man and this is simply how the people who worked on this movie personally interpreted what it would be like if Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson met at an early age. This movie features a young Sherlock Holmes and that's really all you need to know. The most noteworthy thing about film is the special effects. It was the first time in any movie that a full CGI character appeared. It's the knight that appears out of the stained glass window.
I was fearing it would just be a really brief scene but it really is important to the story. Even the DVD advertises the great special effects. Honestly, for a film decades old, they hold up! Of course, this is a good movie for the good writing and the like. I thought Sherlock was narrating at first, but it was actually Watson. We get some really cute set ups to later parts of the Sherlock Holmes mythology. It all pays up at the end with a great climax and be sure to stay after the credits too. I was reminded of ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" which came out the previous year also made by Steven Spielberg. I had no idea he worked on this movie and was so prolific! ***""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Spoiler Alert! For careful watchers Iron Maiden is being played in a short section of movie.
About the movie, visual effects is considerably over intermediate and the story line, the characters ...Also nature is well chosen. Additionally perfect angles and frames are art-like.It is a well told, objective story.The best part of the movie is for a long period of time i saw a movie without USA propaganda or hidden frames of STAR of David.It is an Hollywood-like movie which is not produced in Hollywood studios but a serious contender....
Lastly arms used in the movie are real Turkish Army properties.""I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World Beyond""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Over recent years people seem to have gone off Quentin Tarantino and for the life of me I can't think why. He hasn't made one bad movie ... And of course his most recent was The Hateful Eight. Starring Tarantino regulars Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth as well as relative new comers to Q's distinctive genre, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins and Channing Tatum, The Hateful Eight is a star studded blood filled cinematic encounter of the western variety. The film itself is just one whole intense motion picture that takes up a duration of roughly three hours. After about an hour, give or take there's death after death after death until It's just Jackson and Goggins bleeding to death. Oh yes, there's a lot of blood. As well as the usual Tarantino rules though there's really some fantastic acting given from Jackson and Leigh particularly, in fact there's one infamous scene where Jackson's character tells a tale of homosexual rape. Fantastic acting, but oh my god ... and Leigh as Daisy truly steals the show completely, she's just so despicably evil and corrupt right to the very end. As well as the acting like every other time, the dialogue of Tarantino's script is just perfection. Literally every line is crafted with absolute precision. Oh and If The Hateful Eight wasn't awesome enough, the score is entirely composed by Ennio Morricone. And that's all you need for the movie to be good If I'm completely honest. I have to say, I really don't understand why people are leaving Tarantino's fan-base. He's a brilliant director and he constantly delivers greatness and I can't wait for his next outing.""Tim Burton was ones among them most loved and respected directors and writers in the business with his first films like Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) been some of them and today I will review the later. In Edward Scissorhands, we follow a typical suburban family, who discovers Edward, a gentle, quiet and lovable man, who has a ""small"" issue, he has scissors for hands!! OK, that seems wacky and nuts, but this Burton we are talking about and his style is intense to say the least.
After-wards the family brings him in their home ,where the rest of the community starts to come to see that person ,ho frankly is as unique as it comes. Something I admire is that how they approach Edward, it was totally realistic ,think yourself how would you act if you saw a dude with scars in his face ,in goth clouting and wit huge scissors for hands, this how!! In general the film feels like a modern fairy tale with the mix of Gothic and suburban colorful image.
One other thing that I have to praise is Johnny Depp as the title character. Also this was his first major big screen role. And unlike the ones we all have known and at this is point bored to see, he was completely unrecognizable as Mr. Scissorhands, very little dialogue and he mostly expressed himself through saddle facial moves and body language. Which is also really realistic for he was isolated for years and he didn't have any human contact for years up to now, so yes it is reasonable for him to be a little awkward.
To continue we have also a romance in the film ,which is handle so beautifully that at times you feel sorry for our protagonist for even though he is quit nice, his fantasy , as it is showed by his enterprises when he uses his hands, is of the chart, he can't hang or pet some because of his hands. Pretty sad if you ask me, I mean we often hear about persons, who have incredible strength or possess a deep knowledge of martial arts, but they are unable to be physical with others out of the fear that they would cause intentionally any injury. Now think that Edward has literally sharp blades for hands, it is if not worse, then the next worst thing after the previous examples.
All in all this a modern classic ,with a ending that will make you cry and it is high recommended to any couple or film-buff in general. Also like Princess Bride this is the one of the thousand romantic films that everyone can enjoy!""PATHS OF GLORY is an anti-war film based on the novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb. This is a shocking film, which is inspired by real events, about the shameful incident on the Western Front in the First World War. We've seen the terrifying battleground in the grip of corruption and cynicism.
Kubrick's style became known after this film. Extremely long shots emphasize the importance of a particular scene, a part of the story or some locations.
Black and white photography goes well with the atmosphere and themes in the film. The dark tones, night scenes and human expression provoke strong feelings of anxiety.
The story begins with the agony that goes into the public injustice and ends with the tragedy. One general, on the suggestion of his superior, sent his division across the no man's land in a suicide assault that is bloodily rejected. Three soldiers must pay with their lives for alleged cowardice. However, their colonel reasonably rebelled.... The story of human intrigue, courage and fear of soldiers is honest, direct and explicit. Scenery, referring to the cold, wet and bloody trenches, is amazingly convincing.
Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is a passionate idealist. However, he is only one link in the chain of orders. His character is not a rebel. This is a natural reaction to the apparent injustice. Adolphe Menjou as Major General Georges Broulard is the embodiment of a cunning and ruthless war policy. George Macready as Brigadier General Paul Mireau is a kind of a grotesque. A vindictive character, who is a slave of his own ego.
The end of the film is somewhat cathartic. The soldiers revive forgotten feelings in inhumane conditions of war.
The future is pessimistic, but the struggle for humanity is visible. War is hell, and it is part of one's everyday life. Rotten people survived the war. The innocent are dying. Nothing changes.
Mr. Kubrick is a true master.""I see sooo many negative reviews regarding this film and I get the point. How that there is so many parts which does not make sense. But i just wanna say that there is obviously flaws in most schemes you plot. Amy is portrayed smart and psychotic but it does not mean that she is soooo brilliant that she can come up with a plot which is flawless and make sense to all the audience. The film clearly shows how there is pressure from the society and how much people loves Amy. Police looks at evidence when they investigate a case. Furthermore, they are just town officers. You cant really expect them to deep dive into the case when all of the evidence present are pointing towards Nick. However I don't like any of the characters and they make me so annoyed.""The movie will keep you guessing the entire time. Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey)delivers the best performance of his life. There are so many actors in this film that all deliver from the beginning to the end. This is tough to write without a spoiler. But rest assured you don't want Kaiser Sosa coming after you.
This movie is older now so you will have to look past the fact that it has become dated, but if you are a fan of good acting and a story line that you will never guess until the reveal at the end then this is a film for you to see. BUT WAIT watch the credits there is even more in there.""If you have a family that you live with, briefly think about your home life. Now see if it doesn't to some extent resemble the pathetic family life of the Burnham's or their neighbors. I know mine does. When someone asks you how your day was, how often do you give them a straight answer? Yeah, everything's fine. You've got a steady job, a few dollars in the bank, you're not hungry, and the parents don't beat the kids, and your life's just frickin' lovely. Except that it's not. Because you hate your job or you feel insecure at school, and whenever your mom or dad or kid makes an attempt to ""take an active interest"" in you, it results in nothing more than a facade of fake smiles.
This is what I loved about this movie: the fabulous portrayal of how sad the characters' lives are. The first act in particular is great, showing all of the characters' issues and insecurities. It's funny, but it's also terrible. Seeing Lester fantasizing about Angela as his wife sits right next to him and seeing Carolyn invest so much energy into selling the house at the beginning was so powerful in showing how empty their lives have become. So when the Burnham's started taking some action in the second act, I felt happy for them. It gives them some measure of power over the things that make their lives miserable.
Aside from being an excellent commentary, it was fun to watch. Much like Fight Club, which ironically came out just two weeks after American Beauty, it takes normal people in relatively normal settings and gives them snappy but believable dialogue. I was never bored while watching it either, which shows that it has good pace. Not all of the acting is spectacular, but all of it is good and all of the characters feel realistic and alive. Most of all, though, it evoked an emotional response. There were many times when the scene at hand made me cringe. This may not sound appealing, but it is actually one of the main reasons I would recommend watching it.
To be honest, I can't think of a good reason for anyone over the age of 16 to not watch this movie. If you don't like it, that's one thing. But if you haven't seen it, I strongly urge you to make it a priority because it will put your life into a different perspective. Not only that, it is entertaining to watch in a rather unique way. Overall Rating: 8.5/10.""If you never had the opportunity to read the book of the same title then this film will seduce you enough to read the great works of Tolkien himself.
The book was written by Tolkien after having grown up in Birmingham after emigrating with his mother and younger brother. Tolkien was the master of fantasy literature, his mind brought alive a world in which good and evil, dark and light could easily exist within our times.
Peter Jackson took the book and assembled a high calibre cast, he took the story apart, supported it with a dramatic music score that heightened your senses whilst sat in your seat. The adaptation was magnificent, it drove many of us film fans to the cinemas in droves globally, we demanded more and Jackson delivered Tolkien's Middle Earth alive.
The casting of Elijiah Wood as 'Frodo' and Ian McKellen as 'Gandalf' galvanised the desire to see good triumph, against all the odds, over evil. As you watch, the characteristics of all the main characters are brought alive as you'd have imagined Tolkien would have done himself.
The length of many films now falls shy of two hours but the Lord of the Rings trilogy held the most impatient of film lovers lusting for more. My home town, Birmingham, inspired Tolkien as a young boy and his creativity by the wonders of it's natural beauty. Many tourists came to my home town feeling the magic that brought us together to love Tolkien himself.
This film (and its sequels) brought a greater appreciation of literature to us all, in fact inspiring so many of us to read and imagine so much more.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The free state of Jones was a rather entertaining movie which depicts the struggle of southern people attempting to rebel against the confederacy. whilst the movie is not 100% accurate to true history,it is close. the film had an impeccable balance between modern action movie and subtle historical documentary. you feel an exhilaration during the battle scenes like the church ambush but then a solemness afterwards, for instance,when Daniel is fatally wounded. the movie does a great job of telling the tale of the Jones county rebels in an exciting and interesting way. the whole movie however is not just war, it has a deeper more metaphorical meaning. the character of Moses is fictional and is used to portray the many runaway slaves that knight encountered during his escapade. and the few scenes showing his descendant continuing to encounter issues for the same problems that knight himself fought to fix.""TOUCH OF EVIL is a fascinating crime noir. A city mogul, in a town on the border with Mexico, was the victim of a time bomb, which was planted in his car. American police captain quickly discovers the perpetrator and the evidence against him. Mexican police officer was involved in the investigation and he showed open doubts about the case and evidence. His efforts to uncover the truth endanger his American wife. A direct confrontation between the two cops is inevitable...
This story is not just about the murder of a ""big fish"". The murder was just the trigger for a true plot. Shades of gray are extremely important in this film. Mr. Welles has, through these shades, shadows and sudden movements, revealed traits of the protagonists in this film.
I will not specifically comment on one of the most famous film introductions to the history of cinema. See and judge for yourself. I have repeatedly returned to the beginning of the film.
Each of the protagonist is faced with his own fear and ego. The protagonists will touch evil in this film. The conflict is manifested through two opposing morals in relation to police work and two opposite life philosophys.
The dark atmosphere has overshadowed a complex, emotional and perverse story. Scenery is reflected in the all ""diseases"" of a provincial town, plain and deserted buildings and prairie wasteland.
Orson Welles as police captain Hank Quinlan is fat, morbid, relentless, corrupt and insensitive police officer. Mr. Welles was simply unrecognizable. He is a very interesting character, such as a villain from an animated film, but his actions and manner of performing police duties were almost inhuman. Charlton Heston as Ramon Miguel Vargas is honest, a bit naive and highly moral character. The good guy in the true sense of that word. The voice of reason that almost nobody hears. Mr. Heston is reminiscent of the character who just woke up from a nightmare.
Janet Leigh as Susan Vargas is Miguel's beautiful wife. The evil of this story has come down to her. Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Joe Grandi is quite inconclusive as local thief. Joseph Calleia as Pete Menzies is honest and faithful partner. However, the relationship between him and Hank is quite confusing. Marlene Dietrich as Tanya is a woman out of the shadows and reminder"" from the past. She was involved with several delicious interruptions and life review at the end of the film.
This is a film about corruption, narcotics and power, in which the two men struggling through different visions of justice and face their own hunches and fears.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After spending 4 hours watching ""Gone With The Wind"", I can see why it has been so critically acclaimed since its release in 1939. This motion picture combined many themes and ideas, and consisted of complex and dynamic characters who developed and grew as the story line played itself out. In particular, the protagonist Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly feisty and passionate person who endures countless struggles in order to find happiness and stability once again after the Civil War demolishes her sense of reality. Even though she married 3 times and had more money than she knew what to do with, she always wanted more, more, more. When Rhett left her, the realization of her deep love for and the desire to return to her homeland, Tara, was an excellent way to wrap up the movie and bring the story full circle, as the story begins with dear Scarlett listening to her father tell her about the importance and continuity of land. However, the majority of the film was not as historically committed as it could have been. About halfway through, the focus shifts from the events of the Civil War, to the relationships between the characters. While this may not be a complaint for some viewers, others like myself hoped for a more focused and consistent view on the history of such an important time period throughout the movie. Also, the amount of racism was minimal, which is not true to the sentiments of the Deep South during this era. In summation, though there is some lack of historical accuracy, this film is definitely a must see, even 78 years later.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Perhaps this is the darkest comic book movie adaptation ever done in Hollywood. Taking place on the night before Halloween, Brandon Lee, in his final ironic performance, portrays Eric Draven risen from the grave to obtain revenge and justice against the violent street gang that brutally murdered him and raped his fiancé before they were set to be married. With a look very similar to Tim Burton's Batman and a bit of Blade Runner homages, it is definitely a visual work of art in cinema. This certainly falls into the category of one of those movies that would be very difficult if not impossible to remake. The only minor nitpick I as a viewer have is how Top Dollar kind of steps out of line and cheats against our hero as I like to call it. Luckily, our hero fights back and teaches him a lesson through grief.""I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I wasn't at the end of my seat unable to take my eyes off it, but I never once scoffed at something happening (which I do to many movies when they blunder). This was a change in direction of vampire movies. I like most vampire movies and think people imagining them in many ways is great. From Nosferatu, to 30 days of night, to Van Helsing; they all entertain me. But this was a movie that you would want to share with anyone. Not overly romantic or overly horrific in any means. The pictures were great, the story was great, and it made you wonder and think. I also like how the movie makes you think back to many events to come up with a different fate of the characters. I give it a 9 because I wasn't absolutely shell shocked at how good it was like I am occasionally, but I do think it is a really great movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Now I gotta say, this movie got guilty pleasure ratings. well the Animation is still better, but this is confusing people, this movie starts off on that dangerous nightmare called Shopwells, (S#*t said Frank) I'm not aware they put effort in this movie about how both Good or Bad, Best or Worst.
SPOILER ALERT
Why are foods are moving, Ghost?
Why do they kill people on purpose!
They thought religious people are gods, but we are Humans because of Jesus and other angel people when humans in heaven and earth, Food people thought there going to die in hell, but they died when they went into the humans body, and now they went into the Toilet since there dead.
1 problem about this movie, why did you animate moving food when humans thought there ghost, but I'm asking you if it's still a flop on the box office even it failed a little bit or no.
This Movie is more confusing for adults but it's just a made-up movie where Fire Water says that where cartoons but showing this movie? WTF am I watching, is this a fetish film to watch or is it porn at the ending in this Movie, why they make money for this comedy film, don't make a sequel for this, I will give this movie 8/10, why 8/10? because I find it more food-ish and confusing.""Mr. Chaplin's pièce-de-résistence, MODERN TIMES is his last silent feature, but rendered with an innovative adulteration of sound voices solely from mechanical devices, barring Chaplin's near-end humorous performance of THE NONSENSE SONG, for the very first time, audience hears the maestro's real voice from the screen in a gibberish ditty, one could only imagine the hype and excitement at then.
MODERN TIMES introduces Chaplin's iconic screen alter-ego aka. little tramp as an assembly-line worker in the Depression era, the factory's pristine props hark back to Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927), but less futuristic, more realistic in its scale of grasping capitalism under the efficiency- prioritizing doctrine whereas a proletariat like the tramp, has no means to secure an auspicious future and is inescapably subjected to the exploitation by the industrialized society, picked as a guinea pig for a novel lunch-feeding contrivance, constantly under the duress of the ever- accelerating assembly-line, after being engorged by it (a brilliant surreal light-touch), he is driven mad and wreaks havoc on the machine and is sent to hospital, subsequently, being mistaken as a Communist and thrown into the prison, where he accidentally becomes a hero by thwarting a jail- break attempt, but ironically because he is high on cocaine, which he mistakes for salt in his lunch. Yet, whenever he is given a new lease on life, reality will cunningly squash his effort although in some cases, he has only himself to blame for. There is a skewering political spin aiming at the modernized assembly line, the humongous machines, the callous industrialists and the oppressive authority, being buried underneath the surface of bang-up farces, which has been scarcely actualized in Chaplin's works before.
The plot mainly consists of a string of superlative skits de rigueur, which is completely in Chaplin's elements, the tramp's free-flowing pantomime, delightful slapstick and ingeniously devised set pieces (although the stomach-churning duet crops up as a head-scratcher) are typically endearing to watch, what is more astonishing is how he can make tough stunts look incredibly effortless, in particular with sleight of hand, an arresting trompe l'oeil is accomplished when he roller-skates blindfold against a matted painting which puts viewers at the edge of their seats for his safety. The story also presents a fiery heroine, the gamin (Goddard), a recently orphaned girl who is anything but a damsel-in-distress, Goddard, although is not endowed with Chaplin's bent of physical comedy, is impeccably elemental in foregrounding the gamin's gallantry and loveliness, takes on a weighty counterpart against the tramp's unostentatious playfulness, together, they help each other out in the difficult times, share bitter-sweet moments. A self-encouraging coda might betray Chaplin's precaution that comedy has its built-in calling to look on the brighter side, by and large, MODERN TIME is a reverberating showcase of Chaplin's competence which further transcends its time and context.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Okay, so as a kid this was one of my favourite films. But as you grow up things change and on second viewing, I found this film to be surprisingly slow in places and actually comes close to outstaying its welcome towards the end. These aren't big flaws, mind you, but ones which niggle at me and make me feel as if I'm betraying a universal dream in some way. The truth is that I far prefer the second and third entries in this series, as they don't have to go through the troubles of introducing all the characters, and instead can simply continue the action at a fast speed.
There are many good things about this film to make it worthwhile, though. This is one of those movies with a comic book feel to it which can appeal to adults and children alike. There's a sufficiently 'epic' nature to the film, in that a whole other universe has been created and we are merely viewing a part of what happens in it. There's plenty of action, ranging from the traditional light-saber fights to some exciting space skirmishes. The huge budget allows for many, many different special effects. Some of these look a little ropey today but they're all infinitely superior to the overblown, laughable CGI antics in THE PHANTOM MENACE, where all touch with reality was lost.
The characters are likable and clear-cut; you've got heroic heroes and evil villains. Mark Hamill is fine as Luke Skywalker, although it's sad that he never achieved success in any other movies NOT in the STAR WARS series. Harrison Ford provides a clean, charismatic action man in Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is pretty and funny as Princess Leia, and Alec Guinness lends heavyweight support to the whole affair with his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only downside to the cast are the inclusion of the robots C3P0 and R2-D2 and Chewie, who are, seen today in an adult light, pretty irritating, it has to be said. But for kids, they're funny.
The villains always tend to be the best guys in these films and this is no exception. Darth Vader is THE king of cool, and I always wanted to be him when I was younger. It's strange to think how strongman Dave Prowse when from being the monster in Hammer's lame HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN to becoming one of the biggest screen villains of all time. One also mustn't forget the contribution of Peter Cushing in what was his most popular movie; he lends gravity to the movie and is excellent as the icy commander of the Death Star, mainly through his voice alone.
Although this is a long film, the action is split up across a number of different planets in order to make it more interesting. There are laser battles, lots of shooting, brief gore (an arm-lopping), and all manner of weird and wonderful rubbery alien creatures to make it enjoyable. I especially loved the scene in the garbage disposal unit which uses the old ""closing walls"" routine on our heroes to great effect. This is a deservedly famous movie which kick-started a whole new mythos, brought a legion of movie nerd fans together and harked back to the great days of the sci-fi serials of the late '30s and '40s. Not the best of the series, but pretty darned good going.""2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.
Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui.
It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since.
The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind.
Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man.
Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Kevinyou're two-for-two with SOLID back-to-back best of the year film choices that most haven't even seen, or even heard of. But, I blindly take your word for it and haven't been let down.
Let's just begin with: Kubo and the Two Strings BETTER win the Oscar for Best Animated category plus Best Song for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps."" I wouldn't be opposed to this winning overall best picture, but we know they don't do that. Sadly.
This movie was absolutely amazing. From story, to visuals, to creativity, to score, to (again) song, to jokesthis feels timeless and I just saw it for the first time. While the script and ideas aren't 100% fresh, it felt like a new breath of fresh air on an old fable.
Basically, a single mother is rightfully overprotective of her child, Kubo, but he disobeys her and the dark forces she was trying to protect him from find them. In a story he thought he was either making up or retelling, he begins to live it in order to eventually confront his stalkers.
I just gave the absolute gist of the story since it's best you just experience it for yourself. While the movie feels a tad Disney-inspired with some slapstick sidekicks, it makes it its own and correctly never lingers on the jokes that truly made me laugh out loud more than a few times. It knew it wasn't another company's and kept to the universe it beautifully created.
While it's out there  I'm guessing this is a Studio Laika trademark since this is only my third film I've seen of theirs  it stays enough grounded for viewers to understand the film's mystical realm and rules. And while some themes are a little more adult and others dark, it's good enough for kids, just not too young. Adults, like myself, can marvel at a movie that we would've loved as a kid.
It's certainly a movie not to be missed, especially for its fun adventure, comedic timing/lines and story beyond just animation. Relive your childhood here and take a wild trip in one of the best movies of the year.
***
Final thoughts: Kevin, I mentioned above, announces his top three best of the year on his final ""Fat Guys at the Movies"" podcast/radio show of the year. And each year I immediately go to that movie I've either heard about, but haven't seen or see it completely cold just because of his recommendation. In the past two years, he's been spot on: 2015's incredible Sicario and now, 2016's Kubo and the Two Strings. Both completely worth checking out, much like Kevin's awesome podcast. Look for his show online and you won't be disappointed either.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""The Killing"" is the first film by Stanley Kubrick that was financed entirely by others believing in his talent, and we could not hope for more. The film is thrilling and follows the classic Hollywood gangster story, but with the touch of the genius: as always in his pictures, the characters are watched from a distance, a sneer that knows their efforts to make things go their way is useless, as the world works in mysterious ways, such that a series of small accidents can destroy the ""perfectly"" planned robbery. As usual nobody gets what they wanted in a Kubrick film. The time labyrinth through which the viewer is introduced to the events is also a feature that will come back in an even more complex way in the author's mature works.
A fantastic noir/gangster movie, filled with Kubrick themes.""Reviewed October 2011
Had put this off for a while now, and the wait was totally worth it. It's plot and screenplay were adjusted to comfortably pave way for the one man show and he didn't disappoint at all.
It's story follows the overly rated concept of American dream and one man dead set to achieve it no matter what. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) hits an oil well independently with his expertise on engineering and determination which rouses the entrepreneur in him. During this encounter, one of his partner falls to death leaving behind his infant son who later goes under the care of Daniel who raises him as his own. He starts acquiring, collaborating or forcibly taking off oil wells across the area with his influence and wealth and so does his name starts getting a reputation. Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) approaches Daniel with information of an undiscovered oil well near his place for a little monetary price. Daniel goes to explore this place along with his son where he encounters Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano) who is a local preacher/healer. From here, it is just a step above ploys by both to take control of the people of the area.
Daniel Day-Lewis gives a chilling performance of a man obsessed with power and ego. This can well be expected of him. What comes as a surprise package is the performance of Paul Dano as the preacher with equal amount of ego as Daniel but always waiting for an opportunity to bring it out. Apart from the performances, I found nothing amusing in the movie as the plot and screenplay were pretty standard.
If excellent performances drive you nuts, I advice you to watch this right away.""Christopher Nolan's most recent film is an epic adventure in space filled with science and philosophy as the characters go into an interstellar expedition in order to save humanity. It is I think the British director's most mature work and it could have been his best picture if not for its disappointing ending. One can't avoid drawing comparison to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (one of Christopher Nolan's favourite films). Interstellar is indeed an odyssey of its own, but it ultimately fails where 2001 succeeds.
Before I talk about the ending, I want to comment on how good the rest of the film was. It was amazing! Everything about it was a masterpiece: the visual effects, the score, the imagery, the story, everything. Most of all though, the dialogues. As I mentioned above the film also gets philosophical at times amidst the so well-researched scientific script. You listen to the astronauts talking about supermassive black holes and the next moment they discuss about love being a total mystery that overcomes the barriers of space and time. It was much more though-provoking than I expected. The idea alone that a time may come when earth won't have the necessary ingredients to sustain human life is terribly frightening. The main theme of the film I think is survival and how far people are determined to go in order to survive. What would you do if you have to choose between the people you love and the preservation of the human kind? I hope we never come to face this dilemma.
And then comes the the ending. This is where everything goes wrong. We discover that the ghost and these 5-dimension beings are actually future humans who have evolved into much more powerful beings and allow for Cooper to send messages in the past to help the people of his age. Then, we learn that Murph and her team managed to create a station that can travel in space and save a lot of people, Cooper somehow is transferred there from the black hole and Brand starts a new human colony in the third planet. All this carefully taken care of scientific background becomes something closer to fantasy. First of all there's the predestination paradox we so often come across in sci-fi movies. How did future humans survive if they needed Cooper to send these messages to NASA? And even if there is an explanation for that as some people claim, why didn't future humans make things a bit easier? They could travel through time and they supposedly created the wormhole that made the whole plan possible. Couldn't they create a wormhole next to the earth so that everyone could be saved? Couldn't they inform people about the best possible planet? And if NASA created a station in space that could sustain life for thousands of people, couldn't it do the same in the Earth saving many more? Maybe Christopher Nolan just wanted a happy ending. Maybe he wanted to satisfy people who didn't care much about science. For me, the last minutes only managed to ruin my impression of the previous 2 hours.
In any case Interstellar is a great and very engaging film and its technical aspects are amazing. The ending made the plot seem a bit faulty, but this doesn't make it a bad film. In fact I would recommend it to everyone. You never know, maybe there is a pretty good and scientific explanation for everything and I'm completely wrong. Maybe this is why 2001 is better. Kubrick knew which answers he could answer and which he could not. So instead of coming up with some out-of- place explanations about the monolith and evolution, he just leaves everything open for interpretation letting the movie speak for itself. I wish Interstellar did the same.

After the arrival of a Japanese immigrant, a series of bizarre murders begin to occur, committed by the various townspeople who seem to be under a zombie-like spell. The situation becomes personal, however, when Jong-Goo's young daughter begins to exhibit symptoms similar to those of the murderers.
While Japan has been a majorly recognized force in horror cinema, it wasn't until ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" was released in 2003 that neighboring South Korea was really on the map for international genre fans. ""The Wailing"" is a fine addition to the horror canon, and an unexpected one. The first half of the film is marked by wry dark humor and intelligent dialogue, and is at times so witty, you wonder if you are watching a horror film; that is, until you are reminded by violent and disturbing encroachments. The latter half of the film is remarkably darker in tone and spirit, and feels like a through-and-through horror film. While this shift in tone does leave the film feeling a bit odd in terms of balance, the upshot is that you're likely absorbed enough by the mid-point that you're in it for the long haul anyway.
Moody cinematography and atmospheric shots of the desolate mountain landscapes give the film a distinguished ominous sensibility, and there are some fantastically gruesome scenes interspersed throughout that give the greatest of zombie flicks a run for their money. The performances in the film are phenomenal and lend the proceedings further credibility. Do-won Kwak's performance as the troubled father/policeman is raw and realistic, while Hwan-hee Kim's performance as his possessed daughter is unbelievably goodin the ranks of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist,"" as far as I'm concerned. Some have expressed dissatisfaction with the conclusion, which is somewhat understandable; it does leave room for interpretation, no doubt. That said, I think the primary reason so many have felt let down by it is merely because the film is so longrunning over two and a half hours, I think many people are expecting a more explosive payoff, which we don't get (nor do I necessarily think we should). The final act is truly disturbing, and is both visceral and spiritual in equal measure.
All in all, I was completely absorbed by the world created in ""The Wailing."" Riddled with tension, it burns slowly from beginning to end, with occasional spurts of grotesque violence, and is rife with religious overtones and themes; the acting makes it all the more engrossing. While it does run a bit long, the film never lost my interest, which is rare. It's not every day that I see a film that is able to both completely absorb me and also maintain consistent intrigue, no less a horror film. 10/10.""Veteran filmmaker William Friedkin brings some cinematic flair to this film, Tracy Letts' screen adaptation of his own play. Considering that Friedkin had created one of the finest horror films of all time, ""The Exorcist"", and one of the finest cop vs. crook thrillers ever made, ""The French Connection"", it's interesting to see him go back to a more intimate sort of filmmaking. This story has a scant few characters, a very limited number of locations, and a hook that shouldn't really be taken at face value.
Ashley Judd is luminous in a deglamorized character role as Agnes, a honky-tonk waitress who one day makes the acquaintance of a stranger, Peter (Michael Shannon, who played this part on the stage). Peter starts out as normal but soon reveals some major psychoses, with a particular fixation on the tiny, tiny insects that are supposedly living under his skin, feeding, and breeding. It does not take very long for the vulnerable Agnes to be susceptible to his words and actions.
The acting quintet is rounded out by Harry Connick Jr. as Jerry Goss, Agnes' no-good ex- husband, Lynn Collins as the saucy R.C., and Brian F. O'Byrne as a dedicated doctor. They're all good, but ""Bug"" truly belongs to Judd and Shannon for 102 minutes. They just act their hearts out, and keep you riveted even as things get increasingly strange.
The final third is the most stylish and bizarre, with Friedkin and company creating a memorable vision, and feel of madness. While the director and screenwriter don't miss opportunities for humor, they remain true to the overall grim tone of the material.
Although not exactly a conventional horror film (that might be suggested by the title), it is creepy in its own way, and is gory and visceral enough to suit certain tastes.
Friedkin and Letts reteamed for the equally compelling ""Killer Joe"" several years later.
Eight out of 10.""In 2008 I had the pleasure of visiting the Orthodox Church of St. Cyril and Methodius in Prague where the final scenes of Anthropoid are filmed. A well-dressed, elderly, gentleman was waiting for a tour group to arrive to guide them around the church. On learning I was British he asked me to join the group as it mostly comprised American students and so he would be conducting the tour in English. If he had sat down and written a book I would have sat down and immediately read it. He was a Czech Jew who had survived the war in hiding in Prague and so could personally remember many of the events he was describing. At the end of the war, being fluent in several languages, he had been recruited by the US army to serve as an interpreter at the Nuremberg war trials. In that capacity he personally met many of the individuals responsible for the holocaust and the deaths of the people closest to him. He had, remarkably, largely reconciled himself to what had happened during the years of Nazi occupation and the years of Soviet occupation that followed. He bore no grudges against the Western powers for surrendering his country at Munich or to the Germans who occasionally visited the church. His main concern, and the reason he conducted the guided tours, was the lack of interest or awareness among people, and young people in particular, of what had happened during the war and the sacrifices millions made standing against Nazi Germany, often, as in this case, against impossible odds. He may not be alive now but, if he is, I hope he thinks this film is a fitting tribute. I certainly did.""I am totally moved by LION. What an extraordinary cinema. Sunny Pawar as Sharoo (junior) is a magnificent discovery by LION team. His outstanding performance cherished the film start to end and stunned everyone. Dev Patel did a astonishing work. His emotion touched everyone and i am overwhelmed with his performance. Nicole Kidman was great. Her expression was excellent. Rooniey Mara was good. The scene between Riddhi Sen (the restaurant boy) and Sunny Pawar was surely one of the best scene of this movie. The way director Garth Davis created the emotional scenario, it able to emote every scenes and touched everyone. And, the last scene, after movie end - how it signify whole matter is pretty awesome. The way it moved me, it is truly praiseworthy.""The Little Girl lives with The Mother. Her father is absent with the exception of his gifts of glass globes. She fails her interview for the prestigious Werth Academy. Her mother moves them into the wealthy neighborhood for the school. Their home is the cheapest due to their eccentric new neighbor. It's the summer holidays and mother has set a scheduled regiment for the little girl to prepare for her long march to adulthood. Their neighbor is The Aviator. He becomes the Little Girl's best friend as he describes his adventures with The Little Prince.
I read The Little Prince for french class. It was tough enough to translate the thing. Plenty went over my head especially something like the Rose. One needs to appreciate the adult relationship being portrayed and also its autobiographical nature. The essentially literary nature of the book makes it more than a children's book. It's never been for the littlest kids although they probably like the pictures. The film takes the essentials of the book and adapts it into a cinematic Pixar-level movie. It's really the best of both worlds being combined here.
There is a switch in the world around the start of the third act. It concerned me a little about the execution. It would have been a lot easier to switch to the book instead. The Fox probably kept my faith with his humor. He is hilarious. Mr. Prince is a little problematic. It's like making Peter Pan grow up and I didn't appreciate that in Hook. However, it is all very audacious and it pulls everything together in the end.
There are many complaints about what this movie isn't. It isn't a kiddie movie and this isn't trying to be an ""Ice Age"" movie. It's digging into deeper material and I compare it more with ""Where the Wild Things Are"". That movie is definitely too dark for little kids. This isn't a simple transcription of the book. The book is unlikely to be good narrative for a two hour movie. This is able to translate this literary classic into a compelling movie structure. It's a heart-warming coming-of-age story as long as one haven't forgotten.""Brilliant.
Make love not war .
""In peace sons bury their fathers , in war fathers bury their sons""
Not the film I was expecting at all . Having purposely not read reviews beforehand I was expecting a Hollywood war film saying we are American we are great and promoting the glory of war , glossing over alleged war crimes by the allies and just showing the enemy as evil without any balance portraying their enormous losses of some 100,000 Japanese soldiers killed and half the civilian population of 300,000 died as opposed to 20,000 losses on the allied side in total during the three month battle for Okinawa. So I was not expecting to enjoy the film at all and the opening scene confirmed my fear.
However from then on the film took completely different twist. It was a Very sympathetic moral personal journey of the main protagonist sympathetically played by Andrew Garfield . Excellent supporting cast particularly Hugo Weaving as the father .
You grow to really admire Private Doss as do his colleagues eventually , his undoubted heroism shows that there is more than one way to be patriotic . I'm not going to go into more detail so as not spoil the plot but will just say this is a blood and guts war film for people who do not like war films as well as a war film for those who like action with a romantic twist to boot.
The set of Maeda escarpment was excellent and cinematography revolutionary in terms of Its realism and with some irony was similar to the battlefield of Gallipoli , a film that starred Mel Gibson the excellent director of Hacksaw Ridge .
The best three films of 2017 so far have ALL been based on true stories LION , SULLY and HACKSAW RIDGE
If like me you were thinking this wasn't your sort of film don't hesitate , go see it , only two films have surpassed this in 2017 and none of them were Lalaland !""Alfred Hitchcock has being cited today as the ""Master of Suspense"". A creative genius and tour de force within Hollywood. With a 50-year legacy under his belt, he inadvertently pioneered the way for filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan - Although imagine if ""Split"" was released in 1960, the year of another classic ""twist"", the year of ""Psycho"".
See, during the release of ""Psycho"", Hitchcock made a lot of shocking requests - forcing his crew, and actors into secrecy, creating faking promotional posters citing ""heart attacks"" upon watching, he even went as far as instructing theater owners not to let people in after the film began, which was strongly enforced. If ""Split"" had this marketing behind it, it could have potentially become the year's most talked about film, perhaps decade. Although I feel I must say ""Split"" is truly one of Shyamalan's best in a long time, and certainly movie fans and critics alike will leave the theater ""Split"" - Pun intended.
Three girls (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula) are kidnapped by a man named Kevin (James McAvoy) with dissociative identity disorder, who has 23 prominent personalities, each with peculiar or dangerous idiosyncrasies, who intends to prepare the girls for the arrival of ""The Beast"".
Anya Taylor-Joy (""The Witch"") plays Casey Cooke. Once again captivating in a role that doesn't require much of her. Now I should be honest and say, unlike the other two victims, Casey is strong willed and smart with the choices she makes. But her overall arc is something of a mystery until the final act. Stoic and timid, for the first two acts of the film, her eyes speak volumes, holding her own against McAvoy's Kevin. A creative choice on Shyamalan's part, as Anya plays her with caution, allowing you to perhaps doubt her intentions in the end game.
Haley Lu Richardson (""The Edge of Seventeen"" and Jessica Sula (""Recovery Road"") portray Claire and Marcia, who unlike Casey, impulsively plot their escape within each scene. Both actresses are fine in their respected roles but like ""Marion Crane"" in ""Psycho"", Shyamalan chooses not to flesh them out or focus the story on them.
Betty Buckley (""The Happening"") returning for another go-around with Shyamalan playing Dr. Karen Fletcher, a psychologist who attempts to help Kevin. Her devotion and love to her patients, Kevin, in particular, is earnest and loving, as she truly wants nothing more than to help and understand (D.I.D.).
James McAvoy (""X-Men: Apocalypse"") as Kevin is perhaps given the best role of his career (If you count ""Filth"", ""Atonement"", and ""Trance"") as the Scottish actor not only manipulates 23 different voices, four whom in particular are fully developed, he vigorously changes and manipulates his body - Distinguishing all 23 personalities, including the arrival of a ""24th personality"".
Shyamalan who wrote and directed has cited this as one of the hardest films to make in his career. With 2015's ""The Visit"", Shyamalan has expressed interest in focusing on movies he wants to make, with a smaller budget and shroud of secrecy Shyamalan may be back in his wheelhouse.
Despite the success of the film, it has received backlash and criticism for Shyamalan's beliefs in (D.I.D.) ""Split"" unlike his previous movies will raise intentional questions, forming more theories for Shyamalan to embrace over time.""I loved this movie. The amazing creativity this has makes it a fun experience. Miyazaki-sama did a fantastic job. Speaking of Miyazaki- sama, there is a part of this that connects to his life. Of course he did not see a giant creature at a bus stop, that is ridiculous! What it is is that when growing up, his mother had spinal TB.
Somewhat, the promotioning is funny. The logo is made in the writing font-...OK I DON'T NEED TO EXPECT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE THE STAR WARS LOGO!!!!
If you look closely on the poster, there is only one girl. Why is that? Well, Miyazaki-sama, originally wanted one seven year old. But, for suspense, he multiplied the age of the girl by two and made one girl ten and the other four.
Fascinating. I recommend.""This is one of the best films ever made. Somehow by divine providence, this gem got buried after its initial (and somehow unbelievably unsuccessful) run, and seemed doomed to be a lost Capra classic. But then it came into public domain and was revived by TV where it came into classic status as a beloved holiday film. Having seen it so many times, I almost forgot how good the acting, set design, and direction are. Look and you will see the subtleties crammed into every nook and cranny. The movements of the extras. The lived in feel of the town. The sidewalk walkers and animals roaming around. Everything breathes realism, yet the story is not one of stark realism, but of ideals.
And therein lies the classic feel of this film. Capra wanted a quasi real town that showed the ideal community he wanted to live in. Filled with flawed and normal people who are tempted to fall, but who rise to the occasion and help each other out. They don't do this of their own accord. They are inspired to it by the protagonist, George Bailey. It is his self-sacrifice that brings out the best of them. And then they get to help him out in his hour of need. It makes for a story that brings tears to the eyes every time I watch it.
This is one of those timeless classics that gets better with age. You feel like your putting on your favorite album you haven't heard in awhile or pulling out a photo album of happy memories you haven't seen in a few years. All of the actors fulfill their roles, from protagonist to extras. Great detail was put into the character relationships, making them seem like a real small town community where everyone knows each other. And they embody the goodness of man that, although tarred by sin, was put in there by God. If it's idealism is not completely realistic, it is nevertheless inspiring as the American town that we all wish we had grown up in. In that way, it is even relevant as a film of happy ideals during hard times. We need this kind of communal inter-dependency as we enter into dark times of 2017.""The shots and overall style of Unforgiven is similar to that of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. It throws us back, then encompasses us out of 1992, and brings us to the golden era of Westerns, and then it takes us to an almost neorealist aspect about our characters. Clint Eastwood successfully blurred the lines of good and bad in Unforgiven. He ties us to morally questionable yet, empathetic, -weak, but pure characters, in a seemingly unexciting series of events, and showcases the human psyche of an aged gunslinger.
Unforgiven takes a tone with westerns that haven't been fully explored. It focuses on the humane aspects of the old west more than most Westerns, sought to. Unforgiven is a story about morality, regret and lies coupled with the diverse and dynamic parallels between all the characters. make Unforgiven is an instant classic that keeps the audience thinking from the beginning to end, it shines above and should be revered to most westerns.""I'd like to start this with one important statement: Representation matters. I don't care if some of you dislike this review but I since I can, I'm gonna say what I want to. I hope I didn't offend anyone in this.
I really don't understand why some people are whining about this film, before they even watch it. Especially those who said it's ruining the original  or worse, their childhood. By all means, I'm quite sure Paul Feig, Katie Dippold and the four ladies didn't mean it like that. Like Kate McKinnon, I was born the same year the first film came out. Thus when I was a kid, Ghostbusters is a very well- known brand name. There were people already cosplaying as Ghostbuster. The theme song, Ecto- 1, the firehouse replica, you name it and we, even though we're quite faraway in Southeast Asia, got 'em all.
Basically, when you talk about films, there's this sense that every single time they reboot something we're like, ""Nothing beats the original."" I love films. I give every single one a chance. I probably did it too few times, but I have never been so bitter about reboot versions. They're people's hard work. If you don't like it then don't, but there's no need to be so rude about it. There's no need to attack people in it, especially when they are from particular gender, race, religion, etc.
With that, I'd like to note the four leading ladies are talented. You must admit there's chemistry between Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones. They work as a team, fit together like the original four guys. Don't tell me you did not see the way Kate steals every scene she's in. Holtzmann didn't have much to say but you can't take her eyes off of her and silly gestures she did. Don't tell me you did not see Kristen's emotion. She made Erin the most conflicting character, so complex you want to explore her more, want to see deeper. Don't tell me you did not see how Melissa is very passionate. We are basically feeling what Abby feels, to the point we'd like to yell with her. And please don't tell me you did not see the lightness Leslie brought. Patty is more than additional member, she's the beacon and the map and the voice of reasons.
Overall, I'd like to say that despite your hate, there are people (like me) who love it. I'd like us all to get along and respect each other's opinion. It's okay to like it, it's quite fine to hate it. But we ladies would like to see ladies as leading heroes that doesn't have to be sexy or seducing. I don't know what you see but I see a plus size, a queer, an anxiety-ridden social awkward, and a woman of color kicking arse. I feel represented. There are so many little girls out there feel represented. This isn't some feminist agenda to make you all forget the original one just because there are men in it. It's simply important and I am sorry some of you don't feel that way.
I'm sorry for writing such a long review. Thanks a lot, if you're reading this.""This is one movie where critics say ""no way"". But audience ""absolutely love it"". One of the most intense movies I have ever seen.
Great acting and dialogues. You definitely would cry while watching it. Good direction and cinematography. Great songs and BG score. This movie should have done great.
Started this movie at 1:20 am and I was so into the movie that it's almost 4:00 and here I'm writing review.
I just don't write lengthy reviews. (ignore)
Feels slow for one who doesn't feel the movie. Hero is good. Heroine is also good. Couldn't even stop at title because of the soundtrack.""Dr. Strange is another Marvel classic-with its fun and extremely well choreographed fight scenes, hints of comedy to even out the serious subject matter, and complex, interesting characters. Benedict Cumberbatch seems like he was born to play the Role of Dr. Strange, and will definitely live up to any expectations you may have. The only complaint I have about the movie is the somewhat excessive use of CGI in several scenes. In most Marvel movies, the CGI is used only when necessary, and it's clear that the actors are used in as many scenes as possible, whereas in Dr. Strange, the CGI could be distracting, and made it a bit difficult to suspend disbelief in some of the scenes. Other than this small issue, Dr. Strange was still just as fun and exciting as other superhero movies that recently came out, but also had more thought-provoking and interesting themes throughout. Overall, Dr. Strange was a fun and interesting film that you're sure to enjoy-just try not to get too distracted by the CGI.""Having just come back from watching this and had to give my opinion...
Brilliantly acted ..Mr Deisel really has improved as of late..
Brilliant direction...draws us right into the action and plot
Brilliant story of world wide terror..
Brilliant stunt work and action sequences..
All the extras do a brilliant job
This should really clean up at the Oscars instead of all the so called "" Real "" movies..
I hope they make at least 3 more sequels.
if you have not guessed by now , I am being totally sarcastic , but as I could not find the words to show my contempt for this drivel I thought sarcasm could do a far , far better job!!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I'd be lion if I said I sometimes didn't obsess for years to find something or someone from my past. Though, mine seems a ton more trivial now.
Talk about cultural differences. It might happen in America, but I doubt the outcome would be the same.
This sometimes heartbreaking story tells the true tale of a five-year- old boy getting separated by his older brother in India. He is virtually trapped on a train car for days and the people who do see him and his cries for help lands on deaf ears. Once finally released from the cab, he's lost, taken and eventually sold (I guess) to an Australian couple. So off he's whisked to Australia, grows up and finally hit with the overwhelming need to find his first homeand mum.
His two year obsession nearly destroys his adult life, relationships and adopted mother. This is a story of a lost boy grown up and attempting to retrace his steps from shaky memories now 25 years later and from when he was only five.
Heck, I remember some of when I was five years old, and though I didn't have such a tragedy occur, I am uncertain if I could recall enough details to put the pieces back together. I don't even know if I even knew my parent's real names back then. Worse, for this person, he has only his memory to rely on verses any records, people or places to recall.
Again, I doubt this would happen (as badly) in the United States, but according to this film, this happens, ah-hem, 80,000 times a year. Egad! They have issues.
I did truly like this film and had a string of emotions throughout. Started with anger on how poorly strangers and agencies dealt with an obviously lost young child. And, mercifully, he did end up with a loving family, it still was terrible he was all-but snatched away and sold as property. But the emotional journey of him attempting to reconnect with his biological family was when the movie peaked and provided a pleasant hope. Definitely worth seeing.

Final thoughts: Unfortunately, I have little, in-person contact with foreigners and I would like to. Coincidentally to me seeing this, I get to spend some time with a friend coming from Peru for the very first time to the States. I get to take him to Vegas, Disneyland, Hollywood and a few other places within driving distance of Phoenix, AZ. Can't wait for him to visit and for me to learn more from someone outside the country in about a week.
Let's just hope he doesn't board a train without me and I have to spend the next 25 years looking for him!""I have seen the film 3 times since it came out. Twice on standard screens of varying quality and once on IMAX in 3D. As expected the IMAX experience was the best by far and enhances the film even more but the main thing that has come out of the multiple viewings is that my estimation of the film is far greater. This is my first review on IMDb and sitting during the thrilling climax it came to mind to do it. I am going to try to get across what i had in my mind at that time to make me want to take this step and do the review.
I am a Star Wars fan for sure. Not an obsessed one but it's purely down to seeing the first film at 10 and then growing up with the films in those impressionable years. I wasn't particularly bothered about episodes 1-3 and didn't even see Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith in the cinema, but The Force Awakens was a superbly constructed episode. I was intrigued when i heard about Rogue One when i heard about it, and once the main story line was announced we knew the point of the film, but it was all about how they told the story.
In the end we get a film of 2 hours 13 minutes and to me they couldn't of dispensed with any of that time in order to do it properly. The pacing is great and the film builds and builds to the fantastic climax which shows the director knows a bit about the elements which make Star Wars films so great. Not that it's not evident in the whole film, but that climax is outstanding, with snappy editing so we go through swooping fighters in space, to gritty battles on the ground. Some people have likened it to a war film, going from battle to battle and I can see what they mean for sure.
I don't agree with people saying the middle bit is hard going, and not sure why people sometimes just say things for the sake of saying something when reviewing films. I suppose there are bits which don't match up to the rest of the film but films need those bits for the overall story. All the best films in history have suffered the same.
I won't go into detailed views of the cast and performances but a shout out to the portrayal of K-2SO by Alan Tudyk. A classic Star Wars robot character. Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe is also excellent, and Ben Mendelsohn plays a nasty Krennic well. Also a mention about the score. Not John Williams this time but Michael Giacchino's music is brilliant and every now and then pulls in some of those classic themes from the old movies.
During that final 30 minutes the emotions were stirring inside of me. Some tears and a few deep intakes of breathe. Then I realized that on each viewing i had been pulled in the same way each time and it takes a good film to stir the emotions two more times when you know what's going to happen. It's at that point that i decided i needed to review it, and i hope this makes many more people want to see it. Don't go in expecting it to be up there with your favorite film of the other seven, but give it a chance.""When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was going to be bad but fun. I was surprised at how good it was but it had a few flaws.
First of all, this movie is extremely well made. Recently, I noticed kids movies were going down in quality. What I mean is that they are more badly filmed these days. This movie is extremely well directed. There's no shaky cam or badly filmed scenes.When you go see a movie that got 4.2/10, you expect the scenes to be badly filmed but no. It's very solidly filmed, even the action scenes. This makes for an entertaining movie.
The action scenes are pretty good in this movie. There are two main scenes and they are extremely well filmed. When I saw the reviews from this movie, I knew right away not to believe them because I know Chris Wedge is a good director and he did well with these action sequences. This is the guy that made Epic and Ice Age. He's very good.
The story is alright but you couldn't really expect it to be super complex. It's a movie about driving monster trucks. Enough said. That being said, it may be simple but it holds up well with the good directing. The critics will say what they will but no one could expect a complex movie from this. It's nothing new but it works well.
The acting wasn't that good. I thought that Lucas Till would be better. Jane Levy was not bad and the bad guy was menacing enough. Something that I found weird in this movie is that they accidentally murder people and it's okay. There's a scene where Tripp's truck jumps onto another one and it gets crushed and goes sliding 20 feet and everyone just goes off as if nothing happened even though that guy is clearly dead.
While not groundbreaking, Monster Trucks holds up quite well. It's very well directed and has good action scenes. This makes for an entertaining movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""3 Tours in Iraq and No Bailout for People Like Us."" These words, spray painted along the side of a stained brick wall, tell the audience who the villain of Hell or High Water is and where the motivation for two brothers to tear through West Texas towns that are all but deserted. Boarded up storefronts, abandoned gas stations, debt relief and fast cash signs peppered with bullets, sand blasted homes for sale; the vast and sepia toned landscape that is West Texas seems all but abandoned save for these two outlaws, the lawmen that chase them, and the citizens who are protecting whatever they have left.
Hell or High Water tells the tale of Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster, respectively), two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree across the plains of West Texas to save their family's land from being seized by the very banks they are robbing. The lawmen charged with hunting the Howard brothers down are a pair of Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Chris Pine's Toby Howard takes no joy in the path he's chosen in this time of desperation. It's a choice he struggles with and feels guilty for up until the final moments of the film, but the position he's in doesn't provide an easy out to his problems. With the burden of providing for his family and keeping his brother Tanner from going off the reservation, Toby understands that if he falls apart so does the plan to ensure his families safety. Even if it means sacrificing his own. Ben Foster shines as Tanner Howard, the unstable wild card to Chris Pine's careful but calculating Toby. Foster has always excelled as a character actor and his portrayal of the life long West Texas cowboy convict is done so with excellent emotional range and comedic wit that steals the movie away from his little brother, the just as voracious yet clichéd character of Marcus Hamilton that Jeff Bridges plays, and the emotionally grounded punching bag that is Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker.
The biggest success of the film comes from the comedic back and forth between the competing duos; it provides some much needed levity as you are beaten over the head with the environmental and orchestral storytelling of how desperate the wild plains of West Texas have become in a post-recession world. Foster and Pine's big brother/little brother relationship is believable and relatable through excellent shared storytelling and good natured ribbing. On the right side of the law, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham provide the perfect yang to the bank robbing brothers yin; their particular brand of good natured ribbing is steeped in Marcus's desire to stay attached to the life he's about to retire from and Alberto's desire to show respect to this ranger that he doesn't feel comfortable with but respects and needs to finish this job. Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Sons of Anarchy) figured out how to weave comedy back into an old west style cop & robbers film that takes place in modern day. The banter in Hell or High Water provides the audience with a movie that feels like something old given new life.
The characters on screen entice the audience to not take a side, to root for good to triumph over evil and for evil to escape the good. Similar to playing cops & robbers when you were a kid, the audience can easily switch sides after the first act, the second, and the third. To walk away from the experience understanding and appreciating the effort of the filmmakers to make you feel satisfied with the outcome, regardless of who your favorite was.
The film also takes care to make the Howard Brothers into West Texas Robin Hoods; a point made clear halfway through the film when the attorney handling the money the brothers steal stating ""to see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money? Well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is."" Even Alberto, the half-Native American, half-Mexican ranger points out to Marcus at one point, while the pair stake out a bank, that ""a long time ago your ancestors was the Indians. Until someone came along and killed em. Broke em down, made you into one of them. 150 years ago, all this was my ancestors land. Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday. Til' the grandparents of these folks took it. And now its been taken from them. Except it ain't no army doing it. It's those sons of bitches right there"" as he points to the very bank they are protecting.
That's the charm of Hell or High Water. The moments of contemplating the right and wrong of the two outlaw brothers actions. Two other examples of this occur early on in the film; a working mom name Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon) protects the handsome stranger who gave her a $200 tip that's half her mortgage while at the same an old timer (Paul Howard Smith) is trying to make sense of the actions of these outlaws. ""Seems foolish, days of robbing banks, trying to live and spend the money? Long gone, long gone for sure."" In this film, it's back to basics. Two men, two guns, some getaway cars, and a simple plan.
It's that back to basics approach, along with a fantastic original score and soundtrack provided by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, that keeps the tension level high for the entire 102 minutes of the film.
Hell or High Water is a thrilling, western crime story about the desperation of the outlaws to save what's theirs and the duty bound lawmen trying to hunt them down. For all the ambiguity and slow pacing of the story, the film ends with a clear winner and loser and leaves you wanting another old west tale.""This movie will give words to your grief. It will open you up, lay you bare, and take out that little pack of grief inside you, hold it up against light and show you how it looks from up close. What its made of. What is its texture. It will give a name to your feelings, a face to your emotions. Give yourselves this movie's insight.
What NOT to assume about the movie: Do not take this movie by its name. Or its trailer. This is not a kids' movie. Its a child's story. Do not take it as an attempt at a tear jerker. Do not take it as a run-of-the-mill art movie. Do not take it as anything you have seen before. It WILL shake you. Your insides. Your core.
Your hands will not move to fast forward once, even when there is no action and no flashy fight scenes. Beware, in the era of more visuals than substance, your ears will surprisingly listen. Your eyes will watch. You will want to know what happens, and how, even when you know it.
The emotions are the most red form of raw. They have been wrenched apart from real life and placed in front of the camera as they were. The actors, for this brilliance, deserve a thank you beyond the scope of my expression.
This movie holds a different meaning for everyone. If you have never felt personal grief, it will shock you by what its like when the stakes are high. If you have personally suffered, you will find yourself saying 'oh this is so true.this is how it was.'
Thats how it was for me, who has lost dear ones personally, and my husband, who hasn't. When Conor's truth was revealed, my husband gasped 'how could he?' while I smiled painfully, understanding exactly what Conor meant. These reactions were simultaneous and worlds apart, while we were watching the same movie at the same time.
Watch it. In a world of fantastic beasts and assassin's creeds, give your soul a chance. Do not deny yourself this child's story.""""A boy seeks the help of a tree monster to cope with his single mother's terminal illness."" This film was horribly advertised and there was hardly any mention of it at all under any circumstances. You really have to go searching for this monster, and when you do it looks like a little kids Fantasy Movie, and its not even the case! This movie is the best way to describe what goes through a child's mind when he has to deal with something like this. The child while losing his only mother/father tends to go into Fantasy Land to try and pretend that this isn't real. Instead of doing the typical escape into fantasy land where no one can hear/see you the Monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) is there to help the boy to face reality and to get him though all of this.
The acting was top notch, the directing was brilliant, the effects were great, and the finale 20 mins is just heartbreaking. It made us cry, and it's hard to make Autistic cry...trust us! But it's not really a film for kids, it's a film for adults. It's one of the most saddest movies we've seen in a while. It pulls at your heartstrings and it knew just when to do it.
Really, really amazing film and just what happens when your child is going through a horrible stage like this. The Autistic Reviewers give this 5/5 stars, 10/10. Check us out on facebook!""This is the Thing. If you ever loved a B movie --for the right reasons-- this is the Golden Glove. If you like They Live, if you like Robocop, Machete... you may have a new favorite. Not only is it freakishly on point for the new Trump epoch, it also has a very elusive ingredient for B-movies : Intelligent writing!
Now keep in mind the film is satirizing a culture of stupidity, violence, and greed, so you have to look closely for the intelligence hiding behind the explosions and vulgarity, but it's there, sometimes winking at you from behind a flaming haystack.
It's the abundance and timing of the jokes, both subtle and sometimes deliciously brutal, that should warrant a justified cult following for this jam.
What's that? You didn't come to this movie for jokes? For sly throwaway gags about a dystopian future? No problem. There are so many other movies where big men drive cars that go fast. Please watch one of them instead if that is your thing. Leave this rare movie for me and my people. We need it.""I must admit I was hesitant to watch this movie because numbers are my biggest weakness! I am a math moron and I was a bit worried that I might miss something in the translation from numbers to feelings. I needn't have worried! What a spectacular film about the triumph of brains in the face of ignorance! All three actresses Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe turn in flawless performances that made me laugh, cry and cheer at the sheer force of will these ladies exhibit. The frustration and hurt were palpable throughout the film and made me want to jump in the screen and teach some manners to several ignoramus' portrayed here! Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons round out the cast with stellar performances of their own. I will say, I am appalled and disappointed that before this movie, I had never heard of any of the three brilliant real life women portrayed in this film. That is unacceptable in a world where tiny every day tasks are glorified as life achievements! I hope this film swings wide the door to educate us all on the spectacular contributions that minorities have achieved, in spite of the road blocks they continually face. Incredible Movie! Must see!""I don't know why people think this is so bad. You have to remember it is aimed at kids, but it is reminiscent of Free Willy and the Loch Ness Monster films that are similar. It is cute and endearing with a sweet message. It has a fun plot with a lot of laughs, a cute monster and some action and adventure. It is lighthearted and easy to watch.
It is not going to win any awards but the acting and CGI are all pretty decent, as is the script ! I think this is a great watch if you want to go and see a lighthearted comedy or a movie with the kids. It is strong enough to keep adults entertained as well !
The family of monsters are especially comical as they behave like big slimy dogs !""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Overall: It's a solid action movie and one of the better Ben Affleck movies of 2016. It's worth a watch if you just want a good time.
Good: Ben Affleck is just incredible in his role of Christian Wolff and his was portrayal of autism was very well done and not overly done and over bloated like it's displayed in movies these days. In addition to this, the character of Christian Wolff was very cool and interesting. You wanted to know about him. The premise is quite strange but works quite well in my opinion. The action scenes are excellent and very well choreographed. The cinematography was pretty darn good and the music was probably non-existent(I didn't notice any). There were a few scenes which made me laugh. I hope this was intentional so I don't go to hell but I laughed regardless. Easily one of Affleck's best movies of 2016.
Bad: There is a moment in the movie where a minor character takes a 3-4 minute break to dump exposition on the audience so we knew what was going down in the finale. We needed to know this information but how it was handled felt very amateur and badly done. The story was pretty uninteresting and could have been written better. You have a pretty decent premise so all they had to do what use a little more imagination and give it a much better story. The 'twist' ending, which I shall not spoil, had little to no build up and didn't affect me at all. It was just there to 'spice' things up. The villains are boring and uninteresting and just plain generic. Also, up until the last 30 minutes, it was essentially just a dot-to-dot of events with no real method to them.
Best Part: The siege on the villain's fortress
MVP: Ben Affleck as Christian Wolff
8/10""The movie is excellent, from the awesome and unforgettable casting, to the twists and turns, to the places, to the depth of development in character and also to the best one-liners in movie history.
This made for solid and powerful performances we will never forget.
This is the best superhero movie of all time for some reason.
i recommend watching the entire trilogy, but this one you will be amazed by everything.
Watch this one and you feel that Nolan is not just one of the greatest directors to put an awesome flick, but also to make us question life as all an wonderful experience.""One of the best movies I've ever watched. It's a great story about finding yourself and following your dreams plus it's female-centered without hetero-normative love interests. I mean, she doesn't even have a love interest and I think it shows kids that women don't need romance to be happy. It's very important that we have feminist movies on the big screen 'cause it's a way of influencing people in a positive way. And by 'feminist' I mean it's not chauvinist or oppressive. To parents who care about their kids education, go watch this with them. By the way, this is a movie for everybody not just kids. And the soundtrack is amazing. You will surely be singing it for the whole week.""Former Special Forces Operative Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) takes part in a rogue experiment which on the flip side gives him the ability to heal rapidly, but on the downside this experiment leaves with permanent and unsightly scarring to his entire body. When Wilson is left for dead by Ajax (Ed Skrein) after the experiment has been completed, Wilson makes it his mission to gain revenge on Ajax and becomes Deadpool - Wilson's masked alter-ego.
Within the first few minutes of this film I had an inkling that I was going to like it. The opening credits are amusing and quite imaginative; I particularly loved the Directed By 'An Overpaid Tool' caption.
The opening segment of the film where we're introduced to Deadpool - the fast-talking crazed anti-hero are probably some of the best moments in the film and Reynolds is clearly at his best in this film when he becomes Deadpool. I have to be honest and admit that I did find it a bit jarring when the film cuts to the 'origin story' which ultimately took on a much more serious tone. This isn't a bad thing as the 'origin story' was interesting enough, but I still found it a bit of a shock to my system at first due to how impressive and explosive the opening few minutes of the film were.
The story itself is rather weak and in some ways it seems ironic that the film spends so much time sending itself up and making fun of itself only to then have a rather clichéd and predictable plot line and outcome. The turn of events in the final third aren't bad and there are still plenty of amusing moments, but given the fact that it seemed to have some imagination to it I just expected a bit more that's all.
Another slight problem with this film lies with Wade Wilson; although he is an anti-hero when he becomes Deadpool he is also an anti-hero when he is Wade Wilson himself. The problem is that before he becomes Deadpool he isn't a particularly likable person and I did feel that sometimes he got what he deserved. This, in some ways, made him a rather unlikeable character (pre-accident) meaning that it was harder to get behind him when he became his alter-ego. I personally feel that a good anti-hero should have some likability or a reason to root for them in order to be successful and I never really felt that way about Deadpool or Wade Wilson, but like I said the sense of fun that the film brings means that these things don't cause that much of a problem.
That being said though, when Reynolds is Deadpool this film never lets up and is an absolute blast to watch. The sending up and parodying that it offers is imaginative and very funny. The fourth wall stuff is pretty amusing - although it does get a bit repetitive. If you liked Kick-Ass then I think that this film will be right up your street. Therefore despite a thin story and a rather flawed protagonist, this film is funny, imaginative and self-aware enough to more than compensate for its very minor shortcomings and is something that I would highly recommend.""It's a good movie. It proves you don't need a unique story to make a nice movie. If you have a good director and good actors like SRK & Nawazuddin, you can still pull off a good Bollywood film which has all elements, action, romance, thrill & drama in it. Songs could have been reduced but still it's not that bad as story keeps moving with songs and are not too lengthy too. It is a fast paced movie which doesn't drag away from the main topic and keeps the battle between the cop & a bootlegger on. All actors have done justice to their roles. Not to mention SRK & Nawazuddin nailed it to perfection as RAEES & Majmudar. Go for it. It's definitely worth a watch.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Two-time Oscar-winning writer & director Ben Affleck of ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Argo"" has helmed an above-average, old-fashioned, Prohibition Era gangster epic ""Live by Night"" with himself as star that bears greater resemblance to Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984) with Robert De Niro than Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) with Marlon Brando. At the same time, Affleck has tampered with the violent, empire-building gangster film formula. Mind you, ""Live by Night"" isn't strictly traditional in its depiction of gangsters. Instead of machine gun massacres in the urban canyons of a northern metropolis, ""Live by Night"" stages machine gun massacres at luxury resort hotels amid the scenic splendor of rural southern Florida. Like the antihero that Affleck portrays with considerable style, charm, and restraint, ""Live by Night"" doesn't abide by all gangster movie rules, particularly the tragic ending. Nevertheless, crime still doesn't pay for the protagonist. As in most gangster movies, the mobsters count on avarice, treachery, blackmail, and betrayal to achieve their infamy. Affleck's armed and dangerous anti-hero, however, displays neither the aggressive pugnacity of Edward G. Robinson in ""Little Caesar"" (1931) nor does he behave like James Cagney's trigger-happy hoodlum in ""The Public Enemy"" (1931.) Instead, he imitates Robert De Niro's Jewish gangster David 'Noodles' Aaronson in the Leone masterpiece. Affleck's Irish-American hooligan Joe Coughlin knows when to say 'no' and abandon the business before his rivals riddle him with bullets to kingdom come. My only complaintand it constitutes more of a quibbleis the 2 hours plus running time. This chronicle about a self-proclaimed 'outlaw' who ascends from the ranks of blue-collar, unaffiliated thieves and emerges as the white-collar chieftain of a mob-supervised, multi-million-dollar enterprise doesn't exactly lunge off the screen. Affleck allows things to develop gradually and steeps the logistics of crime in atmosphere galore as well as memorable characters. Strong villains make the best movies with their notorious skulduggery. Faithfully adapting the second novel in Dennis Lahane's Coughlin series, Affleck tangles with three unforgettable dastards.
The son of an incorruptible Boston Police Deputy Superintendent, Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck of ""The Town"") refuses to accommodate his father, Thomas Coughlin (Brendan Gleeson of ""Gangs of New York""), when it comes to being a law-abiding citizen. Joe survived the devastating trench warfare of World War I in France as a U.S. Marine while men around him perished by the dozens on the battlefield. He has come home to Boston with nothing but utter contempt for the politicians who sold out the troops at the international treaty negotiation. Joe vows never to take orders again. Things don't pan out exactly as our hero had anticipated. Initially, Joe and two masked accomplices knock over an illegal, high-stakes poker game with a paid-off insider, Emma Gould (Sienna Miller of ""American Sniper""), who knows her way around Boston. Eventually, one of Boston's most notorious gangsters, Albert White (Robert Glenister of ""Safe Conduct""), learns that Joe has been raiding his venues. White insists that our protagonist join his gang and use his skills for something more appropriate to his talents. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the jealous White, Joe has been sneaking around behind White's back with his mistress Emma. Mafia crime boss Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone of ""Angel with a Gun"") summons Joe and asks him to kill White. Adamantly, Joe refuses to attach himself to the Italians. Maso threatens to inform on Joe if he doesn't eliminate White. Meantime, Joe plans a big bank robbery so Emma and he can flee to California with some capital. The robbery goes sideways. Three policemen die trying to nab Joe and his accomplices. Eventually, White catches up with Joe after Emma betrays him. White brutally beats Joe up. He is poised to finish him off when Thomas Coughlin rolls up with the Boston Police in tow. Thomas arrests Joe, but he convinces a harsh judge prosecute his son on lesser charges since Joe's accomplices killed the cops. Furthermore, Thomas informs Joe that Emma died when her getaway car plunged into the river. Joe sweats out forty months behind bars in the Charlestown State Prison. After his release, Joe offers to work for the Pescatore family, and Maso dispatches him to Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, to handle their rum-running enterprise. No sooner has Joe set up shop than the evil White dispatches not only his own henchmen but also hooded KKK gunmen to make life miserable for our hero. Joe creates an enormously profitable operation for Maso. Nevertheless, he doesn't abandon his yearning to wreck vengeance on White for what he did not only to him but also Emma.
""Foxcatcher"" production designer Jess Gonchor, ""Tree of Life"" costume designer Jacqueline West, and ""Forrest Gump"" set decorator Nancy Haigh has painstakingly recreated both the glory and the squalor of the Prohibition Era. The gangsters attire themselves lavishly in posh suits with fedora-style hats, while their dames doll themselves up with equal magnificence. The gangsters cruise around in vintage cars of the period, and their henchmen wield that indispensable weapon of the day: the .45-caliber, Thompson submachine gun with drum magazines rather than stick magazines. Indeed, Affleck has preserved virtually all the elements of the classic gangster movie during the Depression about illegal rum-runners. After fate cheats Joe with Emma's sudden death, he gets involved romantically with a gorgeous Cuban lady, Graciela Suarez (Zoe Saldana of ""Star Trek Beyond""), who participates in the business of selling illegal rum with her brother. ""Live by Night"" doesn't dwell only on the gangsters and their illicit business, but also in the lives of the supporting characters, particularly a young woman (Elle Fanning) who suffered from the adversity of heroin addiction and later becomes an evangelist to protest vice of any kind. The cast is superb, and nobody gives a bad performance. Despite its leisurely, slow-burn pace, ""Live by Night"" manages to present the exploits of gangsters in a setting and manner that few gangster movies have, especially with its lukewarm finale.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This film opened my eyes. Will Smith is one of the most talented actors I have ever seen and he played the role of a grief-stricken father magnificently. My heart broke when his honesty about heartache showed. Somehow just simply writing a letter and receiving a response and become more than an outdated action. This filmed provided answers to questions I hadn't even thought to ask. Complete with plot twists and empowering messages, this isn't a film to miss. While I am bias to any film that Smith acts in, you have to really see it for yourself. I don't cry much in films and this didn't change that for me, but I felt a build-up of emotion that was exciting to experience. See it for yourself, if you don't want to spend $12 on a film you may or may not like, then wait until it comes out in the local video store (if those are still available), it's worth checking out for yourself. This film invites many different perspectives and no matter what the writers and the rest of the cast should be proud of their work.""It is rare for a film two spawn two distinctly different emotions; fear and wonder. In Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"", these two defining emotions work in conjunction, creating an awe-inspiring feeling for this visual masterpiece.
Almost 50 years later, this film remains unsurpassed in terms of visual brilliance; as the films clarity and beauty is greatly;y renowned. More importantly, it's majestic and tragic portrayal of mankind is more relevant than ever, as the day in which interstellar will be available draws nearer.
In the end, this beautiful tale serves as a historic mirror, one that reflects the ideology present in now an age past, and also serves as an insight into what awaits us in the future.""I love this movie. It covers all the emotions, fears, and uncertainties in this world. I Quote: it often. :)
My favorite comedic character is toot, for his silly ramblings. I also like Billy the Kid has a lot of funny lines too.
The Green Mile is also the only film that I think that David Morse ( who plays Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell) comes out looking so sexy. He looks ugly in all the other films I have seen him in.
Tom Hanks is the best actor ever. Anytime I see him in a film, I see a knew person and forget all of the other roles that he has ever played. He is AMAZING!!!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Darius Stone, a new agent in the XXX program, is sent to Washington, DC to defuse a power struggle amongst national leaders. Although Vin Diesel doesn't return for the sequel his replacement Mr. Ice Cube actually surprised me a lot, Willem Dafoe, Samuel L. Jackson and Scott Speedman were actually good and overall this isn't as bad as i thought it was it's actually a pretty good decent action movie and i think that it had way more action than the first but i still like Xander Cage more than Darius Stone. Guys in the end XXX: State of the Union is not a masterpiece but it's not a horrible movie either it does have some pretty bad cgi here and there and some over the top moments but it's an action movie so what did you expect? So just buy lots of pop corn and enjoy this movie for what it is.""Disney and Poppins were part of my childhood, to be sure. Doesn't mean I want to go back there, but this was a pleasant excursion. Thompson and Hanks are perfect as the leads. Interesting that two characters who, these days, garner mixed reviews are so sympathetically rendered, but in a real way. At the centre of this, Mary Poppins is retold from the perspectives of its creator, the scriptwriters and musicians who had to work with her (tough work) and Disney himself. Real life, real and imagined pasts and the world of Poppins are successfully intertwined. Ultimately, this is a film which knows what film-making is about, communicating a real story in a creative, entertaining and ultimately moving way.""I remember back in the day I used to regularly encounter Tony Wilson via the pages of the music weeklies such as Melody Maker. On that basis, I always used to think he was a bit of an annoying, attention-seeking idiot. Well, I have to admit that this highly negative viewpoint was swept away completely once I saw 24 Hour Party People. This film made me realise, that far from being an annoyance, Wilson was a pretty overwhelmingly positive force for good as far as the British music scene went. TV journalist, record mogul, nightclub owner, he was a man of many colours and one with obvious contradictions  while he was a bit pompous, he was very good-intentioned and while he was something of a musical visionary, he was terrible at long-term planning. What's abundantly clear though, is that he was most certainly not out for personal financial gain through his ventures; his idea of allowing the bands to come and go as they pleased with no ownership attributed to his record company was very worthy and in true artistic spirit but it was also, needless to say, ultimately catastrophic. Despite doing very well for himself, Wilson seems to have been a really terrible businessman. And this is yet another reason to love the guy.
The film charts the Manchester music scene from the mid 70's post-punk scene to late 80's Madchester period. It centres on Wilson's Factory Records who had many key Manchester acts on their label, including seminal bands such as Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays. Perhaps just as importantly, Factory also owned the Hacienda nightclub which would go on to become a place majorly associated with the rise of DJ culture and dance music. There is no doubting the importance of the Manchester music scene at the turn of the 90's and this film shows that Wilson was a huge figure in its genesis, one whose hands-off approach allowed for the music on his label to flower in the best way.
Michael Winterbottom directs this with great skill. The loose approach matches the music. It's fast-paced and regularly laugh-out-loud funny. A big help here is the outstanding performance from brilliant comic actor Steve Coogan in the role of Wilson. He often breaks the fourth wall to offer valuable asides to us and generally gives out a performance that deftly combines comedy and drama expertly. There are a variety of other real characters portrayed here including Ian Curtis, Shaun Ryder and Martin Hannett; and no one lets the side down. And then of course there is a ready-made soundtrack of great tunes in which events play out in front of, from the post-punk iciness of Joy Division through to the baggy hedonism of the Happy Mondays. All of this adds up to a music biopic of a very high level indeed. Wilson was a man who definitely deserved his achievements to be celebrated in a film which is this inspiring, entertaining and hilarious.""This version of ""The Bounty"" story was one of David Lean's unrealized projects. The screenplay was by Lean's longtime collaborator Robert Bolt and it finally reached the screen under the direction of Roger Donaldson who actually does a very good job. This takes a different slant on the usual take on the mutiny making Bligh, (an excellent Anthony Hopkins), if not exactly the hero, considerably less of a villain than he is usually painted while Christian, (Mel Gibson), is weak and dissolute with his own, selfish motives for rebelling. There is also a much greater emphasis on the events after the mutiny than in previous pictures.
It may lack the physical excitement of the Frank Lloyd version but it's definitely an improvement on the elephantine Brando/Howard remake. The large cast includes early performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson as well as Edward Fox and Laurence Olivier as officers presiding at Bligh's court-martial and there's a terrific performance from the New Zealand actor Wi Kuki Kaa as King Tynah. Like all good yarns this has stood the test of time remarkably well.""Pk is one of the best Bollywood movies of 2014. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani and written by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi, it stars Aamir khan, Anushka Sharma, Boman Irani,Sushant Singh Rajput,Sanjay Dut and Saurabh Shukla.
It's a satire on religious dogmas and superstitions. In short it is an-Indian satirical science fiction comedy film. It is also the highest grossing Hindi movie of all time.
Mr Khan has given performance of his life. He carries the film all the way. Anuskha Sharma is also excellent in her role as Jagat Janani. The music of the film is excellent. My overall score for the movie. 9/10""Not just any World War II film or dramatization of Nazis, ""Downfall"" gets up close and personal with the Third Reich and its key members, recounting Adolf Hitler's final days in a Berlin bunker as Soviet troops besieged the city.
No one has had to play Hitler in quite the way ""Downfall"" requires of Bruno Ganz. This is not a good vs. evil, Axis and Allies WWII epic that reminds us all of the wickedness of Nazism and the great tragedy of the Holocaust. Screenwriter Bernd Eichinger wants to  with as much historical accuracy as possible  explore the Fuhrer behind the facade, the megalomaniacal idealist as he's confronted with his inevitable failure. With Oliver Hirschbiegel's stark direction and Ganz's multi-faceted performance, ""Downfall"" strips away the legend of Hitler and other high-ranking Nazis and provides a grim, pitiful portrait of a movement's dying breaths.
In addition to a book compiled by historian Joachim Fest, the story comes from the accounts of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary from 1942 through his death, who survived following the Nazis' surrender. Hirschbiegel actually bookends the film with testimonial footage of the real Junge reflecting on being young and naive, and how she played ignorant and absolved herself of any guilt at the time and now has trouble forgiving herself.
Junge's character (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) is the closest thing the film has to a protagonist, yet the film isn't presented entirely from her perspective. The story features an extensive list of characters, from notable names like Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) to an array of military officers, doctors, children and volunteer fighters and more. It actually starts to get extremely confusing, but Eichinger was clearly determined not to exclude any one person or type of person, and the payoff comes in the form of the various ways these many characters responded to knowing the end was coming, which presents us with an array of fascinating psychological case studies.
Most fascinating of them all, of course is Hitler, who the film depicts as making careful preparations for his suicide knowing it was only a matter of time, but who refused to surrender and continued to bark military orders as if confident that a the final victory was still achievable. Ganz's performance has hints of the fiery orator most people are familiar with, but also a sensitivity and a sadness as he realizes just how many of his people have betrayed him by giving up and that was his failure. That's not to say Ganz or ""Downfall"" humanize Hitler to the extent that we actually feel sorry for him, but even those who believe so ardently in an evil ideology must confront failures, their legacy and death.
Hitler also knew he had lost, and the film portrays him of being at peace with it, so what's more chilling is the way others respond, those who were naive, those who went along with Nazism out of cowardice, and those who became so swept up in Nazi dogma that they couldn't toss it away in the face of objective truth and logic. Maybe more fascinating than Hitler's perspective is that of the prominent Nazi women in the film, Hitler's longtime partner Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) and Maegda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch). Both women remain loyal in spite of their fate, but handle the waning moments different. Maegda's decision to bring her six children into the bunker, for one, has a particularly harrowing effect on the film.
""Downfall"" doesn't have the cinematic qualities of most WWII films. In fact, it might be better suited as a play with its limited set and variety of scenes featuring conversations between a host of different characters. The constant shelling of Berlin throughout the entire film provides ample context for the drama underground that the story doesn't need most of the outdoor ""action"" sequences.
That said, Hirschbiegel does not glorify war or violence; his film portrays both rather matter-of-factly. In fact, he's a little inconsistent in how he uses blood and gore  the amount of it varies from scene to scene, but the amount of death in the film is staggering and a profound component of the experience of the film. ""Downfall"" kind of presents everything at face value, a rather critical decision considering the highly sensitive nature of the story and its characters.
Every WWII film, especially one about Nazism and the Holocaust, must have a niche and unique perspective considering how often filmmakers dip into its well of stories. Yet they do it because humanity will never quite understand how the Nazis were able to take power and how the Holocaust was allowed to happen. ""Downfall,"" as difficult a viewing experience as it is, unquestionably fills in one part of the picture of one of history's darkest chapters, a section that could've easily gone unpainted.

Night Shyamalan's masterpiece mystery delivers haunts and a brilliant twist that launched him into the mainstream. The story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) and his child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) take a spooky turn as Cole's secret is revealed. The movie begins with Dr. Crowe celebrating with his wife over an award for his work with children. A former patient with continuing difficulties breaks in and shoots Crowe before killing himself.
The failure of this patient sparks Crowe's interest in young Cole as they suffer from similar ailments. Cole is believed to be schizophrenic as he is often seen talking to himself and surround by other weird patterns of behavior. He also has trouble in school and appears to obtain knowledge that should otherwise be a secret. These problems result in him being isolated and having to pay a fellow student Tommy (Trevor Morgan) to be his friend.

Based on a true story about an Irish peacekeeping mission in the Congo under the UN flag in the early 60's where the military is hung out to dry. A time where the UN was focused on legitimacy while the world was focused on the cold war.
Solid acting, good script, reasonable cinematography. This is not a high budget thriller, or, thankfully Hollywood propaganda, hype or horse----, but a reasonable telling of a true and fascinating story that encourages you to read the full facts on what actually happened.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** An intelligent odyssey for a spiritual world, we have to be careful when talking about ""The others"" because any comma may ruin the whole experience of the film, what happened to me, even receiving a spoiler, the film's mood was compromised, but Even so the ending surprises. As the sixth sense (99) or the island of fear (I0), ""The Others"" is worthy of its end, with a regular performance of bipolar Nicole Kidman the highlight is for the children's actors, and also for the director of photography that brings a Climate that contrasts with the strong bright light of the sun with complete darkness passing through all the color palettes. With an honest script, that does not try to pass the leg, but knew how to make the catch with the viewer, Alejandro Amenábar does a good job, because the complete work of the film makes him intelligent and intriguing, although he creates several subplots, and does not explain any And with several repetitions of ideas that do not compromise the experience of the film, Alejandro Amenábar uses the soundtrack the way one has to use in a horror film, high, sharp and uncomfortable. ""The Others"" is a good suspense movie, tries to take advantage of a climate already seen in several other films, and an end that became fashionable in the 90s, but even so, it has many merits, and in a way, still surprises .""I found this movie on the free movie service Tubi TV, looking for something to watch/listen to while I did paperwork and pay bills. I was expecting a dud, but wow, what a nice film!
The entire movie takes place in a the title character's living room (John), as he's preparing to move away after ""retiring"" from his university teaching position after 10 years on staff. A group of his colleagues drop by unexpectedly to say goodbye, and John regales them with a story that he allegedly has never shared in his long, most peculiar life.
I would normally find this kind of single-scene movie quite laborious, I found myself quite engaged in the story and the characters. At the end, I felt a little let down because I wanted to know more about John, I wanted the story-telling to go on. It felt almost like a prologue to a much larger and more epic story. Nevertheless, it did seem to stand on its own and I'm glad I watched it. Maybe not a movie for an exciting movie-night, but certainly worth it for a quite afternoon or even date-night.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I saw this film yesterday, and I'll be honest I cried like a little b*h (I'm 20 something guy) while watching it and tears rolled up my eyes even when I saw just the stills from this film. No doubt, this is very sad and touching film about war and it really made me think about for some time. But the longer I thought about it, more flaws started coming up.
First of all, the story. I don't mind that's it is really plain, it did what it had to do: it made me care. But for the problems and the conflicts in main characters lives are quite solvable. The aunt did get mad at them, and there was valid reason for it. The boy could go find a job and help her aunt out, but he didn't. Maybe he didn't want to leave his sister and that's why he didn't get a job, but later in the film, he constantly leaves her in their new ""home"".
Then there's issue with famine and malnutrition.Their mom left some money, so I don't really understand why they didn't spend it on food. Maybe the brother wanted to save money for something else, but when you and your sister are dying of hunger right now, there are no valid reason not to spend it on food now. Basically the problems of main characters could be solved, if brother had swallowed his pride, went back to aunt, apologized, found a job and they would have lived happily ever after.
Secondly, the montage that pulls the heart strings and makes most people cry: when we see the little sister on the swing, eating mud and playing around their home. Well, there is no other reason for that montage to be there, than to manipulate with audience's feelings. Why are we seeing this? Are these memories? Whose memories? From whose point of view are we seeing this? Neither brother or his soul is there to see it. And the scene where Setsuko is saluting with a pot on her head - that scene is made purely to play with our emotions and to feature on posters.
BTW, the creator of this film said, that it's not anti-war movie. It's original purpose was to show Japanese teenagers at the time (1988), what their parents went through and to teach children not to be so self-entitled little brats.
In conclusion: Grave of the Fireflies has beautiful animation, beautiful score, strong message but it lacks in character depth(lack of story arc) its story has logic flaws and it is purposefully designed to make us sad.
Grave of the Fireflies is a great animated film, but I don't think it can be called masterpiece""...And the story is so excellent it could have been a live action film Studio Ghibli at it's best and animation at it's best. how did the Oscars pass up on this for the win!? Plus I'm showing favoritism as the movie is about one of my favorite subjects, Aviation.
Somewhere in-between The Great War and World War II lies Jiro, a young Japanese man who becomes a fan of an Italian airplane designer and shares his dream (Literately in the sense of the movie) of designing air crafts, and the movie goes through his process, as well as him finding love.
I don't know if this is a true story or how inspired by true events the movie is, but the Zero fighter that Jiro designs was used by the Japanese in World War 2. I do know the title comes form a poem. The Wind Rises, what a perfect title for a movie about Aviation.
Anyway, The Wind Rises is like a painting in movement. the complete extension of what I want from animation. There was one scene in which Japan suffered an earthquake and with animation, they intensified the scene making it look like the ground just had a hiccup and caused all this chaos and destruction. it was brilliant.
So I'm sorry, as good as Frozen is I think the Oscars made the wrong choice in not given the Wind Rises the trophy.""This is one of those movies where you KNOW it isn't perfect... Did they HAVE to insert in an entirely redundant cute alien creature, for example? And wasn't the spaceship MUCH more appealing with a robotic, apathetic voice at the start then as the jive talking', clownish 'best buddy' that he becomes later? Yes, and YES.
But to a kid who grew up with this film, such imperfections don't matter a jot. You were THERE, flying through the sky, plunging into the ocean and almost crash landing into the Earth at the speed of light.
Even watching as a adult, the memories still linger... but the film is more than just a mildly pleasant nostalgia trip. Check out the cutting-edge special effects, and the excessively poignant meeting Kevin has with his family in the future where he hasn't aged a day.
Pure magic. 8/10""After many years, The Sixth Sense remains the film which gave M. Night Shyamalan his high praise and is considered by many to be his best film. The film bills itself as a psychological thriller, but it's really more of a supernatural adventure picture that will make you ponder and think about every little detail of your own life once after watching the film. Bruce Willis stars as a child psychologist trying to heal a young boy (Haley Joel Osment). The boy's affliction, he's always scared. And he has good reason to be.
After several close paying attention to detail, though this synopsis is quite brief, more said would mean fewer surprises. And this is one film sure to surprise you. Rather, let's turn our attention to the horror factor. This film is not a horror film in the least, as there are no slashing and no scary pop-up scenes. Instead, it's the relationship between the psychologist and the boy that aptly carries the picture, that and the subjects of the child's ""sixth sense.""
For one time viewers to watch this film as of 2017, it may feel as scary to those who have watched the film in its 1999 release date. Overall, the Sixth Sense plays great mind tricks but as a horror film, it is not. More so a mystery thriller with occasional jump scares (though are very brief)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Last night I saw Arrival at TIFF and my mind was blown. This is by far Villeneuve's biggest film he has tackled yet with so many strong universal themes but yet also feels very emotional and intimate from the perspective of Amy Adams's character. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. This movie is the best movie.
Louise is lecturing at a university; twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear across the planet. U.S. Army Colonel Weber asks her to join a team, with physicist Ian Donnelly, to decipher their language and find out why they have come to Earth. The team is brought to a U.S. military camp in Montana near one of the spacecraft. They call two alien which is nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols, and begins to learn the symbols that correspond to a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to see and dream vivid images of herself with her daughter.
When Louise is able to ask what the aliens want, they answer: ""offer weapon"". A similar translation ""use weapon"" is received by one of the other sites. Fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. However, Louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as ""weapon"" might have an alternative translation, such as ""tool"" or ""technology"".
Rogue soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. Unaware, Louise and Ian re-enter to communicate with Abbott and Costello again. The aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. Abbott ejects Ian and Louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious.
After Lan and Louise wake up, Ian works out that the symbols relate to the concept of time, and that it is one-twelfth of the whole ""gift""; they conclude that the aliens must want nations to cooperate.
Louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. She meets Costello, who communicates that Abbott is dying. Louise asks about her visions of a daughter, and Costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing to her that her ""visions"" were not flashbacks but flash forwards. Costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the ""weapon"" or ""tool"" because it changes the mind's perception of time. The aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. They ask her to use her ""weapon"" - her ability to see into the future.
Louise returns as the camp is being evacuated. Louise use her future power to know Shang's wife last words and she use to that to stop Shang's military power (China power). The planned Chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from Earth.
When packing to leave the camp, Ian admits his love for Louise. They discuss life choices, and whether they would change them if they knew the future. Louise foresees that Ian will father her daughter Hannah, whose name is an intentional palindrome, and leave her after discovering that she knew their daughter would die before adulthood. Despite also seeing that Ian will leave her when she eventually reveals their daughter's future, when Ian asks her if she wants to have a baby, Louise agrees.""THE HANDMAIDEN is a great film. It seems to glow with creativity and beauty with each new scene, and during the entirety of its over 2 hour run time I found myself entranced by a slow-churning mystery that left me once again excited by the craft a good movie can make appear so easy.
The film is a South Korean production helmed by director Chan-wook Park, known mostly in America as the director of 'Oldboy.' People often say that foreign films demonstrate a higher quality in comparison to the stuff of Hollywood; that stories are daring and the craft is not as pressured by executives who would rather turn a profit than make something truly substantial. Did they ever get it right.
The movie is a period piece that is lush in costumes and sets. Each new shot paints a picture on the screen that simply pulls one into the world of South Korea in the 1930's. The cinematography, a lush landscape of vibrant hues and meticulous staging, keeps us engaged as though by hypnotism. The story follows three people, each scheming in their own right, telling the audience information that might only be a passing thought in their mind. In the simplest form, the story is of a conman who hopes to rob a wealthy woman (Lady Hideko) of her inheritance by feigning love with her and posing as a Count. Once married, he will find her mentally unsound and throw her in a mental institution, leaving him to bask in a newfound fortune. In order to make the most of his plan, he sends a maid (another con artist named Sook-Hee) to infiltrate the Lady's home and gain information and insight into the mind of the woman.
The film opens with a scene of forgers and thieves who meet to hear the ""Count's"" plan. He runs a business of sorts, forging money, legal papers, and jewelry. He promises them a cut of the fortune assuming they can help pass himself off as a man of means. Sook- Hee, for her troubles, is promised $50,000 and a new wardrobe once Hideko is institutionalized. She is a simple girl, illiterate, but the prospects are insatiable.
In the night, she takes a car ride down the coastline to the estate of Lady Hideko, a grand estate built in two parts: one half designed as though an English mansion, and another half in traditional Japanese style. It's truly East meets West, and the blatant metaphor of clashing cultures and ideas only becomes more potent as the story progresses.
Lady Hideko lives on the estate with her elderly uncle, a man who uses an ink pen so fervently that his tongue is stained black. He is a collector of antique literature and texts which are entirely erotic in nature, and uses Hideko to recite the texts to potential buyers who frequent the mansion in hopes of bidding on what is essentially pornography. We learn about her past, raised by her Uncle in a disciplinarian manner, losing her aunt to a suicide as a child, and an eternal fear of ever leaving the confines of the estate. For Sook- Hee, the innocent maid come to spy on her, it might already seem like a mental institute is not too far off.
As these two women begin to know each other, they become friendly, with Hideko using Sook-Yee to model her clothes and confine dark secrets in the privacy of her room. Sook- Yee, who sees the potential wealth she will soon inherit, seems hypnotized by the beauty of her boss, and in some of the most beautiful moments of glances and gestures, we can see a dark romance forming between the two women.
The story is broken up into three parts, and to venture in even discussing the array of twists and turns would do no favors to the structure of the story, so expertly-written and brilliant that at any one time we may have flashbacks within flashbacks told simply to act as footnote to a line of dialogue or interpret the actions of a character. Never are we lost or in over our heads; this is a masterpiece of story and style. In fact, Part 2 nearly replays the entire first act of the film but through the perspective of an entirely different character. Scenes are repeated in their entirety and yet the insight we gain only leads towards understanding of the next moment, and the next...
The movie is based on an English crime novel called ""Fingersmith,"" and we can see how this story could easily be (at first glance) a serial crime novel with a predictable plot. The story is tense at times and deeply erotic at others, showing these two women in moments of ultimate vulnerability and strength, sometimes in the same instance. I would expect many audience members to be offput by the graphic nature of several scenes, and yet I can do nothing but praise the artistic endeavors to use sex on film as a means to tell an emotional story.
The Academy Awards have created a shortlist of potential nominees for Best Foreign Film, a list that does not include 'The Handmaiden' (South Korea instead nominated a film called 'The Age of Shadows'). It's a shame that a movie as wonderful as this could be looked over, even if by technicality that a country needs to pick one film only to represent it. The soundtrack is haunting, the story compelling, the look is heavenly. I know I will see many more films as the Fall rolls along, and yet I know that when I come to make a list of my favorite films of the year, this is now the one to beat.""This spellbinding trip through Berlin youth culture is a masterful achievement for the production team who filmed this all in one take. This ambitious technique didn't compromise the power of the visuals or the scale of the set. Despite my trained eye, the narrative was so strong that I wouldn't have noticed there weren't any cuts. Like Berlin's character itself, this effortless artistry symbolises two fingers up to the Hollywood blockbusters that need 100 takes to perfect just 1 second of film. The story follows a young woman who makes a series of decisions that go against the natural instinct of every other woman watching. When we would say no to a group of thugs in a dark side street, she says yes. This sets up the premise for the film as the story spirals more and more out of control. Through the development of a tender relationship between her and the male lead, the onion layers fall away and the audience can deduce why she is so reckless and self-destructive. It is this psychology that gives the story permission to escalate and become so separate from anything you or I would do. Don't watch the trailer, don't know anything about it before you watch it and you will be amazed.""Elem Klimov's final film is a devastating look at the horrors of war through the eyes of a teenage boy who joins the partisans in Belarus (then the Byelorussian SSR or White Russian SSR). Much like Mike Nichols's ""Catch-22"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Idi i smotri"" (""Come and See"" in English) makes you feel as if the war is hitting you directly. And this movie leaves little to the imagination in showing the Nazis' brutality. Probably the most famous scene is when the Nazis burn down a house. There's music playing the entire time to ensure that the noise doesn't stop. You have rarely seen something as intense as this on screen.
Klimov's wife Larisa Shepitko directed the equally intense movie ""The Ascent"", about some Soviet troops who try to defend a house from the Nazis (Shepitko got killed in a car wreck a few years later). The important thing to remember is that the Soviet Union lost almost 27 million people fighting the Nazis, more than any other country (it probably would've been more if the winter hadn't held the Nazis back). There's a reason why Russians still refer to the Great Patriotic War, as opposed to simply World War II. And this is one of the many movies that emphasize it. Definitely watch it.""I have read some of the reviews about this movie, regarding a remake of a Spanish movie, and no clue that this was a remake.
For a movie I haven't heard anything about, I gave it ago based on the actors in the movie.
Pleasantly surprised at the gripping, compelling storyline. The heartbreak and suspense, as well as the thriller aspect of the movie, with that forever twist that I search for in movies. As The usual Suspects being one of my ultimate favourite movies of all time, I found that the storyline flowed well, it wasn't drawn out to the point you get bored and want to switch to another movie. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend watching.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I give this film a 7.5, but without fractions I'd have to round it up to 8.
This is a big budget film, an $18m film, which in today's dollars is around $30m. Considering that production costs are lower in France, this film would cost much much more in the US. It looks expensive.
The costumes, sets and everything, look completely realistic, which is a big feat. Many productions making period pieces fall into cheap, Halloween-costume territory or incredibly pristine, clean and freshly-pressed cosplay-like costumes. It's easy to look like a clown, especially with costumes from that time, but they didn't. They look very real.
The fighting and murders look very convincing as well. It is not too gruesome, but quite long. I know that shorter versions of this film exist, but I don't say ""cut, cut, cut"" but montage. A faster-paced montage could've told us the scale of the murders without having to spend so much time showing each individual kill.
The music by Bregovic is brilliant. His adaptation of Balkan folk songs, Balkan rock, Serbo-Croatian, Gypsy and other influences and adapt them in a renaissance style gave this film a unique feeling and mood. I'm glad they didn't just take some standard renaissance music or make a soundtrack from Celtic and French music of the era.
The acting is very good, as is the story, but I was expecting more of an ending. I wish we had told in text that the prophecy had come true and that Catherine de Medici's sons bore no heirs, leaving the throne to Henri. This is a strange omission, especially since they had a scene specifically telling us of the prophecy.
I wish France, or anyone really, would make more films like this, but people want more Warcraft and less drama.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Anime has been a favorite of mine for years, starting with dubs of Pokémon and getting better from that point. I have known, similarly, that Akira was among the first popular anime films in North America and thus opened the way to dubs of Studio Ghibli films. However, I have been wondering if maybe an attempt was made earlier than 1988, all the way back to after this film's release in Japan. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, being the founding film of Studio Ghibli, is quite easily an S-tier movie. The characters are complexly developed and can deliver both eerie calmness (like Nausicaä herself) and blowout action (like the Commando). This is supplemented by the pristinely elaborate story, giving us a glimpse of the post-apocalypse with depictions that seem relevant in a time when stories like this would only be told by conspiracy theorists. The relative lack of music doesn't hinder the film at all and actually helps it in areas when it is trying to feel realistic or get its message across. To match this is the animation, which I am actually surprised took only 9 months to complete; its drawings of various large objects like the airships and especially the Ohmu seem like they took so much more time to animate so fluidly in 1984. All I can say is, you will miss much if you decide to pass this film, even in favor of other Studio Ghibli films.""With Clint Eastwood directing, Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela, and Matt Damon sharing top billing, how could Invictus fail? The answer is that it doesn't, as this rich historical drama provides great insight into South African history and the philosophy of one of the 20th century's greatest leaders. The film tells the true story of Mandela's presidency as he struggles to overcome prejudice and years of hatred and violence between blacks and whites. Seeing in the nation's rugby team an opportunity to unite his people, he befriends the team's captain (Damon).
While loaded with true-life sports movie clichés, Invictus overcomes them through the strength of its acting and the attention to political detail, from the desire of blacks to take back their country to the fears of whites about losing their voice in the newly democratic nation. I was fascinated and moved by the power of Mandela's philosophies of forgiveness, respect, and fellowship to steer both groups in the direction of unity. Invictus has brief strong language but is otherwise free of potentially offensive content.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Jarmusch, inviolable master of slow psychedelic movies. If you do not like slow movies do not even try to watch this, cause there's virtually no plot at all. Movie is based on characterization of protagonists, building of heavy atmosphere and it is visually fantastic. Although it technically falls within vampire/fantasy genre, movie does not have any of it's characteristics. Tilda and Tom for two hours became old married couple of vampires that will make you forget that vampires are just the fruit of the imagination and experience this movie as exceptionally realistic drama. Of course, Jarmusch wouldn't be Jarmusch if great psychedelic music didn't follow whole story. I saw Jim's opus long time ago, but if my memory does not deceive me, only Dead Man is better than this one.
8,5/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I just found this movie after watching 2 masterpieces - Hacksaw ridge and The Arrival. I must say I am much more impressed with this film.
First off it is hard to tell if the story of this movie is a Western, Heist Crime Drama or deep socioeconomic study reflecting the state of affairs in an important part of American society.
Script is very good, dialogues are very realistic and characters are developed just enough. No pretentious pressure on the spectator to bond with the protagonists. It is not a story of heroes or villains it is more a study of a situation with realistic characters with a story in it.
Pace is slow for fast paced action lovers, but it is in no way bad. It just contributes to highly atmospheric nature of the movie and bursts of tension spice up the flow and fit very well in it.
Photography is very good. Not breathtaking or spectacular but still masterful, and you can see the hand of the director and his team in carefully crafting every scene, and everything withing a shot.
Scenography is mostly beautiful rural mid-west landscape and boring small towns with their motels, diners, bars, casinos and banks.
Acting is outstanding. Especially Jeff Bridges, but I must say every episodic role seemed to me to be acted very good. Even some memorable performances of a couple probably non-professional actors.
Sound is great, no dialogue is unintelligible, no music is out of place and action scenes are not much more louder than the rest of the movie.
It is really extremely difficult to find any flaw in this memorable accomplishment of the film crew.
This movie will make you think. It might explain to you why Trump won the last election. It could even give additional fuel for thinking to the participants of the gun ownership debate in the US. There is only one dishonorable villain this movie points a finger at - the banks.
Some people are screaming out loud that there is a giant plot hole in the film cos having found oil on your mortgaged property means there is no motivation for you to get money through all this trouble. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING about. Mineral, gas and oil rights are very complicated in mortgage situations and none of the cases are strictly defined by laws. Most cases are regulated on contract by contract basis and in connection with state laws but in most cases contracts favor the lenders and in some cases finding oil can even mean automatic forfeiture of the mortgage to the bank.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** M. Night Shyamalan continued to deliver the thrills in this new spin on the superhero tale. When David Dunn (Bruce Willis) wakes up after an awful train accident as the sole survivor without a scratch on him.

This epic story tells of the journey of two priests who come to Japan to find their lost teacher. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) are the two young priests that venture to hostel Japan. They have received news that their teacher Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has apostatized against the Christian faith. They do not believe the rumors and determine that they will travel to Japan to retrieve their father and discover the truth while spreading the gospel.
The brutal torture of Japanese Christians is revealed early and continues throughout the film making this a movie that could be difficult to watch for some. The Inquisitor (Issei Ogata) persecutes the faithful with elaborate tactics that conspire to bring out the worst in humans. They provide religious tests like stepping on an image of Christ or spitting on a cross to weed out the Christians. They put the citizens to death making the priests doubt their mission and put out a bounty for the priests' capture.

T2 Trainspotting is a continuation of the first film with a 20 year gap in-between. All the boys are here: Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), they're back in Edinburgh and ready for the next chapter of their lives. If you have not seen Trainspotting before, watch it. Not just because it is a good film but you need to remember the first one to properly understand this one. Then you need to immediately put it out your mind because this is definitely a sequel, not a re-hash of what was. The characters are older and because of this they are different to how they were, their lives are different, their relationships are different, their motivations, their attachments, everything has changed, you have probably changed too and yet many of the situations and scenes have a very familiar feel to them. Links to the past, little nods here and there to both the first film and real life are strewn throughout but never feel forced.
As you would expect from a Danny Boyle film, the style is great and each scene has a purpose whether it is to remind the viewer of who these people where, or show them where they are heading. It is true the story is not as hard hitting, but then how could it be? And yes, Begbie is a bit of a caricature now and not quite the man he was in the first instalment but you know what? That's OK. Any failings or let downs are immediately made up for by something else. Something good. The story touches on so much it just keeps you engaged. Friendship, love, betrayal, regret, hope, despair, danger  it's all in there, in spades! This is a good film and possibly more importantly, a great sequel. If you loved the first, as I did, then I can't imagine a reason you wouldn't like this one. If however, you did not like the first, it may just be different enough for you still to enjoy.
Choose life. Choose T2 Trainspotting.""It is not a perfect movie and it's not artsy, or profound. However, it is very entertaining, has wide appeal, will make you laugh, have you on the edge of your seat and might even make you cry. It's a slow build at the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked. Deepwater Horizon is a movie that succeeds on two levels: as an action-packed blockbuster and as an honest depiction of a tragic disaster. It's the story of the BP oil rig that exploded and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico. It is great movie.
On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an oil drilling rig operated by private contractor Transocean, is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP. Engineer Michael ""Mike"" Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and rig supervisor James ""Jimmy"" Harrell (Kurt Russell) are surprised to learn that the workers assigned to drill for get oil without to keep the well stable. James and Michael force BP to do the pressure test on pipe line. The pressure test I negative; however, Without, waiting for Harrell to confirm the results, Vidrine orders the well to be opened.
At first, the operation goes smoothly, but the foundation eventually gives way, triggering a massive blowout that overpowers and kills eleven people.
As night falls and the burning oil lights up the area, the Coast Guard becomes aware of the incident and sends a ship to collect the survivors and rescue everyone.
Returned home, the workers reunite with their families in a hotel lobby. The film ends with a series of clips showing the aftermath of the disaster, including testimony from the real-life Mike Williams and the revelation that not a single employee of either Transocean or BP was prosecuted for their actions. Pictures appear of the 11 men who lost their lives before the credits.""I'm a 30 year old man, so probably not what the producers envisioned as their primary market, but I still love this movie!
Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR!
I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.
Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.
I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.
Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent.
I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we will get to see a sequel!""Once again Alice brings power to women's, telling that we need to stand up for ourselves, our goals, and shows that we only need courage to go further, persistency and faith to conquer the impossible. Although the movie is a pure fantasy reality based on an astonishing book, this is a great metaphor to overcome the obstacles and negativity that try to bring us down everyday. In the other hand, teach us that we should always help a true friend in pain, like the Hatter. In this second work, the viewer have the opportunity to explore more of the Wonderland and it's characters, specifically, the life story of the Red Queen, the way Time acts and the struggles of the Mad Hatter. If you want to emerge in this magical world beyond a mirror's glass and above the waves of time, watch this piece and let your mind go to unknown places.""Underworld blood Wars is a instant horror classic that will be remembered for years and years from now. The acting was flawless the movie itself was just pure amazing that you will wish it would never end. When I saw this movie I saw it in 3D and it was some of the best 3D I have ever seen in my whole life. This movie was one of those films where you are like wow now that is what I call a great movie. This movie will make you fall in love with movies again
Parents this is a R rated movie for a great reason and that reason is because of bloody violence. If you don't think your kids should see this movie then they should not see it because it is bloodtastic. This is what I call a great horror film and I hope you enjoy this masterpiece""Deadpool is a masterpiece for the following reasons: beyond the traditional rules and Hollywood stereotypes, is irreverent, vulgar and violent beyond belief, the action scenes simply perfect, hilarious dialogues (though vulgar for an audience of minors, but not much they would understand the jokes). Ryan Reynolds is perfect in the part, as indeed all the characters. Many hate it, but they have not caught the ironic spirit of the character or simply do not know and were expecting a film type Spider- Man or Iron-Man, but Deadpool is not any of it and enjoy it is a hoot in a rush . I can not wait to come out Deadpool 2 in 2018.""This movie is a masterpiece!!! One of the greatest ever. Everything was perfect, the direction, the idea, the plot, the cast, the ending, the music(Zimmer). And for those who are saying non sense, its a sci-fi!!!! The matrix makes sense?? No, but we still love it! And some people saying its boring and predictable??!!Lol. And some people rating this low because they like action and horror movies like fast&furious and saw... or they didn't understand the movie... This movie is one of the greatest movies ever, and its a shame this lost to King's speech for best picture and best director. Don't HATE ON A MOVIE IF U Don't LIKE SCI-FI OR U Didn't GET IT!!!""I watched this on Christmas day for the very first time, after seeing so many lists of the greatest Christmas movies ever and this always being number 1.
Now that I have seen it I can understand why and completely agree with all of them.
This is a brilliant story that had me hooked from the very beginning, it completely drags you into the story with the characters and had me caring what happened to them next.
I cannot recommend this enough and think it is the perfect Christmas film for anyone to watch with all the highs and lows it completely immerses you within the world and town it is set.
If only everyone was like George the world would be a much better place.
Complete 10/10 film.
Loved it.""Couple gets left behind while scuba diving in ocean. What happens to them? That's the movie. Seems possible, and once they are alone, everything that happens is realistic.
My problem from the first time I saw this movie had to do with the pretty star and the men on the boat taking them all out to dive and then returning them to shore.
Twenty people diving, three crew members. About 16-17 of divers are men; 2 of 3 crew members are men. of the 3-4 female divers, only our star is gorgeous. 18-19 men would have noticed this woman the moment they got on the boat. They would know what she was wearing, how she wore her hair, her best assets. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN, and that's how we are wired.
So when the couple doesn't come back, it is virtually impossible that the 18-19 men wouldn't have noticed and called attention to the crew.
Of course then you wouldn't have had a movie, but to create a story where so many young men don't notice the hottest woman on the boat is just not believable.""""I will tell you three stories. And when I'm done with my stories, will you tell me a fourth. I don't know any stories. You will tell me a fourth and it will be the truth.""
I'm not easily impressed and rating a movie with a maximum score is an oddity for me, but the impact of ""A monster calls"" on me was unprecedented. And not only because of the deeper meaning behind the story of young Conor and his terminally ill mother Lizzie, but also because of the brilliant performances of Lewis MacDougall and Sigourney Weaver (Conor's grandmother), the modest acting of Felicity Jones, the sometimes masterfully used special effects and the three profound stories told by the monster with the impressive deep voice of Liam Neeson. It's not really surprising it turned out to be an emotionally charged story. Only the emotional parts are so pure and humane that even I, who usually looks at such moments soberly and dry-eyed, got a lump in my throat. But especially the denouement gave the story a mysterious turn. Overall, a fantastic film that deserves the maximum score.
When I say I have an unspeakable admiration for the young actor Lewis MacDougall, you can safely say it's a huge understatement. This young boy has such charisma and naturelle. Why this film was not even nominated for an Oscar, is for me a complete mystery. The emotions young Conor is going through, are so diverse and he displays them in such an obvious way. I can only conclude that he's a natural acting talent. The character Conor handles a wide spectrum of emotions. From rage and anger, to some brief happy moments. From fear and despair, to courage and determination. And finally the immense grief after the loss of a loved one, the letting go and the acceptance as central themes. All this is brought by this young actor convincingly. Respect.
The film tends to place itself into the fantasy corner, with this huge yew tree that moves around in a destructive way. It reminded me of one of ""The Ents"" from ""Lord of the Rings"". The same appearance. The same voice full of wisdom. The only goal this creature out of Connor's fantasy has, is to make it clear to him that life isn't always rosy or easy, and that he'll be confronted with difficult moments during his life. Conor's life on the other hand isn't so rosy and he faced already some terrible events in his short life. A fatherless upbringing, a terminally ill mother and the terrible bullying at school. Situations that cause him to enter a psychological whirligig with terrible nightmares as a result. Nightmares in which he consistently tries to save his mother, while she threatens to disappear into a huge crater. And always the nightmare ends with him not being able to save his mother. You don't need to be Freud to know the deeper psychological meaning of that dream.
Some will say perhaps ""A monster calls"" belongs to the category of youth movies. However, I don't share that opinion. Even though the tree monster looks intriguing and not too creepy. And those stories are presented as with water-ink illustrated fairy tales. Nevertheless, the ultimate message is of a more mature nature. The fairy-tale stories have a rather sinister undertone and deal with deception and guile. They are telling the story of the complex human mind. I'm afraid that children will only see the fairy-tale of the tree and won't understand the deeper meaning behind it. I even wondered if there wasn't even a hidden story behind the main story? Wasn't the man next to Lizzie, on that picture hanging in that room in the end, Liam Neeson? And what about the content in that sketchbook that Conor is looking at in the end? And how come the monster turns up at 00: 07 from the beginning on? When all the pieces fell into place in the end, it felt as if it opened a completely different dimension. After that I could only gaze at the screen while feeling numb and confused. What is it that makes a movie to reach perfection? It's not just because of the matchless imagery. And not only because of the wonderful performances. Or that beautiful story. But also because of the effect a movie has on me. ""A monster calls"" has all these features and especially the last item. So, I call this movie perfection.
More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Neon Genesis Evangelion is the greatest television show ever made, so it's only fitting that it's concluded by one of the greatest films ever made.
The complex, intertwining character arcs of the original series collide in a beautiful, apocalyptic nightmare. A nightmare which visually conveys the internal conflict of our main protagonist, Shinji Ikari, in manner that is anything but clear at face value. With haunting imagery and piercing, impacting sound work, this film is a cinematic treat to behold. If you enjoy the weirder sides of films, then this is definitely for you.
The lack of a succinct, storybook ending allows for a lot of analysis so even months (or years) later you'll still be thinking of it.
I love it, and feel no review (especially one of this size) can do it justice. Watch it (after the show) and if it doesn't work for you, then that's fine. However, if it does, I can promise you it will become one of your favorite films of all time.""While the Polar Express has become an Xmas classic in the past 12 years Zemeckis' follow-up has sort of taken a backseat (and his return to live action has been met with constant disappointment). It's a shame because Beowulf is a visually stunning film with a dark, brooding atmosphere. It may not be Xmas-y but it sure is winter-y and perfect viewing for this time of year.
Based on the ancient epic poem (among the very earliest ""English"" literature) the story sees famous hero Beowulf arrive in Denmark to defeat Grendel, a horrific monster who has been terrorizing the locals. Beowulf likes to exaggerate his life and some are suspicious of him but when he lures Grendel into a confrontation his reputation is validated and he quickly becomes the reigning monarch. Many decades later Grendel's mother reveals a shocking secret and threatens Beowulf's kingdom with total destruction.
This is not the family-friendly viewing of the Pole Ex. Beowulf is brutal, bloody, very gory, and sometimes hard to watch. Grendel is one of the most gruesome, ugliest monsters ever to appear in a movie but Crispin Glover's typically eccentric performance (after settling a years-long feud with Zemeckis over BTTF 2) is harrowing and sympathetic. He may be a merciless killer but it's very hard not to feel sorry for him. Themes of surrendering to wicked temptation, regret, and mortality continue to resonate to this day. In fact, I honestly cannot think of any other work of fiction that has had as much influence on literature, history, and even popular culture (other than the Bible) as the ancient poem by Anonymous.
Alan Silvestri's score is, as usual, highly involving and emotional lending a huge weight to the cold, lonely feel of the movie. Ray Winstone is the perfect actor to bring a voice to the character mixing cockney charm, bravado, honor, and secret shame to what might otherwise be a hollow CGI creation.
Please do not write this movie off. It seems like it still struggling to find an audience despite being one of my favorite of Zemeckis' career.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** An omniscient (though possibly unreliable)[7] narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a duel over a sale of some horses. The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.

Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay.

In the aftermath, Barry is urged to flee from incoming police and head through the countryside towards Dublin, but along the way he is robbed of purse, pistol, and horse by Captain Feeney, an infamous highwayman.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The general idea is a prodigy of simplicity: to turn a whole set of successful science-fiction dramas or romances or adventures into a full-blown comedy and make all these frightening things that make you dream of a world that will never exist like in Star Wars or in Star Trek hilariously funny so that the audience just never stops laughing. Steven Spielberg adds to that a direct allusion to Back to the future but within the science fiction space adventure genre and it becomes phony more than funny, with me grown up meeting me four years old.
The first two films are really funny because they remain within one layer of time. The third one becomes something different, nostalgic, sentimental even, and that breaks the fun to turn it into fear: the fear the negated past or the traumatized past may turn the future which is our present into a nightmare, a PTSS case of time travel trauma, something like PTTTSS, Post Time Travel Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Welcome to the asylum for deeply disturbed minds and brains.
The most attractive and fascinating aspect is the phenomenal palette and variety of extra-terrestrials you are navigating among. Obviously all of them are just the figment of the imaginations of a band of deranged probably young people generally called artists though there might be a few older ones who are more perverse than deranged, or perversely corrugated. You cannot find them serious. They are all of them just impossible mixtures of all kinds of living gadgets, except in the last one where one of them is well hidden in a human body and is deadly frightening, not funny at all.
The next element that is striking is the role of the Black man in black, just recruited in the first film, trained and excellently performing and competent in the second film and growing melancholy and sentimental in the last film when he sees himself when he was four, when his father was killed under his adult eyes and when with a magic flash the little boy will only remember his father was a hero. And of course it is his partner who erases the truth from the little boy's memory, the partner he meets again in the present some seconds later at the end of the film. That episode brings the saga to an end because the fun has been drunk right down to the tea leaves at the bottom of the cup.
We all, absolutely all of us, have rebuilt the image of the father we had, in pink or in black, in celestial blue or in fiery red, but what we remember of our father is nothing but a mental reconstruction, a Lego reconstruction. All the pieces are true, real and absolutely precise, but the pieces have been reassembled in any creative or traumatic way and that's the image we have of the man we call our father. That's normal. That's natural. That's the truth if there is one under the sun. Our memory is selective. In fact, we remember everything without fault but our conscious memory is the Lego construction I have just spoken of.
You may have in some drawer, or in your pocket, something that is attached to your father in a way or another and that reached you when you were three or four. This thing is attached to you and you are attached to it in an unbreakable union and yet you don't really know why you're attached to it and it is attached to you. It might be a sentence that comes back regularly and that makes you sick with fear or happy with instant bliss, and yet you do not know where it comes from, except that it comes from a long, long time ago and you still have it in your mind because it was a positive or negative trauma, and, mind you, there are positive happy traumas that have the same power as negative ones, except that this power makes you excel and not run away and hide under your bed.
If you want to have some fun in an environment of extraterrestrial monsters, with some dangerous situations and beings and many happy just in time right in time epiphanies and salvations, you have to let yourself slide into these hairy and over-twisted stories and forget about your bills and the fact that the heating does not work. You'll survive since these crazy characters did survive.
Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU""This movie sports some of the tightest, most detail oriented editing I have ever seen. Nearly every detail from the first act comes around again in some form in the second act. The cuts are stylized and masterfully done. There are many references to other films, both subtle and blatant and the storytelling is as tight as can be.
It's funny and action packed and a bit gory. It lovingly parodies both British mystery dramas and American action movies. I am normally the first to point out flaws in movies, even those I absolutely love. This movie however is nearly flawless, and frankly the techniques employed here ought to be taught in film schools everywhere.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time. Surprisingly accurate to the book, it follows the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the daughter of a plantation owner. She cares nothing about the important things in life, and revolves entirely on her whimsical desires and crushes. A complete and utter flirt, Scarlett literally throws herself upon the man that she believes herself to be in love with - Ashley Wilkes. Ashley isn't man enough to tell her that he doesn't love her, and her wild passion for him carries on as the South plunges into war against the Yankees. To spite Ashley marrying Melanie Hamilton, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother who dies at war. Her next marriage is also unsuccessful, and finally she ends up with the lovable rogue that is Rhett Butler. But it is only at the end when Scarlett's lifelong nightmare of running through a dark mist becomes reality, that she realizes that Ashley does not love her, and that it doesn't matter to her that he doesn't. The realization that she does indeed love her husband, Rhett, comes too late, as he has come to the decision to leave her. She asks him what she will do without him, to which he famously replies: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" Eventually she realizes that until Rhett returns to her, the only thing she has left is her home - the plantation Tara. As she looks out over the land, she finds a reason to hope - passing that hope onto the viewers that Scarlett's life might finally have some real happiness in it. The hope is verbalized in her well known saying, ""Tomorrow is another day!""""What could present a better opportunity for a family-friendly Gothic fantasy film than that easy-going black-and-white TV series, The Addams Family? The source material is just brimming with potential, so when I put this film on, my hopes were high.
What do I like about this film? Well, my biggest highlight is the sheer unflinching goofiness of the whole thing. This movie doesn't, at any point, take itself too seriously, and that in itself just automatically makes it work. I can't even begin to tell you the number of times I've been totally exasperated by directors who try and make their films into epics for the sake of it, when really, they should just take a chill pill. But with this movie, we have a director who fits their film's tone seamlessly around its context. They're not trying to win any BAFTAs; they're just having fun, and as a result, we all have fun too.
The grotesque characters entirely complement this tone. Not one of the actors is in even the slightest bit pretentious. In many more modern films of a similar genre, I've all too often seen wolves of the acting world, who snarl and drool after golden globes and Oscar wins; but the patriots of this particular film are just happy to be there, rolling with it all and having a good time; delightful to see.
There's also a good bit of proper laugh-out loud humour in there. Physical slapstick is the comedic medium most frequently used, and on paper that shouldn't work, but I guess that if it worked for Laurel and Hardy, it'll work elsewhere, and in this movie, it certainly does. It further heightens the laid-back goofiness of the whole thing, so much so that at times, you do genuinely feel as though you're watching one of those silent black-and-white movies, rather than a nineties flick; impressive. In fact, there's a great Easter egg in there which hints at said inspiration.
Is there anything I don't like about this movie? No, but there are one or two minor gaps for nit-picking. Although on the whole I like the tone that this film has, there are a couple of scenes in there which are perhaps just a bit too dark and oppressive. I get that this film needs to have a few creepy elements to it, but there are some tricky scenes which ring too much of a soap-opera-type tone to really fit in with the rest of the movie; they even go so far as to detract a little from the humour.
Also, although most of the makeup effects are bang on, there were a few instances where I felt that the character dressers went into overkill mode. For instance, I felt the makeup for Morticia was quite over-fussed and too akin to the sort of makeup that the average lady would wear. In the TV series, she had no conventional makeup; only white powdering to make her look pale and ghoulish, and if she'd been given the same style in the film, it would have helped her aura hugely. But I'm being really fussy here, and I'm sure other viewers won't mind the change.
Verdict: 92%. Yes, it's cheesy; yes, it's silly; but that's okay, because that's exactly what it needs to be. This is one of those rare gems: a film which makes you feel like a kid all over again. So crammed with wacky humour and likable characters is it that I found myself totally glued to it. Some may dismiss it as tacky, but those with a soul will see it as the trip back to the good ol' days that it is.""As soon as I heard about LION I instantly got it in to my head that I might be watching a reincarnation of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE .

And yet Davis succeeds in a film that might just surprise the Oscars this year
You might have to meet the film on its own terms in order for it to work fully . By this I mean straight from the opening scene I was expecting a caption to crop up at any moment proclaiming ""Australia 20 years later"" as the pivotal moments in India are shown through flashback . This isn't a film that uses a fractured narrative to tell its story . Instead it's very linear and the first half plays out entirely as a foreign language film . Perhaps I'm misleading you because there is very little dialogue in the first half , instead the audience are asked to feel for the plight of young Saroo and nothing needs to be said . The second half then concentrates on Saroo as a young man in Australia only half complete as a human being as he tries to find his long lost mother and brother
One genuine criticism I have at this years Oscar nominations is that many of the contenders feel rather poetic , slow and aloof compared to the in your face stylised LA LA LAND . Not to discredit it LION too has a strangely poetic feel but unlike MOONLIGHT which becomes cold and uninvolving after a while LION continues to keep its slightly hypnotic quality . Some people might claim this might be down to a slightly manipulative soundtrack by Bertelman and O'Halloran but I found the score haunting . Indeed the entire film is a haunting experience and is the film I hope will cause a couple of shocks at the Oscars this year .""I've been a fan of Indian movies since I've watched 3 idiots and while I was searching for another Indian movie to watch with a genre of romantic-comedy (with the likes of Hasee To Phasee, Jab We Met, Khoobsurat) I came across this movie in one of the suggestions.
At first I was hesitant to watch this since it's my first time to watch a film starred by Deepika & Ranbir. I've read in some articles that they are quite famous but still I haven't watched yet their movies.
So it was kinda surprising for me when I saw this film. Yes, it have some cheesy lines and moments delivered by Ranbir but somehow when he delivered it, these scenes became different. It was not cheesy but it became romantic that you watching can't help but smile. :)
The lead stars have total chemistry! Even though there were scenes that they were not saying anything, but its in their eyes that they were totally expressing it. Through their stares, you can feel the emotion they are trying to convey. Awesome performance by the way!
The plot also was very nice. You thought that this would happen but the next thing you know, it will be totally different. It was realistic & it showed that sometimes you have to choose between your dreams and the love of your life. That it doesn't mean that if you love a person, he/she will be the one for you and to spend the rest of your life with. A lot of people could really relate to this film. All in all, a very big thumbs up for this movie! If you want a feel good, make-you-want-to-smile-but- also-cry kinda movie then you should definitely watch this. You won't be disappointed. :)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I walked out of the theater on July 15, 2011 after seeing the finale of the Harry Potter franchise, I didn't realize then just how much the film had made an impact on me. Perhaps it didn't affect me that much all at back then. However, nearly 5 and 1/2 years later, I realize that's it so much more than an action film. Rewatching the film time and time again, I never fail to get a bit emotional when the opening title shows up in its customary 3D-like appearance. The somber music also helps get the nostalgia train going. However, once the customary Warner Bros logo and title card opening is over, the film picks up immediately where DH Part 1 left off. Harry, Ron and Hermione have just escaped from Malfoy Manor and are hiding out at Bill Weasley's (Ron's brother, for non-Potter fans) shell cottage. The trio then travels to the great wizarding bank Gringotts, where an impressive action sequence occurs involving a dragon and a magic door. This kicks off the second leg of their quest to find mysterious Horcruxes, objects crucial to defeating You-Know-Who. The battle between good and evil at Hogwarts is visually stunning and emotionally powerful, with beloved characters either perishing or having their own hero moments. I'll stay tight-lipped about the ending of the film for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that it's the perfect sendoff to the magical franchise that has captured the hearts of millions over the last decade and a half.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I was just shocked to see that many of you guys are somehow totally missed this movie as it is about the Bible. DeCaprio is either acting as a fake Jesus or a Fallen Angel. The story is as old as it gets God has a dream and saw this before, its about deception where you can make all you want in your life just do what Mr Charles says so you wont be aware the fact you are being deceived totally blind by doing so. In this case DeCaprio can be a false promise too as he may have no bad intentions yet he is doing harm without knowing it. When his new disciple the school girl built those mirror walls Marion rushes in and after the school girl has been woken up before she could kill her. Yet the school girl was complaining for DeCaprio. He is such a charmer... and once you would maybe not just looking out of your head you could easily see fantastic clues that this masterpiece offers only for those that are present and not just physically speaking with an empty shell heart. Anyway I don't want to sound rude but how come you don't see it? It is about LIFE your choices, your soul is the safe of God at the beginning. The Father and his Son, Businessmen the Son will inherit his Empire :) How much more would you need? I admit it is a brilliant work and for people not familiar with anything other than a Car, big boobs, a diamond ring and Ray Ban Sunglesses with Gucci shoes well I could go on and on explaining you our whole history it still won't do a thing as you don't simply care about it. It is a choice. Yours, only.""This film is a lifetime experience. I have seen this movie multiple time to go ahead with my life surpassing problems. Not only you learn about life,you get to realize the meaning of life. This movie points out education system perfectly around world. We can clearly see through a engineers lifestyle. We can learn what is motive of our education should be. We can see friendship,enemy-ship,competition,innovation,comedy,tragedy,romance and almost anything a movie can offer without action or sci-fi. A movie with multiple message. Any of that can change the perspective of life. This movie cannot be hated by anyone in my guess.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a movie called MASTERPIECE!!!
It rightly won the 2012 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film.
It is easily one of the best emotional family drama since the turn of the millennium. A truly engrossing and captivating movie which portrays the helplessness of a son taking care of his old father suffering from Alzheimer's, his wife trying to provide their daughter a better future, the daughter trying to protect their parent's marriage and also the life of a poor family struggling to make ends meet.
The beauty of this movie is that anyone can relate to it and connect with the characters and their emotions. The actors and I mean all of them are excellent to say the least.
I assure you, watch this movie and you will think about it for days. Rest assured you will be swept off your feet. A beautifully directed film, work of an artist - Asghar Farahadi.""For the most part, I enjoyed this very unusual farce. Casting two men who made themselves up as women in order to escape the wrath of a murderous Chicago gang was a clever plot idea. The incorporation of the historic St. Valentine's Day gangland massacre into the screenplay provides some diversion from the business of trying to continue fooling people into believing that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are women. Tony and Jack are the principal comedy team. We have 2 other actors: Marilyn Monroe and Joe E. Brown, who are principally strait men for the comedians. The members of 2 gang also serve, to a limited extent, as straight men.
The casting was near perfect. Tony and Jack made a great comedy team, and were made up to look like women about as well as possible. The main problems were their manner of walking and their voices, which should have given them away as men. This is a major weakness of the screen play: perhaps fatal if that bothers you too much. Sadly, much of stage and film humor relies on victims who are unusually nonobservant, clumsy or stupid. This reduces the comedic value. Implausible happenings and connections between scenes are frequent in this film. Again, too many of such reduces the comedic value of the film. However, as in this film, this significant negative can often be compensated for by sufficient truly funny happenings. Also, children are no doubt generally less bothered by implausible happenings, judging by the popularity of animations.
The scene where various members of the female band gradually squeeze into Jack's(as female)train berth because he has some bootleg liquor reminds me of the famous scene in The Marx Brothers' ""A Night at the Opera"", where more and more people have a reason to squeeze into their tiny hotel room, falling and climbing all over each other, until the last one opens the door and half spill out.
In addition to masquerading as a woman, Tony masquerades as a rich sea captain, several times going back and forth between one disguise and the other, primarily for the purpose of seducing Marilyn. Clearly, he is trying to imitate Cary Grant's manner of speaking as the captain, reasonably successfully. This somewhat reminds me of a later film starring Tony: ""The Great Imposter"", where he successfully masquerades as a number of men in their work.
It's clear from a comment by Joe E. Brown that the title means that some people prefer jazz.
As usual, Marilyn plays an innocently slutty gold-digger. And, as with so many of her later films, sounds like she was a basket case much of the time, showing up very late or not at all, forgetting her lines, crying and complaining. The director had to put up with these distractions because the public still loved her.""This is a story so sublimely told and exquisitely crafted, and with performances so achingly beautiful and emotive, it would be near impossible not to pull on the tightest of heart strings.
Every frame is a deliberate exploration into the themes of maternity, creation and endless opportunity; uplifting messages founded on a dark premise. The consistency of Lenny Abrahamson's masterful direction and the stunning performances make this an utterly overwhelming experience. Abrahamson even utilises an incredible score at key moments which builds to such an intense crescendo, it manages to crawl under the skin and hold you transfixed on the scene.
It's tough, nail-biting, intense and immersive, but it is genuine and heart-felt, uplifting and inspiring. This is a film that requires repeated viewings as the sheer subtleties within every scene and on every facial expression demand close attention in order to appreciate the pure brilliance that is 'Room'.
For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/""For my 100th review on IMDb I knew I had to make is special, there have always been a few films that I said I would never review on the site and Inception is one of them mainly because it's my favourite movie of all time so it's hard for me to truly get across just how much this film has inspired me. I am however going to give it a try, for one Christopher Nolan gives some of the best direction ever given to a film because it's dine in such an ambitious way, he's always trying something new to really sell us to this world of the dream that all look absolutely stunning, they feel genuine as they would come across as in this situation, I don't care if I'm kicking a dead horse but Nolan deserved an academy award for his masterful directing of this film. This film completely respects the intelligence of its audience, Nolan doesn't try to sugarcoat any of the tough to understand dialogue but gives full complicated speeches on this complex process, I can tell you that I had a very hard time understanding this film when I first saw it but that didn't make me feel less intelligent it measly made me want to go back and watch it again and again. The performances in this film are all perfect, none of the actors or actresses try to overact but give subtle performances that feel real and less movie like. Leonardo DiCaprio is so fantastic in this movie he's so perfect at selling his characters pain, his character is also impeccably written, he's given a clear reason for why he is trying to perform this last job and it gives the audience a better reason to get behind him as a person. I loved Ellen Page in this film she had amazing chemistry with DiCaprio and was out conduit into this world. Tom Hardy could not have been better cast in this film he was hilarious and stopped this film from having all similar characters. The way this film is structured is done to perfection, its built like a heist film so in the first half we get an ingenious look into this technology and its workings and in the second half we get a mind blowing sequence that has incredible action scenes, impeccable set design and we get a true conclusion to DiCaprios character. Everything in this second half is built up perfectly and has your heart beating and your 100% invested in the characters. This is mainly due to the script that ensures that this isn't just an action film with a good premise and some cool explosions but instead a thought provoking piece of film making. The ending of Inception is one of the most effective ever put to film, it gives e dry viewer a different perspective and allows them to always explore it in a different way with every repeat viewing.
Inception is beyond masterful, it's a thought provoking, incredibly entertaining, emotional investing piece of cinematic brilliance, I can not begin to tell you just how much Inception has gone on too inspire me to explore film it self. This will forever be my favourite film and will always hold a special place in my heart.
100%/A+""If you would like to watch a true example of gifted movie-making then look no further. How does one make an extremely complicated story like the journalistic investigation of a simple break-in that evolved into the fall of the complete Nixon administration, comprehensible but down-right engrossing, this is how!
It would have been really easy for this complicated plot to have been a total intellectual snore-fest, yet what we get is not only one of the most exciting paper-chases in film history but an astonishingly good looking film to boot. Watch carefully how a simple newspaper copy room turns into an eye-grabbing set piece with beautifully staged lighting and just the right touches of color and modern decor to bring a vibrancy to the screen that you would never expect in a movie of this type. The film is carefully crafted all the way through to give it a look of elegance as a backdrop to the gritty realistic pursuits of these two young and relentless reporters who are hot on the trail of something 'Big'.
'All The Presidents Men' has been cited dozens of times as a major influence upon succeeding generations of screen writers as perhaps the most perfect screen-adaption of this type and how to go about writing a story of intense complications and make it entertaining and invigorating to watch as it unfolds. Perfectly cast with Robert Redford and Dustin Huffman in the prime of their acting craft they chew up every scene with relish, showing us what great actors can become when they inhabit their characters on screen completely and nothing is left wanting.
With an all-star supporting cast that is second to none and a director with a eye honed for tension-filled static camera angles, you will notice that the camera rarely shifts around but is framed like a window allowing us to feel like we are participating in real events rather than some Hollywood style action movie, yet it never pretends to be a docudrama either.
I could gush on and on about this movie on many more levels but who needs to- Just watch it and not only will you be highly entertained but you will learn why the Watergate Break-in was a history changing event in American Political life and a horrendous betrayal of the people's trust that almost went unnoticed if not for the religious zeal of these two fantastic investigative journalists. A Perfect Political- thriller 10! Watch-it!""The Nice Guys is a return to a subgenre that we barely see anymore done like this: adult buddy action comedies. This movie is directed by Shane Black who is the king of buddy action movies with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon under his belt. It is a great throwback to those kinds of films with humor, action, and charm.
Good: Gosling and Crowe are great together with fantastic chemistry and it cements Gosling's knack for comedy and surprises with Crowe's wit and quickness. Special props to the girl who played Gosling's daughter who was great and really funny. The humor works with plenty of great dialogue and jokes. The action is filmed cohesively and with plenty of gun play. The attention to detail of the time period is fantastic as well.
Bad: As it is expected, the movie is an action comedy film that follows the formula known in the subgenre. The plot can be a bit complicated for its own good, but that is a small nitpick.
Overall, it is one of the most underrated movies of 2016. It is a good old fashioned buddy action comedy with great performances and action that is refreshingly simple in this world of overstuffed blockbusters and superhero movies."This is a very scary movie. It is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. This is very scarier movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is not a good movie if like to see a lot of blood. But if you are some who likes a great horror story you will like this movie. It got a 7.2 which is a good ratting. But this is such a great film the 7.2 is underrating it. I give it 10 out of 10 because it is a great movie. This is one of the best horror movie around. It is not c.h.e.e.s.e.y. If you like horror movie this is a must see. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say."It's almost unfathomable that in just one year's time, the original entry in the ""Die Hard"" saga will be thirty years old. And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, ""Die Hard"" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.
Bruce Willis stars as Detective John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and children. Arriving at a massive Christmas Party at Holly's workplace in Nakatomi Plaza, things start to seem like they might be looking up for John... until a group of terrorists, lead by the vile Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building, hoping to get their hands on over half a billion dollars in bearer bonds that are locked away in the vault. Escaping the threat and discovering that the police will be completely unable to help, John realizes he must work alone, eluding capture and taking out terrorists one by one if he is to save the day...
Directed by John McTiernan from a script by Jeb Stuart and Steve E. de Souza, the film as just exquisitely assembled. McTiernan's keen eye for visuals and perfect sense of pacing and composition allow the tension and excitement to build with virtually every second as the story progresses and the stakes rise. But he also knows when to pull back and give the characters breathing room to develop and just talk with one another, without rushing through it or over-relying on broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do. Absolutely amazing direction. The screenplay (inspired loosely by the Roderick Thorp novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"") is exceptionally well put- together. de Souza and Stuart craft an instantly identifiable and highly likable cast of characters- including villains you very much love to hate- that all get their proper moment to shine and all feel well-defined and developed. The structure of the film is also very sound, and they strike a perfect balance between story and action in a way few other films have.
We are treated to one of the finest casts to ever populate a tale of adventure in the film. Much has already been said about Bruce Willis and his iconic turn in the role of McClane, but it is still not enough. Bruce Willis just might be the ideal action hero. He's tough, but not unstoppable. Smart, but not a genius. And sharp- witted, but with a certain sense of vulnerability. In many ways, he's the sort-of person anyone and everyone can identify with, and that's what makes McClane such an incredible hero. Alan Rickman- in his first starring role- absolutely steals the show as the villainous Hans, a presence who will charm you, even while you root for him to go down. Rickman is a talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year, and it's roles like this that prove just how great a loss it was. Supporting roles by the likes of Bedelia and William Atherton are exceptional for the material. And Reginald VelJohnson is just magical as Sgt. Al Powell, a cop who offers support to McClane over the radio throughout the film's runtime.
Beyond the cast, the direction and the writing is just simply a phenomenal overall production. Cinematographer Jan de Bont, who would later go on to become a director in his own right, paints a beautiful cinematic image, with outstanding work done, particularly in the lighting and color. Composer Michael Kamen's score is just a blast of pure fun. With a sort-of old-fashioned scope yet a modern flair, the music constantly and consistently compliments the images on-screen perfectly, and it's such a relief that his themes were used in each subsequent film. And editors Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link expertly manipulate the footage so that every shot... every emotion... everything is in service to the story and characters. Now THIS is how you film and cut an action film!
In the end, ""Die Hard"" may soon be turning thirty years old, but it remains as exciting, engaging and enthralling as ever. Upon initial release, it became the perfect example of an adventure done right, and blew audiences away. And it continues to do that now. I honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able to beat it in terms of quality in storytelling and execution of action. It simple is the best action movie ever made. And for that, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.""The best thing about this film is its battles. That's not to say that there isn't more to like, just the battles are brilliant. They're raw, often gruesome, and feel very realistic (even if they really aren't). The passion of the Scottish contrasted with the English soldiers during the battles perfectly shows what the film is about, and makes it more believable that they could take down such a superior force. At first the Scottish are driven by their love for their country, but as the film progresses, and we see that not everyone in Scotland is with them, the drive is for freedom, that they want not just for themselves, but each other.
The score is great, has an uplifting sense of bravery, played with a highland feel, and it fits perfectly.
There are not too many problems that I have with this film. I think that all of the performances are great, but I would have liked to get some more depth to the likes of Stephen and even Isabella, who could have been really interesting given her horrible scenario. The historical inaccuracies are really bad too, but I was mostly able to look past them by deeming this as a work of fiction. And in that respect, ""Braveheart"" is Great.
9/10""STAR RATING: Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning
Twenty years after he double crossed his friends and made off with all their ill gotten gains, Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns home to Edinburgh to make amends with his them, including Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), who's getting by doing sexual extortions with his Bulgarian girlfriend, but has plans to open his own sauna cum brothel, and Spud (Ewen Bremner) whose simple minded nature has scuppered his chances of living a drug free life and is on the verge of suicide. But just as Mark has returned to settle the score with his friends, so the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle) escapes from custody, and the scene is set for a cataclysmic showdown from which nothing will be the same.
In a time when sequels to successful franchises, or even just cult hits, are becoming ten a penny, the always on the cards Trainspotting sequel is one that fans have justifiably had to wait a long time for. Rather than being something that got made just to try and flog a dead horse, the advent of time has worked well here, since it's far more interesting to see how these characters have gone over the course of twenty years than it would have been just a few years afterwards. The course of time has also allowed for a film to be appreciated in its own right, rather than being compared to the first film, with the older characters now more sober and reflective, in contrast to the high energy, in your face relentlessness of the first film.
That's not to say that the film doesn't have it's own slant to take on the modern day world, most notably with Renton's 'choose life' speech from the first film modified to include Facebook and reality TV, and it's just as relevant and insightful but, like everything else, just slower and more considered than in the first film. It also comes more toward the end of the film than the start of it, which just goes to show how more slow and considered Danny Boyle wanted to make it. Even the pulsating soundtrack from the first film is used here in a more gentle way, including a maudlin use of Born Slippy.
While it's all very interesting catching up with these guys in the first half, the second part loses focus somewhat, and it starts to meander without any solid story and ends up dragging on slightly. But it's still a worthwhile, satisfying update, full of sly nods to its predecessor, and a sobering contrast between the energy and expectancy of what could be and the downbeat, depressing reality of what becomes. ****""well, the missing 1 is taken by Anthony Hopkins, worst performance i ever saw, and at 64 i saw my share of movies.... boring, predicted, disgustingly dressed, why was he in this movie? Best performance though, goes to Ben Kingsley, I never liked the man, but in this film he is so great!!! the man found his niche, he is unbelievable!!!! The story is, as expected, ridiculous, but who cares? the action is amazing, the crooks look like real crooks, not the typical idiots, real mean and determined, the cars, oh, the cars.... Felicity is beautiful, and Nicholas Hoult, hmmm.... he's OK. All in all, a great action film, not up to the Fast and the Furious films, but stands excellently on it's own as a good afternoon time spend.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Simply put what a brilliant film, McAvoy's performance was just a joy to behold, intense and gripping. It is quite an intense film, that really towards the end had me on the edge of my seat.
Wasn't quite sure where it was going with the three female prisoners, but once they were gradually separated and we were left with Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey, who gave us sympathetic point of view as we were left to watch her battle of wills with ""The Horde"".
Love the little twist at the end that ties it and implies it's sequel to the previous Shyamalan film, Unbreakable, that sort of hints that we may get third movie involving Bruce Willis' David Dunn.
For me this felt Shyamalan was back on form and if we do get a follow-up to make this a trilogy hopefully we will get see to David V Goliath clash of epic proportions of David Dunn v The Horde/Beast.
Time up the ante and bring it on Mr Shyamalan.""The great thing about a limitless cinema card is you can risk going to see a film you think you won't enjoy as all you're risking is time. I haven't played the game and had no idea what the film was about. But none of that mattered . The plot was easy to follow , the script and acting was good . The use of CGI was brilliant at recreating medieval Spain while at the same time the futuristic high tech future of the A corporation experimental facility . But what really stood out was the SOUND , this movie deserves an Oscar , I have never experienced such amazing sound in a movie , it really enhanced the experience in 2D , in 3D it must be even more enjoyable . If you want a good solid piece of cinematic enjoyment then this is your film. Pad.A 8/10""THIS IS AN ADULT MOVIE. It borders on tedium. It's raw, it's brutal, and often disturbing. But this shining moment in Camelot belongs solely to Natalie Portman. I have followed her career with great anticipation, from her auspicious opener as a precocious 14-year old in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, to a memorable performance as the young heroine in ""V for Vendetta."" But it seems that her later performances became frustratingly ""spotty,"" culminating in her shockingly amateurish star turn in ""Star Wars,"" with an equally bad Hayden Christensen. It seemed that Portman did not live up to the early potential of her blazing childhood debut. But in this biopic, she hit a home run with the bases loaded, in the bottom of the ninth. She was flat-out amazing. She didn't merely PLAY the role, she INHABITED IT. Many actors have tackled the role of this enduring American iconmany with a stronger physical similaritybut she owned the part, all of her past work leading to this singular performance. When the Oscars are given out at year's end, look for Portman to be a front runner. Kudos to a brief but brilliant John Hurt as the unnamed priest, and honorable mention to the Director of Photography's stark and bare camera work, managing to capture the incredible loneliness of a woman in utter disarray.""It's been a very long time since I watched the Disney version of this. But some things do get burned into your brain and you don't forget them. Like a particular song, although for a long time I only knew the German lyrics to that song. And don't worry, this is not a musical (or do worry if that is your thing), it just happens to have a couple of songs in in it (very good and amusing ones at that).
The story is kind of timeless, the CGI is very up to date of course. And it seems like a new trend has been kick-started with this. Other ""classic"" stories will follow it's steps (Legend of Tarzan is supposedly one of them, though I haven't watched it and cannot confirm it, just by hearsay). Comedy works quite nicely and the drama is there too. Really enjoyable""This movie feels like a love letter to classic Kurosawa movie making and I think Scorcese nails it. There's a bit of Tarkovsky in the storytelling as instead of feeling sympathy towards the heroes and malevolence towards the villains, you end up with a sense of indifference and a reminder that not every villain is evil.
The movies biggest flaw is probably the lack of direction at times, yet I am unsure how deliberate this was by the filmmakers. As an obvious homage to Kurosawa and a possible one to Tarkovsky I enjoy this method of storytelling. It allows the viewer to interpret the story themselves, rather than saturating the movie with needless exposition and dialogue to reinforce a point.
Sure, this isn't Goodfellas, but instead its a total different direction for Scorcese to tell a story and I think this film is beautiful. Is it Scorceses best work? To be honest, it doesn't matter.""Every once in a while a film comes along which stands out from the pack. A film where all of the elements come together to create a visual storytelling work of art. It doesn't happen often, perhaps once a year if we are lucky. And it nearly always happens with true stories like this one.
The cinematography is beautiful, and whilst the locations perhaps made this easy. Add a musical score that is one of the best I have heard in years, and you are still only halfway to making a masterpiece. The cast and direction complete the recipe. With brilliant performances from all involved.
If there is one film you see this year it should be this one. It is an emotional journey with moments of sadness and anger, mixed in with joy and relief. A good movie makes you feel something, this one makes you feel everything.""Despite not completely succeeding in terms of blockbusters, 2016 was a year were the smaller films got to succeed and He'll of High Water is a perfect example of this. This is a highly original, tension filled and character driven film that I absolutely loved. Hell of High Water was a perfectly paced film, were thrown right into the situation and we keep at the same pace for the entire film as we witness these bank robberies, it's never slow enough to bore but it's not to fast so that it doesn't take the time to build its characters, all the characters in this film are perfectly developed, they all have crystal clear motivations for their actions and there are no light weights in this film. Chris Pine and Ben Foster both give the best performances of there entire careers in this film, they both feel like brothers who are very different but in many ways very similar, they had amazing chemistry and made for a perfect emotional drive for this film. But in terms of Character interaction Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham absolutely stole this movie, like Pine and Foster they both felt like they'd known each other for a long time, they were hilarious together and felt like true friends who poke fun at each other but ultimately trust one and other. The bank robberies all feel realistic, you feel the quick and rapid pace of them, the intensity it real and it have for a perfect representation of how differently Pine and Foster operate from each other. While many characters in this film do a lot of bad things there aren't really any villains in this film because we see all their different points of view and it ensures that their are no singular characters to get behind. It's also just terrifically entertaining, the action is very well filmed and makes this film a pretty good re watch for me. My only real issue with this film is the fact that, at times it's a bit emotionally manipulative, I understand that we're meant to get invested in the characters but at times it came across as just needlessly depressing.
Hell or High Water was one of the best films of 2016, its got terrific performances, investing characters, well done action, a perfectly paced narrative and it's a film that completely invests you in its story. Despite being needlessly depressing at times this is an absolutely fantastic thriller.

This is a slow burn thriller, that can seen a little ""disarticulated"" at first. The key character is a mess, who on first inspection, comes across as a obsessive compulsive, chaotic, alcoholic whose actions seem random, self inflicted and without merit.
Yet, if you give this film a chance, you will come to see this is, in fact, a delicately crafted film.Pieces that don't fit, have, in fact, been cleverly placed to mislead and distract. Its a film that will have you looking at things from different perspectives and each time, reaching different conclusions.
When the picture does finally start to come together, the assumptions I made dissolved and then coalesced into something new. Much as the clever writers and director intended.
All in all, a good watch for those willing to invest the time and patience. Eight out of ten from me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I felt as though I was physically present in the stadium of the wrestling scenes which made me completely clap, scream and also gave me a lot of goosebumps.I especially loved Fatima Sana Shaikh, the elder Geeta's role, not once I felt a bad remark on her performance as an actor. The wrestling scenes were highly entertaining and hats off to the team that is responsible.As with most of Aamir sir's movies, this too has a message for the society.Mahavir, before Geeta's finals, reminds the latter that his match will be looked to as an inspiration for any girl all across India to break loose from the clutches of a Patriarchal society.""I saw Titanic 4 times when it came out ... Still in theaters. I've never done that. Not before or since. It is not just the story of the sinking or the loss of life. I mean...there's that story, well-told. But the love story of Jack and Rose told against the backdrop of an epic disaster is so poignant. It was a phenomenon...the movie was. I watched it again tonight ... 20 years later, and it holds up even now. Titanic is James Cameron's Mona Lisa. His Free Bird. A masterpiece. Don't listen to the naysayers and haters commenting here on IMDb ...that it's overrated. If anything a film that garnered 11 academy awards rated a 7.7 on IMDb is grossly UNDERrated. It's a beautiful film still.""People only gives bad reviews all because there's no Paul walker, Vin diesel, or Dwayne Johnson in it. It all matters on looks these days not the plot or comedian, just looks. Moana is boring and not even funny people only gave it good reviews all because Dwayne Johnson was on it not the plot itself. The light saber fight was good the sound effects sounds so awesome and it's awesome when more than 1 event is happening throughout the star wars films. Once again people only gave it bad reviews all because there's no Paul walker in it or Dwayne Johnson or Vin diesel. People only rate movies base on looks more than the plot and comedian.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Zootropolis is a fun comedic adventure film made by Disney in 2016. The good thing about this film is that there are absolutely NO adult jokes hidden beneath words so all kids can watch all the scenes because they are very understandable.
There are hundreds of characters spanning from bunny's to lions to naked giraffes. The main characters (Bunny and Fox) have to work together to sort out an animal scam going on.
The story line for this film is absolutely perfect in many ways. The characters are funny and there is a lot of adventure. The comedy is just grand. The sloth scene was just hilarious, people in the cinema couldn't stop laughing for a good few minutes, even after the scene ended. Kids all ages will enjoy this film.
The part where a few animals go savage is a little bit scary. My sister screamed. (Age 8) But other than that there are almost no inappropriate, scary or crude scenes or references during the movie.
To conclude this film is a great family friendly feel good film of the year. It is no doubt one of the best animated film of the decade and it will most likely be popular for a very long time.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Talking to a friend who was keen to see this adaptation after reading the book,we both decided to skip it due to the absolutely kicking it had received in reviews. Meeting a family friend over the weekend,I got told that the film (the book of which he has not read)was much better than expected,which led to me deciding to take a gamble and get on the train.
The plot:
Losing her job over alcoholism after her husband Tom has cheated with Anna Boyd, Rachel Watson starts having black-outs which leave Watson unable to remember what's happened. Keeping secret that she's been sacked from her flatmate,Rachel takes long train rides to pass the ""work time."" Taking a train which goes straight pass Tom and Anna's (who has just had a baby) house,Watson starts looking at Tom's neighbours Scott and Megan Hipwell,who appear happily married.
One day,Rachel catches Megan kissing another man at the house.Horrified at her ""perfect image"" being broken,Watson jumps off the train to confront Megan. Binge drinking before the train ride,Watson faints before reaching Megan. Waking up in her apartment covered in blood and bruises,Rachel finds that she can't remember how she got home,as Rachel learns that Megan is missing.
View on the film:
Getting on-board during early stage of her pregnancy, (kept secret from cast/crew!) Emily Blunt gives a blistering anti-Femme Fatale Film Noir loner performance as Rachael. Dimly looking at the ""perfect"" couples across the tracks with eyes caked in black,Blunt superbly unseats the staggered nature of the Noir loner, pouring Watson out in bitter blends of over-confidence in protecting her ""perfect"" images,and a Noir pit that lands Watson with harsh reality. Joining in this prime cut ""Women's Picture"" Neo-Noir and also taking a liking to twitchy Justin Theroux's Tom, Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett give excellent performance as Anna and Megan,with Bennett making Megan a bundle of sexy Neo-Noir temptation, whilst Ferguson fractures Anna's suburban, picket-line fence image created by Rachel,to release the bubbling Noir Fury.
Changing tracks from the London setting of Paula Hawkins's book to New York,the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson corkscrews the thrills for a simmering Neo-Noir atmosphere. Dovetailing fragmented flashbacks to Rachael going off the rails,Wilson presents with a sharp clarity the slurring state of Rachel,lit in sudden turns of aggression and a tense piecing together of her ""forgotten"" train ride. Opening the bottle to Tom's various relationships,Wilson cuts into an evil under the sun Noir mood, shining from a subtle, gradual changes in perspective,seeping a crisp Noir awareness under the nails of Anna and Rachael.
Buying a Noir Thriller ticket for the first time in his credits,director Tate Taylor & cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen stylishly tap at the burnt Noir loner state of Rachael with grubby low-lighting opening the blackened,decayed wounds of Rachael. Backed by a shimmering score from Danny Elfman,Taylor layers the darkness with chilling stylisation of slow-motion rain hitting the frosty tracks,and screams from a horror-like nightmare linking Rachel's torn ticket memories.""If you were a fan of Zack Snyder's Man of Steel then you will definitely like this movie but this can be a controversial film to non- comic book fans or with mainstream fans, especially with this version of Batman. This version of him is very similar to Frank Miller's Batman from The Dark Knight Returns, an older & war-weary Batman. Overall, I love the film. To me, the story was masterful, dialogues were great (thanks to Chris Terrio), the visuals was absolutely stunning, and the Easter eggs was awesome. By the way Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman stole the show, she was astounding. Ben Affleck's performance is superb, to me, he is the BEST batman to date.""Tell that to my friend who's 8 year old son died that day during the day. Same guy that also had daughter lose her leg during that bombing. I have several other friends that were there that day that saw the bomb go off from a relatively safe distance. The fact that you knuckleheads piece together various bits of (mis)information and concoct stories rationalizing why you believe it was a hoax is utterly ridiculous and extremely offensive to those people who were injured/died and to their families.
Get a life conspiracy theorists.
The movie was relatively well done. It started a bit slow as I thought it was going to be very predictable but about halfway through, it took some turns that kept you on your toes. Being from Massachusetts I typically love Boston based movies. And this does not disappoint. It was probably my favorite Boston based movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In a ""Zootopia"" type world, a broke Koala (played by Matthew McConaughey) runs a broken down theater and gets the bright idea to hold a singing contest to generate interest in his failing business. The prize: $1,000 (mostly in trinkets that comprise McConaughey's meager possessions). But his secretary, an old Chameleon (the funniest character in ""Sing""), accidentally prints out fliers that says the prize is $100,000, and before the mistake is found, the fliers spread throughout the city ofummmthe city of ""Sing.""
Among the hopeful contestants are: a shy, teenage elephant; a mother of dozens of piglets; a porcupine trying to make it as a solo act; a sleazy mouse (or small rat); and a young gorilla who is looking for another life beyond what his gangster father is offering. Together, they will endure hardships and craziness that will either bring their lives up or have them crashing back down to their bleak existence.
My most memorable, movie moment of ""Sing"" is the funny and heartbreaking scene of McConaughey washing cars for money. Stripping down to his underwear, he soaks up car wash soap into his fur and writhes against a car, removing not only dirt but every ounce of his pride and self-respect.
""Sing"" is a movie the entire family will like. It's not one of the best animated movies (roughly half of the jokes are a bit lame), but it does offer memorable covers of famous songs and enough fun to be enjoyable.
Mannysmemorablemoviemoments""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Sing was just absolutely FANTASTIC! My mum said that it was one of the best films they have ever seen and my dad is a CRITIC. I can still not believe some of the actors singing voices like Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy/Ted) as Mike the mouse. I never knew that he could sing that well other than a few family guy episodes. He is absolutely brilliant.
Back to the film, I never got bored throughout the whole film as there was always something going on. I saw it in VueExtreme a couple of days ago and it was just amazing. The bigger screen and better sound made the singing just that much better. I would say it's for all ages.
The characters stories were just so well thought out. Like Johnny, with him having to be in his dad's gang even though he just wants to sing. Or Meena, who just wants to sing but gets so scared. At first I didn't want to watch it, thinking it was just another one of those crap kiddie films, but boy I hugged my friends for inviting me after the film ended. So, even if it doesn't look good, go and SEE it because you will be surprised.
To conclude, if you DON'T enjoy this film than SHAME ON YOU as it's probably the best animation I have ever seen other than maybe Despicable me 2. It's for the whole family and including parents who will love it just as mine did.""The estranged brother (Casey Affleck) returns to hometown because his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges) is suddenly parentless and needs a legal guardian. There's also an unsolved story with ex-wife (Michelle Williams).
This is the third movie of writer-director Kenneth Lonergan who has previously made ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000) and ""Margaret"" (2011). I actually liked both but nothing prepared me for this kind of quality work.
Well, nothing except having only heard good buzz, and having read that the project has won 132 movie awards already (out of 156 nominations). No info on Academy Awards yet, but Affleck already got a Golden Globe for the role (best actor in drama).
But even more importantly, the movie is strong in every conceivable way. Directing, subtle but passionate acting, slow thoughtful mood.
The story is about being unable to cope with loss, just like it often is in real life  without eventual enlightenment or relief. If you push the grief down and hide it, it never really gets a chance to resolve and go away.
And sometimes one doesn't even want the grief to go away because it has become such an important experience, a real part of you. You couldn't even imagine yourself without it.
It's not flashy. During some of the more pivotal moments, such as the one seen in the picture abova, I almost wished it was flashier. But there's no doubt that the result is a powerful and moving. You will probably get misty-eyed. I know I did. But I'm easy that way.
I am pretty glad that Matt Damon didn't star in this because of the scheduling conflict and let Casey Affleck do it instead. I mean, I love Damon, but without him stepping down, we would not know how good Ben's younger brother can really be. And he does not have this bad voice anymore either!
The other cast is good as well, of course. Michelle Williams is one of the best American movie actress of her generation. Sadly, she does not have a big role here.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I saw this movie yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. If you are a dog owner/lover, it's definitely worth a look. It has heart and the story arc is well done.
*SPOILER BELOW* Be prepared for a good cry and not necessarily at the end. Since this is a movie about dog re-incarnation, the dog is killed multiple times and each time is different. You will shed a tear depending on your experience with losing a pet. There are times it might rip at your guts so be sure to bring something to wipe your eyes.
Despite the controversy surrounding this film, I would suggest to forget all that. Just go see it. It's worth it. No point in depriving yourself of such a wonderful experience especially since the TMZ video is basically fake."Yet another occasion that I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics. This film had everything in it for me and Will Smith once again showed what a fantastic actor he truly is. It has a great cast of award nominees (including Dame Helen Mirren) who make this film a real roller-coaster of emotions. Each actor having their own unique part to play giving the film great depth. This is my first ever review on IMDb and it's because I enjoyed the film so much and I believe the critics got it so very wrong on this occasion! I felt I had to stand behind the film and great actors to prove this is not the underdog of films but can stand side by side with many great films."*** This review may contain spoilers *** This film is a left-wing wet dream. Not in the sense of the modern left, but rather the rational Hitchensian left.
At times it was almost unbearably politically biased (Noam Chomsky day? Jesse Jackson '88 shirt? Criticising westernism while romanticising easternism a la Buddhism etc?) and at other times it demonstrated ignorance and inconsistency on the part of the writer(s).
One such example was the numerous criticisms of capitalism throughout the film even though this family was technically an anarcho-capitalist family unit, for example the way they made money for essential supplies (bus fuel, weapons, etc) was by creating trinkets and oddities in the wild from the natural resources and then selling them (ie classical bartering systems) to the closest town's department store.
Obviously the writer didn't pick up on this. I did.
This film was a romanticisation of non-American ways of thinking at the expense of American systems such as capitalism, traditionalism and religion, while it ignored the simple fact that America is one of the few countries left on Earth where you could truly live like this. Though anarchists and libertarians might point out that this way of life is becoming harder and harder to live out, due to the size of the government. In many ways this film represents the last of the classical liberals, in the face of the new left, which represents an ideological steamroller. In just a few years from now I think it will be impossible to make a left-wing film wherein hunting animals in the wild is portrayed as anything other than absolutely negative.
This represents in many ways, my own liberalism that I bitterly cling onto. By no means do I dislike this film, regardless of an overwhelming political agenda presented within. Viggo is always brilliant on the screen, every second he is seen, he is much appreciated, as is his whole family unit who are all ridiculously charming. There is nobody to hate here, in the main cast, besides Viggo himself I suppose.
Viggo plays a very unlikable likable father. It's easy to fall into line here and like him unconditionally, but if one reflects on what he is putting his kids through, you begin to resent him. That said, he has mostly admirable qualities of which all of his kids represent in some fashion. Each of his children has adopted one aspect of their father's personality and amplified it within their own. From rebelliousness to nurturing, from strength to wisdom, from quirkiness to conviction.
This entire emotional and political roller-coaster is all paid off by the splendid ending of the film, wherein Viggo realises (after a near-fatal accident his daughter suffers by his orders) that he is poisoning his children's future and gives them up to his wife's parents, their grandparents, who are stable, economically well off Christians. At first they're portrayed as unlikable, but slowly you're exposed to their true caring nature. In a sense this character development resolves the anti-religious overtones of the film.
After this much needed self-reflection on Viggo's part, the family unit eventually decide to meet society halfway and live on a rural farm with a bus that comes every morning to take the kids to school. By the end the family has sacrificed nothing of their old life which was steeped in physical survivalist training, dense literature and responsibility but instead has now gained an extra dimension: the outside world.
There are many lessons presented within, both negative and positive, I came away with a greater appreciation for my inner anarchist and skeptic but also had a much more stark understanding of why I lean right-wing on many political issues.
Great cinema overcomes it's political biases, rather than creating a sense of political claustrophobia with it's audiences. This makes you think, then lets you breath. That is essential.
Recommended.""This film drives you back directly to your childhood? Who hasn't dreamed of walking on the Yellow brick road? Who wasn't afraid of the Evil Witch of the north? The song ""Over the rainbow"" has been stuck in everyone's head, even though most of the youngest known it covered by a Hawaian dude. And those slippers, oh my... Every little and grown-up girl wants to have a similar o exact replica! The atmosphere and setting are excellent, drives you to an other dreamy and completely imaginative world. This movie has brought magic to many children and continue to do so when you watch it as an adult. It should be on everyone's watchlist if they haven't watched it already! A must- see for everyone!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After watching the interviews on the special features disc I understood that I had to upgrade my rating for this film, from six stars to nine. In particular, the views of Oscar-winning Thelma Schoonmaker were decisive. Her words, as also those of the other interviewees, were exceptionally positive and persuasive. However, I still don't much like the picture.
It is noted on the internet that much of Scorsese's work addresses Sicilian-American identity, and Roman Catholic concepts of guilt, faith and redemption. His films also deal with machismo, misogyny, crime and gang conflict. Many of them are notable for their depictions of violence and liberal use of obscenity. In general, I find these topics, the vicious atmospheres and anti-ethical climate they generate, to be off-putting and negative. The after-taste is unpleasant. Sin, murder, steal as much as you've a mind to, just confess and Heaven will smile. As long as there's a crucifix above your bed. These values don't appeal. The story of Jake La Motta is remarkable, but not inspiring.
In spite of this, or because of it, Scorsese extracts uniformly great performances from his actors. De Niro was outstanding, not only for his extra 60 pounds; and Pesci and Moriarty were up with him, in the vividly lived-in reality of their roles.
Some comment on the movie's subject, Mr La Motta, seems necessary. As of today, this man is still amazingly alive and well, aged 95. He is reported to have the greatest chin in boxing history. Considering the treatment it endured, his body must have been encased in hardened leather, and his head constructed of concrete. In the extra features interview he was highly lucid, and unrepentant.""I've heard about this movie a lot and it's great to finally be able to see such a cult classic. I do feel bad about not seeing it sooner seeing as how David Bowie died last year and all. I really wasn't that familiar with his music, but did know a lot about this movie. What else can you say about two of the most famous creators of all time, Jim Henson and George Lucas collaborating to make a movie? Oh, and their products would both eventually be owned by Disney. Probably the best thing about this film is how amazing the visuals are. There is much creativity put into these backgrounds and puppets.
I will admit that the scenes with the blue screen aren't done that well. The story's a little silly, but it's still great to look at. I don't know how a lot of this stuff happens. Why do all these rocks suddenly appear and attack the guards? It's certainly awesome to see. The final battle scene is very well done with great ideas and lots of fun action everywhere. I love how David Bowie himself just keeps popping in and out of the movie. Obviously, he is great to watch and it perfectly shows off his style. Watch it to remember him or just to see a good movie. ***""Apocalypse Now was released in 1979 and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The movie is about a Vietnam War soldier named Captain Willard who is assigned with the task of hunting down one of the best known officers, Colonel Kurtz who has been presumed to have gone insane. This movie takes a metaphorical look at the war instead of just plainly displaying everything on screen which makes for a more interesting experience as it has many more layers and much more depth to it than what appears on the surface (much like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). There are numerous scenes with stand-out metaphors, some of which are even acknowledged directly by the film itself, for example the scene at the beginning with the fan seeming to represent the rotors on the helicopter, and these thing help build up what this film is. Lighting is also commonly used as a metaphor which was interesting. Every member of the cast gave a brilliant performance; Martin Sheen was great as the lead character Captain Willard and his character and his mind was given lots of depth, as from my viewpoint all of the metaphors are created inside Willard's mind. While his appearance was brief, Robert Duvall was great as Lieutenant Kilgore and showed a character who had experience but was strangely enjoying war unlike most which made for a unique character. Marlon Brando gave an amazing, eerie performance as Colonel Kurtz and his character was very well-written; you could see where he was coming from and what his motivations were and also the look into his fractured mind was haunting. Also, the supporting characters on Willard's boat were also great and you could connect with each one individually and they all felt like real people. They also had great chemistry too. Another thing that I believe adds to the film in a way is that it was as much of an apocalypse on set as it was in the actual film; Martin Sheen suffered from drinking issues and had a heart attack which delayed production, Marlon Brando didn't arrive to production the way the director wanted him to, multiple sets were destroyed before they got used and also Coppola struggled to find a satisfying ending. The production was massively delayed from weeks to over a year and Coppola reportedly threatened suicide multiple times due to the stress and how he thought the movie would turn out terrible and would end his career. Most of the time, a troubled production can have major effects on the final product (Alien 3 for example, however the Assembly Cut does significantly improve it), however all of these real issues contributed in a positive way to the film in my opinion; there's a scene where Willard is suffering from post-traumatic stress and goes mental in his hotel room and during the scene Martin Sheen was genuinely suffering from effects of his alcohol troubles and I feel if these issues in real life didn't happen then the film would be quite different to what it turned out to be. I find this film interesting because of, like I mentioned earlier, instead of it just showing war how it appeared on the surface, it goes much deeper and shows the way it is depicted in the human mind; the entire film is told from the perspective of the human mind (seeing as the entire film is a flashback) and would be viewed as the impact the events had on the mind instead. I believe that this is the most effective way of showing how damaging war was because it shows the events from the inside instead of the outside which makes them more understandable and it really did prove to me exactly what war can do to someone psychologically. Overall, this was an amazing, psychological war film which is much more than what it appears, with amazing performances from the cast and also many haunting but effective themes. I would highly recommend this film. 8.8/10""I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'War Dogs'. I had put off seeing it for a while. The trailers hadn't really done a lot for me. I'm a huge Jonah Hill fan, but Miles Teller I could take or leave. Todd Phillips in the director's chair is almost always a sign of quality though, so I knew I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I finally got around to it tonight and now I regret waiting so long. What a great movie.
Firstly, it finds the perfect balance between comedy and drama. If anything it probably leans more towards the dramatic side of things, however there are plenty of laughs, mostly thanks to Hill's terrific comedic timing. Secondly, what I had feared might be a bit of a bland story actually works very well. It's simple enough to appreciate and never strain your brain over, yet complex enough to be fascinating due to it being based on a true story. It reminded me a lot of 'The Wolf of Wall Street', simply minus all the sexuality that film contained.
I can see the argument being put forward that none of the characters were likable, but it's not a film that's ever trying to make them likable either. The film doesn't need us to root for them, it simply wants to take us on their journey. Other than that I can't see a lot of areas that you could poke holes in this film. It's well-directed, well-acted, well-written and just an all around fun time to be had.""The movie is simply superb, looks like if the things are happening really in front of the eyes. Excellent direction, superb acting and awesome script.It is a movie which is so captivating because of the right mix of comedy, thriller, suspense,romance and drama.
Some of the scenes in the movie are very intense with some very funny moments. Overall it is a no non-sense movie, without any unreal actions or stunts. It has a very real ending with very interesting and twisted plot in the end. Non verbal communication is very important part of communication is getting correctly depicted in the ""El secreto de sus ojos""
It is a must watch movie.""I could never watch this film again. Not because it is a bad movie (I think it is superb), but because I would be subjecting myself to the human pain expressed in it one more time. Hillary Swank, who has proved to be one of our best actresses, plays a young woman, biologically, who sees herself a boy and begins to live that sexual role. We don't know for sure what the future is, but we do know that there are people out there that are willing to kill another person over their sexual preferences. Swank plays a heroic person who tries so hard to embrace what a male would be, even to a dangerous level, that the ugly forces of society can't wait to take her down. There are scenes of the most brutal violence I've seen. The film is masterful in its portrayal. Would that it weren't. Swank's complexity of character is the hallmark of this film.""AAmir Khan At its best he deserves an Oscar for his perfection in role playing. IMDb rate it 9.8 it truly deserves. Aamir Khan sir was made for acting in movies.
Plzz Ignore this what i have written in bottom lines because of IMDb rules there should be 10 lines to submit your review so here it is
The other is a strong feminist statement about girls being the equal of boys, if not better, in an area they've never been seen, let alone accepted. When Mahavir steps into that tricky arena, he is derided and ridiculed: so are his young female charges, as well as their mother (Sakshi Tanwar) who could not bear sons.""I just re-watched this movie. I loved it when I was a kid and I love it now. It is a wonderful movie to watch, especially around Christmas time. The movie is a bit cheesy at times, but you have to remember that this movie is targeted at kids, so I don't hold that against it. The music is fantastic as well. I bought the sound track because I enjoyed it so thoroughly. I enjoyed reading the books when I was younger and seeing the books come to life in a well done manner is great. I look forward to sharing this with my kids one day. Also, it helps that Liam Neeson is in this film because I generally enjoy his movies. Finally, who doesn't love a movie that has talking animals?""John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.
The movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.
If I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the ""semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses"" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, miseenscènes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.
While Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.
Speaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.
I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I seriously can not wait to watch the sequel for this. There are so many things I love about this film, I don't know where to start. I love how this movie came out of nowhere and Just kicked everyone in the backside. Reeves is intense and you can just tell he is loving every minute of it. The world building is an extra bonus. The only thing I didn't like about the film is the final fight scene. Other then that, hats off and great times for all. The film is about the son of a mega boss killing the dog of Keanu Reeves and Reeves taking vengeance. This movie has the action, moves along great. The dialogue is the magic behind it all. Keanu Reeves is such an underrated actor because he does action flicks people love to watch. I'm just happy to see him owning his craft.""John Waters' 1972 cult classic ""Pink Flamingos"" is among the most reviled, infamous, and daring films ever made. Waters pushes the boundaries of the entire art of cinema, forming a film as disgusting and shocking as possible. Many have both praised and harshly criticized this film for its explicit X-rated gross out content, and it has grown to become one of the most talked about cult movies of all time.
Many people have claimed that this film is very ""disturbing"", but I am going to have to disagree. There are highly disturbing concepts portrayed in the film (incest, rape, murder, cannibalism, eating literal dog sh*t, etc.), but the film itself does not take itself seriously in any way. To be perfectly honest, I was having too much fun to be disturbed while watching this film, not because I'm a sick pervert or anything, but because this film is really damn funny! The fascinatingly bizarre characters, the ridiculous over the top acting, the quotably strange lines of dialogue, and the satirical edge all work together to make this film more than just a filth fest-but a masterpiece of dark humor. Never before have I seen such a sick and vile film that has a playful self awareness and almost celebratory vibe.
However, I will admit that there was one scene that genuinely disturbed me: the infamous ""chicken scene"". I have witnessed many gruesome acts caught on camera and it takes a lot to make me legitimately concerned, but that chicken scene is actually shocking. The fact that it is all real is indescribably f*cked up. I will warn animal lovers that that one scene may trigger some extreme outrage and sadness. However, this took place years ago and at least the crew made use of the dead chicken by cooking and eating it afterwards.
Anyway, if you are willing to watch something unbelievably filthy that is injected with extremely dark humor, ""Pink Flamingos"" is certainly the way to go!""Sacrifice, that's the price of a good trick. Actually, from the very beginning, the screen script has all told us how the two trick were played. Change the cage and bird into the box and magician, then there comes the answer. I am shocked by the skills used by Nolan, a genius director. Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. This movie also taught me that if I want to do something very hard, I must have my own way and prepare for it for a long time which is also seen in the movie ""Now You See Me.""""I don't get how I came across this movie so late?! Its just brilliant! The way it plays out, the story, the editing! And the soundtrack. Oh, the music that accompanies DeFoe's scenes!
The acting done by the two leads is brilliant, Norman of course made it big in TWD much later with Flannery getting some recognition in Dexter. But damn. William DeFoe . He stole the bloody movie. Whether it was his narration of the scenes, his constant ragging of the one inspector, which was just LOL, or his climax scenes. Yes you know the one. Brilliant movie. The style, the cutting, the pacing of this movie. They really made them different back in the day. By different I mean better. Perfect movie for a night with take out.""Every so often a film comes along that inspires me to overcome all challenges and energizes me with an almost divine zest for life. Unbroken is one of those films. It's heroic without being campy, it's tragic without being grotesque, and it's historic without being too detailed. It depicts the worst human suffering through true story; a story so overburdened with pain and trauma that most filmmakers would make it unbearable to watch, but somehow Angelina and the Coen brothers manage to keep it highly engaging the whole time. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who are suffering from the worst illness of all: privilege. It's a punch in the face and a reminder of what matters in life.""""The Handmaiden"" is a deeply romantic story full of erotic tension, but also a highly intelligent thriller. It is told in three parts, with countless conspiracies and turns. Everything that you think you know, will turn out in an unexpected way.
But not only the story convinced me. The visuals are outstanding and the general look of the film is close to perfection. That is cinematography at its best. The music of the film is fitting and contributes to the great atmosphere.
The only weakness of this movie are its overacted and sometimes silly male characters. But the main focus lies on the two female protagonists, who are convincing.
For me, this film is a must-watch for fans of Asian cinema and everyone else, who is into new exciting ways to tell great stories on the big screen.""- I watched this movie in the theater and loved it. I don't know if it was the Abba music that made me love it, Meryl Streep, or the love story.
- When it came on TV, I thought I am going to watch it again and see if I was just in a weird mood the first time I saw it, and maybe it won't have the same impact on me if I see it again. However, I LOVED IT the second time even more.
- I have since watched that movie 4 more times, and loved it every time.
- Some people criticized Brosnan's singing. I thought his singing was fine. It wasn't perfect but it made the movie seem more realistic - not everyone in real life sounds like Micheal Buble or Frank Sinatra.
Bottom Line - This is one of my favorite movies of all time.""If you, like myself, have started to become bored with the ""Zombie-Fest"" the film companies have given us, from the remakes of George Romero's classics to Zombie Nazi's to World War Z, then this is a great big breath of fresh air... or not (you'll get that joke once you watch the film).
What you get here is the classic opening and cause for the Zombie plague, a group of falling stars which changes the chemical make-up of the air. The change forces the population to become Zombies, except for one particular blood group... these are our survivors.
Along the way you get their stories, an army with a suspect mission, a mad professor with an insane plan to help the human race, and the next generation of Zombie. Even though all of this has been done before in other films, the vigour with which the director, Kiah Roache-Turner gives the film, and the twists to the ""Zombie Myths"" which the writers, Kiah and Tristan Roache-Turner, add give this film and the particular genre a much-deserved kick in the arse.
The actors were great and did a fantastic job on the characterisations. I especially liked Leon Burchell as Benny, who blows a guys head off to find he wasn't a Zombie, to which he runs over to the corpse and shouts, ""Is he okay? Is he gonna be okay?""
The first time I saw Barry, the main hero, I wasn't too sure of his character or the actor playing him, Jay Gallagher. I was wrong about my initial opinion on the character and actor, as his story is one of loss, anger, revenge, and growth, and shows what kind of psychological journey you would take should the Zombie Apocalypse occur.
Bianca Bradey did a wonderful job of portraying Barry's sister Brooke, who is a strong, intelligent, take-no-crap, woman. Frank, played by Keith Agius, is a wonderful character who has a great depth to him, the scene in the stalled truck is brilliant. The mad professor is greatly over-acted by Berynn Schwerdt making him a wonderful psychopath.
This film is so chock-full of so many different things, even genres, comedy, action, thriller, with horror being the main genre and I was grateful that the horror feel stayed throughout. I was waiting to be dismayed when it all eventually fell apart. Like watching a plate twirler, you're expecting a plate to fall and smash, and once that happens usually all the other plates follow. When the end came and the credits rolled, I was wearing a big smile on my face, thanks guys for a great film.
I caught this as it aired on Film4 though now I'm looking to pick up a copy so I can throw it at my friends while screaming, ""WATCH THIS!""
This is a MUST WATCH for any Zombie-ites out there.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I set myself a target every year to watch every single film that wins and gets nominated at the Oscars, I had watched the other four nominees in the Foreign Language category, I saved this Hungarian film, the winner, until last. Basically set during the Second World War, Hungarian-Jewish Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig) is a prisoner in the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz, he a member of Sonderkommando, forced under pain of death to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims. Saul and the other members know that the prisoners they are enclosing in showers are going to their deaths, the members' work consists of disinfecting the gas chamber after use, going through victims' personal possessions to find valuable items, and disposing of the ashes after the bodies have been burned. One of these gassings however sees Saul pulling out the body of a boy he is convinced is his son, the Germans want to perform an autopsy on the body, but Saul manages to steal the body and avoid this happening. Saul wants to give his son's corpse a proper Jewish burial, he is looking for a Jewish rabbi to preside over the burial, he tells other worker prisoners what he is doing in the hope that they will assist him. Saul finds out that many of the worker prisoners are trying to smuggle out information about the atrocities of the camp to show the world, in order to begin an uprising against their captors. The other Sonderkommando members see their task as more important, and there are many moments when Saul may get stalled or caught, including in the indoor and outdoor crowds of other prisoners, but then there comes a point when the usefulness of the working prisoners for the captors may be coming to an end. A riot breaks out, S-S guards are attacked and the rebellion starts, Saul and a group of prisoners are able to escape, he carries the body of his boy, but he is forced to let it go in the current of the river. In the end Saul and the prisoners find a shed in the forest, they rest to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance, Saul notices a young peasant boy outside, they smile at each other, the boy runs away and guards pass him, in the direction of the shed, gunfire echoes through the woods and the boy walks away. Also starring Levente Molnár as Abraham Warszawski, Urs Rechn as Oberkapo Biederman, Jerzy Walczak as Rabbi Frankel, Sándor Zsótér as Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, Marcin Czarnik as Feigenbaum, and twins Gergö and Balázs Farkas as Saul's Son. It has been seventy years since the events of the Holocaust, Life Is Beautiful and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas are examples of films that have successful made a fictional but realistic story using a concentration camp, this film proves that there is still room for a new film about this subject. It is simply watching the life of a working prisoner of Auschwitz over a two day period, but what makes this film really clever is that we only see what the character sees, the shocking exterminations and hundreds of people confined and suffering seen from the point of view of the lead character is much more powerful, it is intense and harrowing, but a respectful and magnificent wartime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Unlike DePalma's 1983 remake, the 1932 original has a run time half as long. Additionally, the setting of the original being 1920's Chicago during prohibition makes more sense for Tony's gangster character than the 1980's Florida cocaine boom. Tony Camonte is a dark, driven character who stops at nothing to be in total control. He competes with rivals for business, territory, power, and even women. Two elements of this film that particularly stood out to me were the cinematography and the sound. At the beginning of the film, the sound and camera work together to create an ominous murder scene. All the viewer hears is the sound of Tony whistling as he walks down the hallway. The camera follows only Tony's shadow as he creeps along. Finally, we hear gunshots ring out and light flashes as a man falls and Tony's shadow exits. An additional brilliant use of sound was in the killing of a rival gang leader at a bowling alley. He begins his back-swing and is shot as he releases the ball, thus the viewer hears the gunshots as the camera follows the ball bowling a strike. Lastly, a predominant symbol in the film was a sign outside Tony's apartment that reads, ""The World is Yours."" He gazes upon it multiple times over the course of the film as his success and confidence build. As he meets his demise at the film's end, the camera pans up to this sign, a last bit of irony."*** This review may contain spoilers *** One of the best works of mark. It has exceeded my high expectations for by a mile. The emotions are thoroughly felt through out the movie.The irony of beloved ones turning into strangers and the desperation both the characters show and their struggle to stay together is very touching. The animation is lagging in some scenes but the overall movie is one of the best i ever watched. The good thing which gives warmth to the heart is that in the end both of them finally met each other. The ending for his other works like 5 centimeters per second leave a person with tears but this movie has it all. I would recommend this to every anime fan and also to those looking for a movie full of emotions."I didn't expect to like the movie so much. The best I was hoping for was a ""tried and tested"" movie of the father-saves-daughter-from- bad-guys type. Boy was I wrong.
Not a single minute of screen time, not a single script line is wasted, everything is there to help the story move forward and make the audience understand the characters and the motivations behind them. This results in a movie that has a very good feeling of ""motion"", something that so many movies fail to achieve and instead feel boring and repetitive. Kudos to the script writing team.
The visuals are fantastic. Everything has a gritty tone to it that feels right in place with the story the movie wants to tell, supported by one of the best casting I've seen. Every character shines on screen, it's as if the roles were written for them specifically.
This is a movie full of confidence, and it shows in every scene. I don't get why it's rated so poorly (I would rate higher if IMDb was accepting 0.1 points). One of the best movies of 2016!""First off, don't watch the trailer! If you're a fan of Korean cinema and modern zombies, just get straight to the film. The film has several genuinely good 'Oh my god' eye-budging moments for the viewer and they spoil some of those in the trailer.
The film truly captures the stress, and anxiety of a WWZ zombie scenario. You agonize over the vulnerability of the survivors, especially when there's no Zeds in sight. It gets going fast, builds the characters surprisingly well considering they get little exposition, and kinda just keeps going on full steam for 2 captivating hours.
It's not exactly all on a train, either. That premise put me off slightly as I thought it might get a little stale, or perhaps they were on a budget. But no, there's more to it. And even one or two original ideas, believe it or not.
This film takes no prisoners. It's brutal and sad, but somehow keeps a certain charm. It has the most adorable child actor - who performs brilliantly imo - and whilst she's a weaknesses for the survivors, never feels like a burden to the story. You will be rooting for them at the teary end.""this animated film is a masterpiece one of the best I have ever seen truly magical cannot say enough about it , and won't tell you the story summarised ,
to avoid spoiling the story..
All I can say is that this film transports you and make you feel like in Japan, I actually had the chance to live 5 years in Tokyo in Minatoku area shown on the movie Arisugawa Coen actually (arisugawa gardens neighbourhood) and this masterpiece not only transports you to Tokyo but a small town in rural/traditional Japan and a magical small town that brought me many memories of my excursions to small lost towns close to Kyoto and Nara, the combinations or life realism and magic , spirituality the depth and yet simplicity both at the same time of the story makes this work a truly masterpiece that for me deserves to be among some of my favourite films such as the Godfather, Kurosawa movies, first old Lucas Star Wars, Cinemaparadiso and so on ..
An unexpected wonderful surprise and for me a masterpiece God thanks they still make this masterpieces like this still nowadays this work sets and has a quality of its own, it is a rare almost extinct type of quality , soul and magic you hardly ever see nowadays.. wonderful script and story too..
I LOVED Kimi no na wa. A must see !
Ernest From Barcelona Spain now Living in Switzerland""I have only recently seen this movie, and been wondering why I have not really come across it earlier - and it seems that it has just not been promoted and praised enough.
It's a shame, since this movie is highly entertaining, stylish and funny, sun-drenched and full of action, all with a wink in the eye. The 60's aesthetics and music are just irresistibly stylish and classy, and especially the forced collaboration between American spy and master-thief Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and his Russian antagonist and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer, donning a charming Russian accent) is both hilarious and heartwarming. In their midst is German girl Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), which causes much extra espionage chaos and some romantic sparks flying. It's a true Guy Ritchie movie with all the music, lightness of foot and style that these usually provide. Also, there is some dark-humoured violence and sarcasm, which is what viewers have loved since Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels.
My personal big minus is that Alicia Vikander's German (she is Swedish), is so bad, that I as a native German had trouble understanding her - but since Brit Henry Cavill is playing an American, and American Armie Hammer mimes the Russian agent, that is to be excused. Playfulness with nationality seems to be a thing here.
If you are looking for an entertaining, action-packed, cool and (plot-twists ahead) exciting movie, this one is it.""When the movie begins, you'll quickly think: ""what am I seeing?"". But as you continue watching it, you will understand you are watching an incredible metaphor of the real world. You will have moments of silence, complemented with an original soundtrack, apparently moments of non-sense (you will realize later it totally makes sense) and Colin Farrell changing during the movie. After the movie, you will understand you are one of the characters everyday, when you wake up and go to work. It's a quite disturbing thought, as you will see the plot is quite twisted, but I would say it's an excellent portrait of nowadays and how the relationships are build. Highly recommended.""This movie is in line with The Machine, Ex-Machina, and Humans (TV series). Similar to those three, it has a certain subdued ''British'' feel to it without it being an actual British movie, and not quite being on the same level. However, it is - in my opinion - an extremely good movie in spite of what some reviewers mentioned. First of all, the ''electronic'' music is sparse, and only adds to the coldness and spookiness of certain moods when it is there. One reviewer raised a list of questions that were apparently unanswered in the movie. I answered all of them. I won't list every single one, as this is not a ''reply '' to his post. Suffice it to say that, yes, the movie does explain why one of the people in Morgan's entourage got stabbed in the eye. Kate Mara is excellent in every way, as is Anya Taylor-Joy. The rest of the cast - except for the Chinese doctor perhaps - alas, pale in comparison. Some people criticized the ending. If you ''expect'' a typical Hollywood ending, you'll be disappointed. If, however, you're accustomed to the European, Asian, or Philip K. Dick type of endings, you'll be rewarded. 8/10 for me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I saw Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING last night, and I was blown away by its imagery, its lead performance, story, and scares. No one could have been a better Jack Torrance than Jack Nicholson. He's very believable when he's sane and insane, showing growing insanity from cabin fever and boredom. While he was good in Batman, this proved to me how far and how great his talent could go. Stanley Kubrick's direction is very focused and his use of the soundtrack and cinematography adds for a powerful impact on the viewer. I also really like the symbolism of the ghosts from the ball event of 1921, and how they represent his inner demons getting the best of him. That image of Jack with the members of the ball at the end I think is supposed to symbolize how the ghosts won him over, accomplishing their goal of bringing out the worst in him. The story is filled with memorable events. Who could forget the two girls saying ""Come play with us Danny,"" or Wendy looking at all the pages of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,"" or Jack saying ""Here's Johnny!"" Shelly Duvall isn't the best fake-crier, but she's not Tommy Wiseau bad and is tolerable. I thinks it's cool how the hotel is isolated from the rest of the world, so there's no other way for help other than that guy coming in at the end which didn't go so well. And of course, it's pretty scary. While I was the right age to watch this film, there's no denying its intensity. The score ,Nicholson's performance, and the imagery add a lot to the horror element. It knows how to keep you engaged and want to see the whole thing, and never fails to disappoint. If you haven't seen it yet, you're really missing out on something special.""An incredible true story. Given the justice and portrayal it deserves through beautiful cinematography, acting and story telling.
The two young Indian boys are magnificent the youngest especially who did not start learning English till after filming.
The opening hour or so uses minimal dialogue but harrowingly beautiful well shot scenes and cinematography to highlight the intensity of a child going missing, the deep loneliness and the need for survival. As well as emphasising the uncomfortable reality of childhood poverty and missing children in India.
From there the film builds on this unbelievable true story. Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman once again at there best. Highlighting the mental strain, the anguish and emotional drain caused when the story behind Dev Patel's character eats away at him, testing the family's relationship.
Despite this seemingly depressing plot the film fills you with overwhelming feelings of love and happiness, for life and family. Along with gratefulness for what we have and the desire to help those less fortunate
Free up 3 hours of your day and go and see this film. You will not be disappointed""This film differs from a conventional western because of the costumes they wear not quite like the westerns of the fifties, and also the unusual scary, primitive savages. Also you must have a strong stomach to see all the gory scenes. But what makes this film above average is in the excellent choice of actors , dialogue and screenplay, which starts reminding one of ""The Searchers"" but with completely different characters. Kurt Russel as the sheriff, Patrick Wilson as Arthur, Richard Jenkins as Chicory and specially Matthew Fox as Brooder are excellent, including Lili Simmons as Samantha adding beauty and class to her role.""This tragic WW2 story of the Czech resistance and assassination of hangman Heydrich has been told before on screen. The story is so good that it deserves this new version. There was an old miniseries from the 70s or 80s Operation Daybreak that was well made but Anthropoid has far more exciting battle sequences in the Church with new filming techniques of today. Also the on location shooting in Prague makes things seem realistic. The torture and tragic battle at the end are quite harrowing.
The actors are all good. Jamie Dornan blends in well and shows he doesn't have to be typecast by 50 Shades. Cillian Murphy is always a mesmerizing actor - here he doesn't dominate which is good. The cast all try to put on Czech accents which lends authenticity to the movie but sometimes it's hard to get all the dialog. Doesn't matter though the story doesn't rely on the dialog. A little more follow up about the fate of the protagonists good and bad at the end would have been a welcome epilogue.
This movie deserved a wider audience and showing at the box office. It's kind of sad that a movie like Allied because of big names and marketing is more widely seen than a real war movie like Anthropoid.""""Milk"", directed by Gus Van Sant, is a biopic of the first openly gay elected official in the United States, Harvey Milk. Set in 1970's San Francisco, this movie is filled with both hopeful messages of the gay rights movement and also emotional trials for Harvey Milk and his community.
In a strategic move that sets the scene as Harvey Milk being a martyr for the gay community, the film opens immediately with the fact that Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco have been assassinated. Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, opens the movie with a flashback to a recording of himself discussing the possibility of his assassination for his supporters the people around him as a member of the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. This recording is cut in and out of throughout the entire film, with Harvey discussing many of the things he accomplished and also the many difficult times he faced. Milk, originally a relatively closeted insurance seller in New York City, is shown picking up a younger man in a subway station and ultimately share an intimate sexual scene. This man is Scottie Smith, played by James Franco, who ultimately becomes Milk's partner and eventual campaign manager. This scene is intimate, casual, and almost a lighthearted juxtaposition to the seriousness of the opening scenes about an impeding assassination. The movie continues on with Harvey and Scottie in San Francisco, with Harvey transforming into a bearded, camera store owning, openly out, resident of the Castro district. There are countless scenes of the lives of Harvey and Scottie and the surrounding happenings in the Castro eventually lead to the politicization of Harvey Milk. This change in his character is closely linked to the scenes of bar riots and corrupt police in the city during this time. The movie is focused mostly on the campaign and leadership of Harvey Milk, with many empowering scenes of gay pride, speeches of hope, and intimate moments between Harvey and his lovers and peers. Harvey's relationship with Scottie eventually comes to demise, and his struggles with this can be considered a major part of the plot of this film outside of the obvious political movement that is clearly the focus. The second relationship that is portrayed in this movie is with Jack, another man much younger than Harvey that comes knocking on his door looking for help with his psychological and drinking problems. Ultimately portrayed as unhealthy, this relationship is on Harvey's mind through many major moments in the movie while Scottie seems to have distanced himself. The final acts in the movie are scenes where Dan White, a fellow councilman, assassinates both Harvey and the Mayor. His motives are not made clear, and historically are also inconclusive, but the scenes are very ""Hollywood"" and include dramatic elements that are more than likely not as historically accurate as other parts of the movie. The assassination act itself is not a focus in this movie, with the scene only really lasting about ten minutes out of the entire two-hour film. Nicely wrapping this film up is the stunning display of the vigil that took place in San Francisco in honor of the victims of the killings.
Overall, this movie portrays Harvey Milk and the ear of gay liberation in an extremely positive and tasteful way. Sean Penn's Milk is incredibly powerful and ensues the heroic qualities that Milk in real life surely had in order to lead these sorts of movements and protests. That being said, there is a bit of an issue with how big the role of this one man is made to seem in this movie. There is a lack of understanding of the community that was already in place in San Francisco when Harvey and Scottie arrive there, as it almost seems like Harvey Milk is the only reason that anything political really took form in this community, when really it was the work of so many men and women trying to get rights for themselves and their peers.
The portrayal of Harvey and Scottie and Harvey and Jack is also something to be questioned about regarding the historical accuracy of this film. While the portrayal is arguably a positive one of homosexual relationships in comparison to the negative portrayals often seen in Hollywood, it is important to note that this is romanticized for the purpose of the viewer, as there are discrepancies on how these relationships went in Harvey's real life. I would argue that this is not super important to the portrayal of Milk as a man, it should be noted when critically looking at this film.
""Milk"" overall can be taken as an honorable movie about an extremely honorable man. A biopic that is beautifully shot and scripted to be more historically accurate than many other movies take an attempt to reach. This film has ""normalized"" portrayals of gay relationships and the gay community in general from this time period. The added elements of movie making that went into this sort of Hollywood production should not take away from the overall message of hope and love, that surely Harvey himself would want to be taken away from this story that ended so tragically.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am big fan of tom cruise n i have watched most of his movies n all r entertaining, but Jerry is that kind of movie which not only entertains you but also makes you feel good. Tom cruise was the perfect choice for jerry maguire, i can't think of any actor in that role,, tom cruise is always considered as the best good looking actor who he is but , but i like him for his acting,, his acting in this movie is so believable, funny , goofy and whenever he shouts, yells , in movie not only entertains cuba gooding jr. but us also. i had always watched tom cruise as an action star before watching jerry maguire cuz i watched this movie 20 yr later its release. he should have gotten an Oscar award for this movie, which he really deserved. the other cast of movie were very good. cuba gooding is funny at times. the coordination between him n tom cruise in this movie is so good that it makes you feel like you are watching real people talking. renee zellweger is also quite good in her role, the screenplay is very entertaining n doesn't make u feel bored , the cinematography, dialogues, Direction of cameron crowe. Cameron crowe is a great director and whenever he n tom cruise works together its,they always bring good movies....""When I first got this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I'm not a huge fan of war based movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gone With the Wind was a beautiful movie that so clearly showed the devastation of the Civil War and how during the Reconstruction the Southerners had to adjust to the abolishment of slavery. Although there are racist undertones and many of the African American characters are stereotypes, one has to take into account the time the movie was filmed and released, and the time it is depicting. The romance element of the movie helps keep it interesting, and the movie perfectly balances romance and the Civil War aspects of the film. All in all, this movie was amazing and I can see how it is one of the greats.""Just watched with my girlfriend, who falls asleep at every film we watch... she didn't fall asleep during this one.
Kept on the edge of our seats for 2 hours, with the film playing you out like a flute. Would recommend to anyone looking for one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen.
Side note: After the film, my girlfriend just went to the loo, so I hid in one the rooms opposite, waited for her to finish and walk past the door before I JUMPED OUT ON HER. Think she soiled herself... funny as hell.
** DO NOT READ THE SPOILER ALERTS **""10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and collectively written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. It stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Music is by Bear McCreary and cinematography by Jeff Cutter.
Michelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...
From the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.
A key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...
Superbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise Goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5/10""Wow. That was unexpected. I seriously thought this was going to be another Happy New Year/Dilwale-type typical SRK garbage as usual of recent times and had absolutely zero expectations from the same old same old trailer... But damn it I couldn't for once able to take my eyes away from the screen! This is an ideal example of a more or less predictable plot risen to a whole different level by its precise brilliant direction, gripping engaging screenplay, taut fat-less editing, a great suitable background score, and everything combined with an awesome larger than life but balanced screen presence & complex character portrayal by none other than Shah Rukh Khan (how glad am I to say that again after all these years!) Actually all the hugely talented cast was absolutely excellent! A rare perfect mix of fulltoos entertainment and solid quality in my opinion. Maybe not on the same league as modern Hindi gangster classics like Company or Omkara or Maqbool, but definitely another blood-pumping fun ride like Once Upon a Time in Mumbai or Sarker. 9 out of 10, A-.""Let's get one thing straight, Forrest Gump is spectacular!
Tom Hanks delivered one of the best performances ever. His performance is the best thing about this picture. The movie has a very deep message and anyone at any age should enjoy it. The story told is like no other and is a very great one that touches the viewer, motivates him and affects him in many ways. Definitely worth of being a classic and one of the best family movies.
But the reason why it is overrated is that it won six Oscars the year Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction came out, the two so-called best movies of the 90s and in my opinion both of them are better than Forrest Gump. I definitely understand Hanks winning best actor, but best picture over Pulp Fiction and Shawshank? As usual the Academy got it wrong.
But this does not stop Forrest Gump from being a beautiful movie.""After his major success with the 1999 psychological horror-thriller 'The Sixth Sense', M. Night Shyamalan, an expert of suspense and supernatural twists, appeared to have a promising career ahead of him. Following his triumph with 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs', Shyamalan sorely met a downward trajectory in his career with a long string of cinematic duds that failed to demonstrate the firm potential of his filmmaking talent. After the vast disappointment of 2013's 'After Earth', movie fans everywhere grew pessimistic about his career ever resurfacing. His career finally saw a small shade of heavenly light when he directed the 2015 found-footage thriller 'The Visit' which marked a moderate comeback. This psychological thriller however, shows Shyamalan returning to the supernatural genre in his most valuable form with psychological twists and mind-bending thrills. Echoing his notable works, this film strolls audiences through a dark, mysterious vehicle where expectations are challenged and minds of viewers are effectively played with. This film follows three teenage girls: best friends Claire (played by Haley Ru Richardson) and Marcia (played by Jessica Sula), and social awkward outsider Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) who are abducted and trapped inside a basement cellar by the hands of a psychopath (played by James McAvoy). He isn't no ordinary psychopath however, he is a man who suffers from dissociative identity disorder (meaning he carries 23 different personalities). The girls must outsmart him in attempt to escape before suffering by the hands his 24th and his most vicious personality yet -- The Beast.
M. Night Shyamalan is veteran for crafting smart, spine-tingling vehicles that challenge the minds of viewers and spear them with twist endings that that are nearly impossible to see on the horizon. That is until his long string of cinematic debacles began trailing on his career. Here, Shyamalan has made a triumphant return and mingled in a superbly crafted plot with a solid assortment of spellbinding thrills and engaging cinematography that echoes Mike Gioulakis's work in 'It Follows'. The story cuts back and worth between James McAvoy's chilling interaction with the girls, and his relationship with his therapist (played by Betty Buckley) who plays a vital role throughout the story. The former however, easily marks the story's high points. The cutthroat atmosphere is enticingly generated by a chilling performance by James McAvoy who drastically alternates between a long series of multiple personalities with pinches of both dark humor and cynicism, and the battle of the minds between his character and the three teen girls rolls with plenty of startling twists. As part his trademark style, Shyamalan is a director in favor of not repetitive jump scares or drenching the atmosphere in relentless blood and gore, but instead using a thoughtful narrative to toy with the minds of viewers. And his methods greatly pay from the start to the climatic final act when the suspense and thrills goes on full throttle, to an ending that will raise some eyebrows. If this film has any blemishes, it may be the underdevelopment of the female characters portrayed by Haley Ru Richardson and Jessica Sula as opposed to Anya Taylor-Joy's character is the only one of the trio assembled in a three-dimensional state. And there are some occasional instances of dialogue that comes off rather cheesy. Overall, M. Night Shyalaman crafts for a superb experience where these flaws can be effortlessly overlooked.
Split is provocative, spine-chilling psychological thrill piece that not only scores for an engrossing experience, but also marks a triumphant return for director M. Night Shyamalan in his career. In a large pile of January-released duds, this film truly stands out among them. Needless to say, it proves that 2015's 'The Visit' wasn't a just a fluke.""'The Departed' is by far one of my favorite films. It is truly, in my opinion, some of Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio's best work. Very articulate and keeps you guessing what will happen next. 'The Departed' is actually one of the films that made me finalize my decision to become an actor. The performance between the characters truly brought the film to life. It has a brooding storyline that will keep the viewer interested. The cast is very broad and is very top notch. Some of the best actors are in this film and it definitely puts it in my top 5 favorite films. I definitely would watch this film again and recommend it to anyone that is a true film addict. The whole of this film is truly a masterpiece.""I saw that film before 5 years. I hasn't see filM from Quentin Tarantino. Now,after five years he is my favourite director and the Inglorious Basterds is my favourite time. I have see this movie 10 times. I Love It. I hate Nazi so i love the type of violent which i saw in this film. Waltz was amazing in this role. You love him and you hate him the same time. The dialogs are very interesting. I know Some people don't love the violent. But Quentin Tarantino makes you to love the violent. My favourite scene is in the bar. This scene makes me laugh... One other scene which i love is in cafe. The dialog between Sosana and Hans was amazing. Every word, every feeling is perfect. For me is the best film from Quentin. I Hope one day to make another film like this.""There seems to be a movement afoot to diminish ratings on films, even if they are reasonably good. So someone looks at the 250 best films list and rather than actually review and give any sort of subjective review, they give it a one so they can sabotage the rating. This is a charming movie. It's not for everyone, but it is creative and kind and has a wonderful love story. Criticize a away, but to call a person with a desire to do good, even if she invades the spaces of people, a psychopath! Really. I guess that's the curse of the public forum. For those actually interested in the movie, it involves a young woman who has been sheltered by her parents. When the mother is killed by a falling body, she is left to her own designs. Her father is cold and disinterested and she must fend for herself. She becomes an observer of life and begins to formulate her own being. Her decision making is based on her personal journey and, in some cases, a lack of real education. She is a waif but only wants to do good. One of the most creative and loving movies ever produced.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Glory is an incredible story in every way. Told through the upbringing of the 54th regiment of the Union Army, the story enriches the viewer by giving them a first-hand look at how the first wholly African American regiment came to be. With powerful dialogue and provoking scenes, Glory shows how the comradery was built between the white men and the black men of the regiment. There were certainly speed bumps along the way, however. This upcoming was no straight and easy path. For example, Colonel James Montgomery does not make it easy for the men to maintain their dignity when they burn down an entire innocent and defenseless town. The character development in the movie is just lovely. Thomas, the son of a freedman and a freedman himself, learns that he isn't above anyone and must learn and fight just like the rest of the regiment. Silas Trip, a rather mischievous man, learns to strap down and be a good soldier. In the end, Trip takes charge when Colonel Shaw falls. This story shows how men were able to overcome their differences and fight for a common cause. This movie warmed my heart and I would recommend it to anyone as a 10/10.""Usually, historical movies have to take some amount of artistic freedom with the story to keep the film interesting. ""The Free State of Jones"" did a very exceptional job when it comes to historical accuracy. After reading up on the actual Jones rebellion I can confidently agree with many of the other reviews that this movie almost perfectly recounts the events of the real rebellion. From a film standpoint it is also wonderful, intriguing framing in combination with sparingly used gore and violence hint at a much bigger conflict than what is being shown on the screen. Gary Ross did an outstanding job with this film and I am glad to have chosen to watch it for APUSH.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There's a scene in Hidden Figures in which Al Harrison, the harried NASA administrator tasked during the early 1960s with getting an American into spacequicktells his staff of scientists, mathematicians, theorists, and engineers, ""We all get there together or we don't get there at all."" He's speaking not about ego or seniority or degrees of education, but about the integration of an enormously-gifted African-American woman into their ranks.
Although that line of dialogue, as spoken by actor Kevin Costner as Harrison, is inspiring enough to have been prominently featured in the television, radio, and computer advertising for the picture, there's really nothing particularly special about Costner's delivery of the line in the moviethe words are spoken with some authority, but also fairly quietly, almost conversationally, without any emphasis.
And that's one of the most likable aspects of Hidden Figures, the new 20th Century-Fox/Fox 2000 motion picture about the early days of the US space program and the importance of three very special people to the project's eventual success in landing a man on the moon. NASA was during that time very much a man's domain. The story of a handful of uniquely-gifted women who were able to gain entry to that exclusive territory is inspiring enough. That some of these women were African-American during a time of segregation and oppression makes a great story even better.
With the possible exception of the three women whose story it depicts, Hidden Figures is populated by characters who are sometimes flawed and eccentric or motivated by their own narrow personal agendas, but united in a mission to navigate the impossible, and in the process invent an entirely new branch of science.
In this way, Hidden Figures is refreshingly a movie about integration and civil rights in which integration and civil rights are almostbut not quitesecondary to a crackerjack story about exceptional people during exceptional times.
Katherine Goble, played by Taraji P. Henson, is an intellectual prodigy whom since childhood has grasped advanced theoretical mathematical concepts as if God Himself were her tutor. A shy, reserved, and bespectacled widow and mother of three, Henson plays the role as if segregation is an unfortunate and irritating inconvenience which only serves to distract her from her primary scientific passion.
Mary Jackson, played by model and recording artist Janelle Monae, is a research mathematician and physical scientist who yearns for an education in engineering. The mother of two and married to a civil rights activist, Mary is more career-oriented, determined and irreverently outspoken than her friend Katherinethe word sassy springs to mind. Unable to pursue her educational degree in a state where scholastic segregation is still legal, Mary ultimately takes her ambitions into a courtroom and challenges the law.
Dorothy Vaughn, portrayed by the wonderful Octavia Spencer, is the most philosophically-canny of the three friends, seemingly willing to compromise with segregation for as long as it doesn't interrupt her plans or career path. A mathematician assigned because of her gender and race to a secretarial pool, Dorothy finally employs subterfuge, and even a humorous little piece of larceny, as a means of gaining the information she needs to operate the new room-sized IBM computer NASA's experts don't even know how to turn on.
Registering the most impact among the supporting characters is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison. As played by Costner, Harrison is so consumed and obsessed with his mission of placing an American into space that he's virtually oblivious to the world and society which surrounds him. A consummate professional, the gruff, humorless Harrison needs the best scientists in the country to help him invent the new science required of his missionno matter their color. Harrison is a fictional character, an amalgamation of several different NASA administrators, and Costner plays him perfectly.
Also notable is actor Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn. Although he does not bear even the slightest resemblance to the astronaut, Powell easily captures Glenn's million-megawatt charisma and charm. When the IBM computer's trajectory figures appear shaky, Glenn insists Goble personallyhe calls her ""the smart girl,"" the cardinal plaudit in Glenn's vocabularycheck the numbers before he climbs onto the rocket for his launch into history. It's a charming, little-known detail to an American legend, and it's absolutely true.
Theodore Melfi guides Hidden Figures with a loose and relaxed hand, wisely allowing the story to unfold naturally, in its own time. He essentially lets the story to speak for itself. While the viewer never gets the sense that actual historical events are unfolding on screen, it's a consummately agreeable history lesson. is so fascinating to others.
Hidden Figures takes more than a few liberties with the facts, but the filmmakers will be quick to point out that the picture is not a documentarythe words projected on screen at the beginning of the movie read, ""Based on a True Story."" As Americans, we sometimes seem to hobble ourselves, and move forward only with great reluctance and deliberation. And even accounting for the progress we achieve, often after a period of enlightenment we take a step or two backward and build walls of mistrust instead of bridges of understanding.
While Hidden Figures is being described accurately as a ""feel-good picture,"" at the time of the historic space mission of John Glenn which concludes the picture, the fire hoses and police attack dogs shamefully used during the historic civil rights demonstrations of Selma and Birmingham were still a year or so in the future.
So as we're patting ourselves on the back and congratulating ourselves on how far we've traveled since that time in the early 1960s when Kevin Costner's character in Hidden Figures tells his newly integrated staff ""We get there together or we don't get there at all,"" we might also want to be mindful of how far we still need to go.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Mastermind Scorsese created this neo-noir thriller fueled, not just with the unleaded Travis's busted leased cab needs, but also with some of the (raw-est) acting I have ever seen.
Seemingly harmless Marine Vet Travis Bickle, having issues sleeping takes up a graveyard cab shift to help him pass his meaningless hours. This cabbie takes a liking to a young desk clerk campaigning for the upcoming presidential candidate. After losing her interest by taking her to see some ""Swedish smut film"" he becomes obsessed with being part of her life. Losing ""the girl"" pushes Travis deeper into isolation, and a loneliness that he cant even express to his cabbie friends.
During the Film Travis progressively loses touch with society, and decides to take the responsibility of cleaning up the slums of New York. De Niro, envelopes this sense of a ""hero's innocence"" when his character justifies his paranoid, and violent actions and evokes a feeling mental instability that truly deserves the Oscar he won.
Regardless of the year this was released, this film is truly one of the greatest Film-Noir movies ever made. From the opening sequence, to the last ""So long"" , this movie is a masterpiece .""I'm amazed this scored so low! Whether you like Will Smith or not, this has everything you could ask for.
Some notes for consideration: This was a movie that faced some serious adversity from the beginning.
The script for this was written in 1996 which makes the film all the more intriguing knowing just how many directors were cycled through before it finally went into production (11 years later!). The title alone started out as ""Tonight, He Comes"" followed by ""John Hancock"" and then simply ""Hancock"". Even the desired rating of PG-13 was a struggle to acquire, as the MPAA had twice already dubbed it ""R"".
But after all was said and done, Hancock took the #1 spot after opening weekend with mixed reviews (41% Rotten Tomatoes, 49% Metacritic)! With a production budget of $150 million, after opening weekend it brought in $185.6 million after the opening weekend worldwide (5 day weekend).
Now on to the actual content:
The script is refreshing. Not only are there twists throughout, but they are highly unpredictable and start to expose themselves within the first 30 minutes.
The cast consists of Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman whom all demonstrate outstanding performances (as one would expect from them). The humor is believable and not overdone, the drama is the perfect amount leaving you laughing and feeling sorrow throughout.
As mentioned before, even if you are not a huge Will Smith fan this will surely be something anyone can enjoy. I am quite puzzled by the general consensus here on IMDb but assure you that the film is much better than the rating would infer.""First of all, let me express my deepest sorrow because this movie is not in IMDb's top 250, but that's only my opinion. Secondly, to explain my thoughts and feelings that I have written beforehand, I love this movie because it contains everything an action movie should have, a hero, a supporting hero, horrible villains, a fair maiden, fight scenes and most of all that deep strong and manly warrior emotion. Of course, everyone who might be reading this and hasn't watched it has my highest recommendations to do it, boy or girl, old or young you will not be disappointed. To conclude I will just say that this is the only move that made me cry, and yes, I watched Bambi when I was a kid :D""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Saving Private Ryan has all the ingredients.
A good story - A young paratrooper, Private Ryan, is dropped into the confusion of the D-Day airborne landings. Unknown to Ryan, his three brothers have all recently been killed in action.
The commanding general orders that the last surviving brother must be located and returned home. A small squad of rangers, led by Hanks, is despatched into the Normandy countryside to find Private Ryan and get him to safety..
Dramatic battle scenes - Spielberg sets the style which has now often been copied for graphic and realistic battle scenes. E.g. 'Fury' copied the style but had a rather silly ending. Saving Private Ryan, although a fictional story, much of 'gore/battle scenes' recreate eye witness accounts, so is very realistic.
Great acting - Tom Hanks, Matt Damon Vin Diesel and the cast all make this very, very believable.
A fully satisfying, quality war film with a great and poignant ending.
Up until now I was unable to think of a war film that was comparable in all departments - Story/Realism/Acting.
However, having just seen Hacksaw Ridge I think that just 'pips' Saving Private Ryan, if only on the basis Hacksaw Ridge is also a true story.
Saving Private Ryan is a classic war film that can be watched many times. 9/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Park Chan-wook is already a legendary filmmaker in pretty much every circle and he's only 53 years old. With films like the original 'Oldboy', 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance', 'Thirst', and 'Stoker', it's easy to say that Park Chan-wook is a master of his domain and film. Fortunately for everyone who loves film, his new movie 'The Handmaiden', based off 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters is not just a film, but an experience in cinema and will be forever etched in you memory for all the right reasons.
In 'The Handmaiden', Park Chan-wook has perfectly conjured up a mix of a 1930's drama, comedy, horror, suspense, and a bathtub full of sex and tentacles. Most filmmakers would have a very difficult time making a classy artsy film with these subjects, let alone, combining all of these aspects, but Park Chan-wook has done it effortlessly. Set in Korea in the 1930s, a suave crook named Count Fujiwara has hired a young woman named Sook-hee, and has trained her to be a pick-pocket and con- artist, in order to make the mysterious, strange, and very wealthy Lady Hideko fall in love, in order to taker all of her jewels and money.
Sook-hee goes undercover as Hideko's new handmaiden in order to help her fall in love more with Count Fujiwara. Something unexpected happens when Hideko and Sook-hee end up falling for each other, much to the dismay to Hideko's sadistic black tongued uncle. There are so many layers to this film and each of its characters that during the 145 minute run-time, you get the story basically three times, told in different perspectives, with each new look, revealing a darker and more sexual side to each character and compelling clues to the ever going mystery of just what is taking place at this beautiful estate.
Needless to say, it isn't all puppy dogs and beautiful flowers. With some of the darker images and actions that take place in 'The Handmaiden', Park Chan-wook uses his camera in a very elegant way and never in a harsh movement, making every bit of debauchery or lovemaking seem innocent. 'The Handmaiden' is one of the better films in a long time and there is absolutely no other film like it.
MUST-SEE!""This movie does not deserve the hate it apparently has gotten is my first line.
We all have had or still do have that friend who is so blind to see that he is a puppet under an over controlling and abusing girlfriend. And this movie hits those notes perfectly.
It is an perfect comedy with that theme. And yes it's a hilarious movie, anyone who tries telling you anything else is either lying or has a heart of ice and stone. Or simply doesn't have any humor.
So do yourself a very big service and watch this movie about love, friendship and just some crazy jokes and actors.""I just watched it. And I am speechless. Its the best sci-fi movie I have seen since Intersteller.
The main driver of the film is the Story of the film and the director has done an amazingly perfect work on the story. Next is the Hero/Villain of the movie - Suriya. I have been a fan of Suriya after I watched his movie Masss. Suriya is an amazing actor. Since he is playing 3 different roles in the movie, a person watching the movie just forget it and feels like those 3 are all together different persons. I think thats make him an outstanding actor.
About the movie. The movie is gripping from its first scene only. You cannot skip a single scene. I didn't understand the songs of the movie because I am not South Indian but believe me they are all sounds really good as the composer is AR Rahman. The man has given an amazing score to the film. During the movie there are so many twists and turns that you cannot predict and explains the quality of the movie. I will not say about the ending of the movie, you just have to watch the movie for it.
MY RATING - 10 STARS Go and watch it. Don't Skip it at any cost. This is the best Sci-fi Movie India has ever produced.""An incredible film not just classic war scenes in the world Actors who have used scenes for the first time have never really He's nice. Films spend an emotional time for war scenes To follow and make happy. The players do not have much better movies, so the movie can be considered as bad. Film and acting. Also, the scenes are sometimes bored I guess. I guess it's for you to breathe a little. Because he is very excited. Have fun Sit back and enjoy the movie.This movie is not just for one nation. So please do not come close to or ignore events that are happening in the world.In the name of people just living peacefully Good looking and good fun""Greetings from Lithuania.
""The Handmaiden"" (2016) was without the doubt one of the best movies from 2016 I've seen. This is a multi-layered story which involves - love, sex, cons, mystery and a little bit of violence. Before seeing this movie i kinda thought it would be slow paces story which will probably involve all above mentioned things, but boy oh boy surely i wasn't prepared for how this movie is great. If anything else, this movie isn't slow paced - at running time 2 h 15 min. it is a brilliantly crafted highly involving story. Directing, writing, cinematography were first rate as well as acting and set design. The story itself was very intriguing, but its the brilliant movie craftsmanship that made ""The Handmaiden"" into one of the best movies I've seen whole year (2016).
Overall, ""The Handmaiden"" is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys great films (but not for the youngest ones as it shows some explicit sex scenes). It is a very beautifully filmed story, not predictable or boring for a second (!) and a highly involving one. Brilliant picture.""What did I just watch? So Ill start out by saying that THIS should have been movie of the year. It should have cleaned house, not Birdman. David Fincher rarely ever disappoints. The cinematography had an overwhelming dark and creepy feel to it. The plot was rich and suspenseful. Not only was I surprisingly impressed with Ben Affleck in this film but the entire supporting cast did a tremendous job of selling this tense set of circumstances. A great insight into a twisted mind and the things people are capable of. Although it was long, ""Gone Girl"" will take you on a roller coaster ride that keeps you engaged and constantly guessing. I'm going to give ""Gone Girl"" a solid 9/10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In general great plot and acting. I was expecting some bad pronunciation but Morrison exceeded all expectations. He shows what kind of great acting skills he has in this movie and the feeling for life in the Russian underground world. I think that the social and cultural element of the Russians is portrayed really good and the very clear contradiction between the two worlds of Anna and Nicolai. However, the movie is going into detail on some elements in the beginning while it lacks the real emotions of the main characters. Why did Nicolai join the cops? Why is Kirill so aggressive about his dad (something happened in the past) What did he find in Nicolai that attractive.. is there an emotional connection? (there is a hint about him being gay). I liked the movie for the 90 minutes that it fed me, but I've loved to get a lot more details and a better ending. It felt like they just cut it off in the end.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This film was one of my favorite films growing up as a child. Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down hits close to home as I grew up in Fort Campbell, Kentucky home of the 101st Airborne division. Mostly all of the people involved in the incident were from that base including my father who served in Mogadishu, Somalia. I remember seeing the film as a child and being blown away with the visual effects and sound. I have always been keen the quality of film. Meaning cinematography and sound editing have been one of the most important parts of making a film and Black Hawk Down hits the nail on the head. Scott has always been an amazing film director and he always manages to choose the best cinematographers and film editors on the market. With this film winning two Oscars it has proved to be one of the best war films ever made.
When it comes to cinematography and film editing, it is the most important element in a film. It can seriously make your film or damage it. I have seen films like Open Water or 50 Shades of Grey (or 50 Shades of Crap) that had poor editing and camera work. In the film Black Hawk Down, the camera work is above par. The brilliant movement makes the viewer believe that he is actually in Mogadishu. And with its Oscar winning editing the film makes you believe that you can actually be getting shot at. As a Marine Corps combat wounded veteran it is very difficult to watch films that can trigger flash backs and unwanted dark memories. There is a reason I don't normally watch war films. But this film has always been a classic for me and my family. The story is not as beautiful as one would want but it is beautiful how the camera makes it. War can sometimes be beautiful. It was sad to see people you knew get injured so severely. But I guess that's what drove me to joining the armed forces. I love to fight. And the will that was presented in this captivating film only gave me the inspiration to fight for my country as well. Yes, films are inspiring whether they are real or fake. Ridley Scott has taken a true life disaster and turned it into Hollywood magic. One of my favorite scenes is the scene where Josh Hartnett's character Eversmann is trying to save his buddy's life in some make shift table. The soldier was shot in the leg. The bullet hit a main artery and his attempt to stop the bleeding makes the viewer believe that he is actually in the room as well. The camera does a magnificent job in producing a realistic environment for the viewer. This is what real cinematography and film editing is all about. Making the viewer believe.
In conclusion, this film has changed my life. With the decisions I made as a young Marine, this film has played an influence on how I wanted to carry out my Marine Corps career. With balls of steel. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to watch this film and also to be affected by the film to this day. The camera work and editing has motivated me to either go into cinematography or editing as a career. Scott continues to influence people around the world with amazing directorial skills. One can only be grateful to catch a glimpse of his work.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** An ordinary Lego construction worker, thought to be the prophesied 'Special', is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the Lego universe into eternal stasis.

With beautiful animation, hilarious jokes and a big adventure for both kids and their parents this Lego movie perfectly catches the spirit of how a 'LEGO' Movie can be both funny and entertaining at the same time if it gets made right and has the right people behind it. The voice cast is pretty spot on and Chris Pratt alongside Elizabeth Banks bring a lot of great entertainment plus Will Arnett makes a pretty good voice for a Lego Batman and his upcoming film gets it's release next week also Will Ferrell gives one of the best performances of his entire career since Elf, some of the cameos were pretty good also with the best being the Star Wars one with Han Solo and C-3PO.

It has sex, it has guns, its American, It has a Brittian actor, a Spanish actor. The nominated actors and lots of legends featuring in this movie.

Outstanding job on the filming, even better on the story line. Great job on this movie. 10 of 10 Baby ;)""Continuing my plan to watch every Mel Gibson movie in order, I come to Braveheart (1995)
Plot In A Paragraph: William Wallace (Gibson) begins a revolt against King Edward I of England, after his wife is executed for assaulting an English Soldier who tried to tape her.
I love this movie, it takes a while to get going, we don't see Gibson for over 20 minutes as the movie takes its time showing his early years. But once it gets going it's a sweeping, gripping epic movie.
Brilliantly acted, as well as directed, One of the best compliment I can pay this movie is it doesn't look like a Hollywood movie, it's locations for example, look green, but very muddy and very wet!! There is so much in this movie that is deserving of praise, but it's the battle scenes that stand out in this movie!! Once they start, they are often violent, bloody and very graphic!! But it never feels like shock gore (as so common now a days) it feels appropriate and it makes the world feel real.
It's even more impressive when you consider this was only Gibson's second movie as director!! It's interesting to note Gibson didn't actually want the role of William Wallace, as he felt he was too old, however Paramount would only finance the movie (With a $53 million budget) if he would star in it.
If there is a criticism of this film it is how it handles the love affair between Wallace and Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau), at 3 hours long, the movie didn't need to be any longer, but they meet, they're in love, she's pregnant, she's gone. It's all so rushed and it takes a little away from it all.
Braveheart didn't do as well as I thought, at the domestic box office, grossing $75 million to end the year the 18th highest grossing movie of 1995. I thought for certain this would have topped $100 million domestically!! But as I scrolled down the list, looking for where it ended amongst the years top grossing movies I was very surprised to see it so low, as I thought it would be amongst his top grossers.
I'm sure the lack of box office returns was made up by the fact that Gibson won two Oscars, one for best director and the other for best movie for Braveheart.""Striking a truly impressive balance between engaging the mind, the heart, and the heart rate, Inception is the first movie since The Dark Knight that I wanted to see again the very next day (no coincidence since they were made by the same person). It has been said that Hollywood relies too much on special effects to cover lazy storytelling; not so with Inception, where truly stunning visuals only supplement what you'll really be talking about: the story, what it means, how it moved you, and how shockingly original it is. I've never seen anything like it, either in concept or in narrative structure. Neither have I attended, in a long time, a film that gave my brain such a workout.
This is a movie that expects you to pay attention and make connections. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heartbreaking performance, leading a cast of top-notch actors playing interesting characters in a film that appears to be a science-fiction action/heist caper (a rather unique concept in itself), but is actually about guilt, the desire for redemption, and the raw power of simple ideas. Director Christopher Nolan, as he did with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, takes something fantastic and paints it in realistic tones. This is what unbridled imagination, combined with intelligence, emotion, and talent looks like on film. It is mentally and emotionally challenging. It also has some terrific action (including a physics- bending fight sequence that is jaw-dropping) and is very creative in its use of cinematography, editing, and music. Though comparatively light on language, with no sexual material and action violence where physical harm is not what's at stake (you'll understand when you see it), Inception is nonetheless not recommended for anyone younger than teens due to its complexity and intense subject matter.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** You would have to look very hard to find a more complete movie than this one!
1. It's romantic - and I am not only referring to the love between William and Murron. (And later the short romance between him and the princess.) I'm also referring to the romantic aspect of being passionate about something and fighting for that passion, even when you've already lost everything and have little to no chance of winning! This movie has that and I find that aspect more romantic than anything else on screen! I know that this story is not a correct adaptation of what truly happened (the real story is very different in fact), but it is a very beautiful version of it!
2. It's funny! Despite every horrible thing happening it still finds time to crack some jokes every now and then and it doesn't do it inappropriately. The comedic touches are perfectly fitting and some lines are very quotable!
3. It's about love, family, equality, but most of all friendship! The chemistry between the characters is great! You believe they share a history! You believe their pain and their stories. You feel for them and want them to reach their goals! They make fun of each other and you can see the dynamic between William and his friends and understand why they are friends to begin with. Every character makes sense and there are no caricatures!
4. Every scene is relevant to the story! The story doesn't drag out in order to fill empty spaces with unnecessary scenes or dialogues. As a fan of ""A song of ice and fire"" and now also the TV-series adaptation - I think that ""Braveheart"" is the closest thing you can get (in a currently existing movie) to the feeling you get from watching GOT, so if you're a GOT fan like me - you'll like this movie!
5. It's tragic! Some people don't like tragedy in their movies - but a tragic story is an emotional one, and to me emotions are crucial when it comes to make me care about a movie as much as I do about this one. It makes me cry, it makes me laugh, it makes feel anger and disgust all at the same time!
6. The acting is great! The dialogue's are good, the characters are realistic! Even the English king - who I despise has real human weaknesses, which makes him a very believable character despite his person!
7. It's action-filled! And the fight-scenes are well done and don't look at all tacky as they so often do in so many other movies! I don't like ""modern"" war movies to be honest (they're too current and chaotic for my taste), but I love medieval battles, and I've seen enough of them to know what I'm talking about!
8. The landscape! And the costumes! And the structures! And the overall beauty of the scenery! It's perfect! I developed a sense of affection for the Scottish culture thanks to this movie!
9. It's history! (Although not entirely true.) It teaches us a little bit about what happened and how life used to be around 700 years ago. It's not based on fantasy (although I love fantasy) - it's based on reality! (And I want to emphasize the word ""based"" I because I want to make sure that anyone who reads this knows that I realize that the real William Wallace was far different from his portrayal in this movie. But the essential parts are still true) We owe it to ourselves to remind us of that history!
10. It's medieval! It has got swords, ""knights"" and kings!!! It has got strategy, intrigue, boldness and wit! It even addresses the struggles of being a homosexual in a society that doesn't accept it!
So there you got it! It's an action, war, romance, drama, medieval, tragic, comedy and historic movie about love, passion, friends, family, social injustice and the struggle for freedom and equality! I can't recommend it enough!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Ten it is and well deserved. I have seen this several times and always find something to dwell on. Of course, Peter O'Toole was superb, but so was his supporting cast.
Anthony Quinn looks more Arabic than Arabs. And Anthony Quayle always has been a favorite of mine and Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, and Jose Ferrar were splendid. The latter was appropriately dissolute as the Turkish officer who captured Lawrence
The photography was spectacular, the skyline, deserts, and battle scenes. There were just enough of the fighting. The opening air bombing, the attack on the train, the massacre of the Turkish column, and the final raid.
What also was impressive was the relationship between Lawrence and the two Arab boys. All in all, a marvelous production that no one should miss.""This film is bizarre. That is no bad thing either. I don't know that I've ever seen a science fiction film set on a world which feels so completely alien. There was never a point while I was watching Fantastic Planet where I felt, ""Yeah, I think I've got the gist of it now."" Laloux seems to take great pleasure in filling every frame of this film with some new strange creation. The titular Fantastic Planet revealed to the viewer is not some sort of parallel Earth whose only discernible difference from our own world is the presence of some blue fauna. The Fantastic Planet doesn't seem to be a place one could fathom ever existing in the universe. Of course that in no way impedes the story. It only really compliments it. The urgency and curiosity created by such a setting acts as a pretty strong hook to keep you watching. While you're completely invested in the plight of the characters, you will also find yourself constantly wondering what new weird creature might make itself known in the next scene. What higher compliment could there be for a science fiction animation?
To speak of the animation. It's wonderful stop motion that I could see turning some people off to this film. Admittedly, I found it totally jarring for the first couple of minutes. I found though that I got used to it after not very long, and it in no way kept me from totally being completely hypnotized. After having completed the film, I can't really imagine it any other way. It isn't smooth and graceful. Some times it can feel more like a subtly shifting painting rather than a traditional cartoon. Really though, it only makes sense for the story. It's not natural. It's off. So is the Fantastic Planet."*** This review may contain spoilers *** It's a movie where it explains that somewhere love can make your life way beautiful more reasonable and yup gives you reasons to live again or start another day...but sometimes we become really selfish that we don't even think about the person who loves us and sometimes we think are not worthy of someone but that's wrong if someone accepts you with flaws then why wait... why can't we put aside those bad habits and just live for them.... The ending of this film was truly heart breaking and beside the whole film was wonderful and different ....just be ready with some tissues and watch it with your partner because after the ending u probably need someone who can hold on to u"The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.
Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.
There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.
10/10 Absolutely Recommended!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I felt that ""Gone with the Wind"" was truly a great film. It seemed to present the times of the American Civil War in a different kind of perspective. It is such a classic for so many reason but the main reason being the epic love between Scarlett and Rhett. Most people seem to love a great story about an epic romance. The characters in this film are unforgettable and very compelling.Though this movie may not be historical accurate (which I will be researching about) the plot is still very intriguing. For its time I thought that the cinematography was excellent and added to the tone of the movie. Overall, I will never forget this Hollywood classic.""I teared up often during the show. At the end, I got the same feeling I did with other Oscar Best Pictures: this show will win it this year. It's that good.
Aspiring actress Mia comes across as more normal than many of her contemporaries, which also makes her less likely to succeed as she fails many auditions while working as a barista. Sebastian (or Seb) is a jazz- loving pianist who wants to help the genre succeed, but has to compromise by taking on paying gigs that don't inspire him.
As they meet, initial clashes give way to chemistry and they inspire each other to pursue their dreams, but to what ending remains unclear.
There are many levels to the movie, with homages to old and new movie musicals. Dancing and choreography are great, but don't expect Astaire and Rogers. Bright primary colors grace the screen throughout, particularly on the wonderful costumes.
About the only thing I didn't like was the excessive motion and swirling of the hand-held cameras. While our couple are the stars, the music is what holds it all together and makes it the greatest. You will leave feeling inspired and wistful.""Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence, but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the workplace).
The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff. Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to completely orbit the Earth.
With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama ""Selma"" since that too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups. Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama, including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them antagonists) in these women's lives.
Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the present.
The moral: If you put your mind to it, things can be accomplished no matter how many would say otherwise.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Glory was great film and one of my personal favorite Civil War movies. The movie is very entertaining and addresses a chapter in the war that is too often skipped over by the history books. The struggle of African- American soldiers to prove themselves equal to their white counterparts as well as gain freedom for those still trapped in slavery is not addressed often enough. There are minor a few historical inaccuracies throughout the movie, but these can be forgiven as the general theme of the movie rings true. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of history or anyone who is just looking for a good exciting movie to watch.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** True to Bhansali's signature style, this epic love saga, touted as his magnum opus is opulent, dreamy & magnificent. Lavish palaces, mirrored chambers, glittering chandeliers, royal robes & dazzling jewelry  Bajirao Mastani is a richly woven historical tapestry of romance, passion, hatred & conspiracy, all of it veiled in a tantalizing enigma. The film unfolds like an unexplored fable of love between the legendary Maratha general Peshwa Bajirao I & the ethereal half- Muslim princess Mastani. As Rao engages in battles against the Mughals for Chhatrapati Shahu, he is approached by the beautiful Mastani who requests protection for Bundelkhand. In the process, they fall in love. But how will Rao's first wife Kashibai react to this? Will Bajirao's family accept Mastani as his wife & not concubine? Can their love overcome the rigid social barriers & emerge victorious in this battle against the state, family & age-old traditions? Owing to few glitches here and there, Bajirao Mastani falls short of being a masterpiece but it is definitely the perfect tribute to the chivalrous warrior, his gutsy Mastani & the selfless Kashibai. From Bajirao and Mastani's undying passion for each other that transcends all social barriers to their unfulfilled dream of togetherness to Kashibai's unrequited love, everything was beautifully scripted and brought to life by poignant performances. Also, unlike Jodha Akbar, Bajirao Mastani doesn't overlook uncomfortable issues like male infidelity as we see Kashibai questioning Mastani about the reliability of Bajirao's heart. One must also applaud the film's respectable and realistic approach to the issue of bigamy. It doesn't glorify or demean any character to justify its theme. Nor does it give a romanticized version of Bajirao; he is a great warrior & a good man but not without flaws. The triumph of the film's characterization lies in the fact that we feel compelled to empathize even with those who oppose the love story. Whether it is Bajirao or Mastani or Kashi or Ma Saheb, everyone has his or her own reasons and we can clearly see the conflict of head and heart simmering in their eyes. Scenes like Kashi destroying the curtain that reflects the events in Aina Mahal and Bajirao's letter to Mastani stating that Kashibai is both his wife and friend and deserves to know everything stand out. The film's cinematography is absolutely outstanding. Bhansali peppers it beautifully with his rich & fairly well informed vision of the 18th century India. Replete with complex war scenes, panoramic action sequences, enthralling songs, though-provoking dialogues & continuous interplay of light & shade coupled with the clamour of swords & tinkling of anklets  Bajirao Mastani is a complete audio visual treat. Speaking of the performances, Ranveer Singh nails it as Bajirao. From a proud Maratha general to an intoxicated lover guilty of cheating his wife, Singh breathes life into the character. The forever stunning Deepika Padukone lights up the screen as the fiery Mastani who disregards all social norms and believes in writing her own destiny. But somewhere, the intensity in her character is missing & she fails to create an impact. Her style of speech becomes monotonous after a time. Also, the full-blown passion of this pair is missing from the picture. It is Priyanka Chopra who takes the cake here. Her Kashi is grace personified. The transformation from the innocent, vivacious & loving wife to a more mature, muted yet strong lady is flawless. She portrays Kashi's inner turmoil with élan & conveys the quiet sorrow of a wife & friend forgotten. The supporting cast has also done a fabulous job  supremely good Tanvi Azmi (as Radhabai), intense Vaibhav (as brother Chimaji) & restrained Milind Soman (as the faithful Ambaji) were a treat to watch. Though the story ends on a tragic note & the ending could have been more authentic and less dramatized (as far as Mastani's death is concerned), it is surely one of the most well scripted scenes in the film. Bajirao, hallucinating under fever, sees forces charging at him in the river. He wages his own war & goes into the water swinging his sword . He says his opponent is 'bhagwan kismat' thus signifying his lost battle with his fate, family & the custodians of religion. From Rao's slow descent into madness to Kashi watching him helplessly to Mastani's failed attempts at freeing herself from the chains that bind her, you can feel their loss, pain & grief. As the sun sets and the rain pours down, it draws the curtain on a 300-year old tale of love 'jiska zikr na kabhi itihas mein hua na kabhi woh udharan bani'. No running across green meadows, no car chase, no item numbers  Bajirao Mastani takes you to a new world full of untasted delights and does complete justice to its theme 'every religion teaches love but love has no religion and is a religion in itself'.""Neerja Bhanot, a young purser, gave her life in her attempt to save the lives of many dozens of passengers on board Pan Am Flight 73, which was hijacked by terrorists in September 1986. In so doing, she became a national symbol of bravery and heroism. Her story is well documented in this taut, inspiring and heart-touching thriller, which keeps its viewers on the edge of their seats as they witness this female hero fight for the lives of all those passengers who were forced to sit still and watch the atrocity of the four terrorists. Sonam Kapoor is the main lead here, and she makes the best of what many actresses would consider a dream role. This is clearly her best part, and she is very strong in her portrayal of Neerja's selfless bravery on board, as well as her steadfast determination not to succumb to societal mores in her personal life.
The story develops at a fast pace, and is spite of its proceedings being well-known to all, the audience still wishes for a different outcome. Due credit for this would go to the direction, which combines elements of a suspenseful thriller and a strong human drama. It is the ending, however, which is a little too sentimental, but there it's Shabana Azmi's turn to shine and she does as usual. One cannot but feel for this woman and her daughter, but it's always inspiring to see how the sacrifice of Neerja, just as noted in the film, manages to immortalize her, so much that thirty years later a film is produced in her memory, and audiences are running to watch it. In the long run kindness is never left unnoticed. Long live Neerja Bhanot, may her selfless bravery and heroic sacrifice will never be left unrecorded in the pages of history.""What a comeback SRK!!! Take a bow. Best SRK performance after ChakDe. 80's Gujarat is presented so well, every details has been captured so beautifully, all thanks to Dholkia! Nawaz has acted so well as a IPS police officer, reminds me of his role from Kahani where he played the same character! Mahiraa is very fresh and her chemistry with SRK is simply superb!Characters are established in RAEES so nicely that it reminds you great movies like Deewar & Sholay. The action sequences are very realistic & hard hitting.The movie has lots of twist and turns with some unique business tricks shown how selling of prohibited products use to carry out in Gujrat. A must must watch for SRK fans!!!""Aamir does it again. What a movie! From beginning to the end, so many hilarious moments.Screenplay and Direction are fantastic. Full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. Aamir pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. Never for once you feel you are watching Aamir. It was Rancho on screen. Sharman and Madhavan - I just bow down in front of them. Music looks OK on CD but during movie it worked as a plus point. Situational tracks works in the favor of film. Runtime may sound a bit too much but believe me, you won't know when the first half is over, and second half may seem a bit too hilarious, but apart from that its a masterpiece. Great Aamir! Another brilliant movie. 10/10""the films takes in into the real world. i have wondered and I'm waiting for my trip... the love part of this story seems okay. i love travel side, u must watch it. the main part of this film is travel and it watch it or travel purpose only, this might be good feed for travel motivated persons ever like Vera!! the acting of the both character was too good the travel in tempo was good plan but comparing to rich it has some problem, i recommend you to travel in bike! traveling with girl is not possible as like as we think. in this film they did not concentrate with public issues. but look good film everyone must see for traveling thrust. if u seen this your leg will not be stand simply.have good journey""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Thankfully - we have the utter disaster of a movie that was ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" as a baseline for this movie - although I personally found it more in line with ""The Whole Nine Yards"".
Now it's probably no secret that too many people who do reviews take themselves WAY too seriously and seem to think that everyone who reads their review will consider them to have been the center of their universe for a few minutes (newsflash - watch the yelp episode of southpark - that's you - exactly you) - but I kind of expected people to cut this movie the slack it much desperately needs. Reviewers seem to be utterly incensed that this is not some uber slick Jason Bourne effort; but those same reviewers ranked both ""Skyfall"" (the truly first ever raping of the James Bond Franchise) and ""Inception"" (one of the worst movies ever made) rather highly - and really only showing there is no accounting for taste.
This is a lighthearted, funny af movie with an EXCEPTIONALLY solid cast, direction and production. It's let down by some glaringly poor continuity and editing - but that's the only reason I am not giving it a solid 10. Now let me explain something - I cannot STAND Zack Gandalfushallnotpassius or whatever his name is - I still want a full refund for the 1h 30m of my life spent watching him attempt to act in ""the Hangover"" - but he totally owns this movie. Gal Gadot and Jon Hamm are literally two of the best casting decisions made in a movie in a long time. It does not have to be Oscar worthy to be good casting. They are not only polished - but they are believable. They could do with being a bit more ""bad-ass"" but it's hard to say more about that without giving away spoilers.
Isla Fisher was new to me - but I loved her. She's cute and sassy, but carries her character very very well indeed. Second only to Zack - her performance was superb.
This is not a sleek, intellectual thriller - if that's what you want - watch the Odessa Files, or Bourne - or Bond (but obviously before Barbara Broccoli turned it into an utterly crap franchise) - it's not an action packed explosions/car chase filled movie - it's dry humor delivered with impeccable style. Reviewers need to learn how to look at a movie for what it is and review it that way - rather than review it for what they thought it would be like.
Pros: it's slick and moves at a great pace. It has a predictable plot that leaves you with no illusions of grandeur - there is nothing to figure out - this movie does it all for you. Beautifully I might add. Great acting - tons of laughs if you don't expect Katt Williams levels of comedic genius. Gal Gadot in lingerie. Isla Figher In lingerie.
Cons: it's slightly bereft of any really cool action scenes. Having the spies be utterly impeccable would have been a really good idea - but they are kinda just smartish - run of the mill types. Some of the plot line makes very little sense - but this is not a proposition for Wittgenstein - so really who cares if this spy-comedy is a little plot thin? Continuity/editing is awful in one very particular spot.
Totally unnecessary - but utterly welcome extra Pro: This movie has Gal Gadot in it. In lingerie.
Let me restate that: *clears throat* Gal fricking Gadot - in fricking lingerie!! That's an automatic 4 or 5 stars.
It also has Isla Fisher in Lingerie - but seriously people Gal Gadot In lingerie!
I highly recommend this movie. It's a ""lay on the couch with your significant other eating popcorn and drinking red wine"" type of movie. And that's just fine by me :)""I'm a huge fan of W. Bruce Cameron's books, especially A Dog's Purpose and A Dog's Journey. So I came to this movie with high expectations. And it did not disappoint! I think the fact that the author and his wife co-wrote the screenplay, so the heart and soul of the books were in the film. I saw this movie twice, once at an advance screening at Showcase Springdale in Cincinnati with my husband and adult children, and again on opening day at the Rave Dayton South with my dad, step-mom and grandmother. Half of us had read the book beforehand, the other half hadn't. It didn't matter. We all absolutely LOVED this touching, heart-warming, funny film. You will laugh, you will cry, you will laugh some more, and then you'll leave the theatre ready to adopt a(nother) dog. I sure hope they make A Dog's Journey into a movie also.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Qualities of the film and the source material aside, we can't but think about the basic idea behind this story.
A multi-billionaire with no motivations to care about normal people or about the stability of the planet walks into the HQ of WHO. Why WHO of all places? Beats me. He throws around a few simple ideas that all of us have been thinking about for ages. He gets labeled as a terrorist because of PC. Sounds familiar.
And that's when he becomes a real terrorist and the ultimate bad guy whose gruesomeness is magnified even more by the fact that he's actually dead and yet he keeps pulling the strings from his grave like some kind of a Dumbledore. The protagonist has a brief moment when he acknowledges that this multi-billionaire has a point but in the end, he acknowledges that the bad guy is a bad guy. Even the unscrupulous for-hire organization (the likes of which are the source of true evil in this world) which was backing the bad guy for the whole time goes ""Oh my god, we've been backing the antagonist"" and decides to ""save the world"" instead.
In the end, all you are left with is a bitter after-taste from ingesting yet another piece of globalist propaganda.""This is not a movie with deep meaning, a complex plot or redeeming value but was surprisingly enjoyable. The primary characters were not glamorous but rather down to earth which lent a certain innocence and believability. I thought their acting was excellent and sustained the movie through to the end. The bad guys deserve kudos. Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins played quirky drug lords which they pulled off really well in a low key manner. These are often the most difficult characters to pull off in a movie, often being overly done but not here. The secondary bad guys were superbly cast and relentless in the chase which kept the tension level high through the entire movie. Plot wise this was a basic caper gone wrong and chase movie with a surprising twist at the end. Wreakage and carnage on the Autobahn while extensive, was not overdone. In fact, the chase scenes and crash scenes were really well choreographed and not over the top or gratuitous. The only weakness was the ending which was predictable and didn't follow through which left a feeling of abruptness, probably forced through mandatory time constraints. As a result, Anthony Hopkin's character and story did not feel complete. Collide was great entertainment that didn't require deep thought to enjoy....
Comment: the main characters were not ""backpackers"" but rather ex- pats living and working in Germany. Seems to be growing tendency to refer to anyone between 20-30 as backpackers...""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First of Ben Affleck is an older batman and this is the Justice League batman not the dark knight. His take on Bruce Wayne is that of a darker Bruce Wayne how he is tormented about seeing his parents kill. In all other Batman movies this gets over looked. You see it at the start of the movies then its never seen again. SVB goes into the mental side of things.
Superman For the first time a movie gets Superman Spot on. Asking the question ""why do i bother saving these people who go against me? He questions his moral right to save the plant. The scenes That makes it look like Superman is bad or turn bad are spot on.In the comic book Superman dose turn bad because Lois is killed by the Joker.
Movie From the start to finish you know what is going on. In the comics Batman dose not wanna kill Superman. He just wants to let Superman know that if he becomes a threat he can be beaten. Batman is not a killer think of all the villain he lets live. He can never kill the joker for example no matter how much he is pushed. So he is not gonna kill Superman who is not a villain.
Jesse Eisenberg Plays a true Lex. Rich hates daddy and dose not like Superman as he wants what Superman has. Power. Lex is Superman's Joker. He is the link between the two and set everything up. Wanted to see if Superman could kill Batman and corrupt him to show that he is not this all good he has bad in him. (Like the Joker wants Batman to kill him so he can show he is not as good as he says he is and can be bad )
When Wonder woman appears it is not out of place as the film makes sure she is always in the movie so you know who she is. This was not the Justice league this was the start of it . The movie showed all who would be in in the new Justice League movie.
The fight scenes are spot on. Brutal and tough.
It did not cut any corners. People are so used to the Avengers. the one liners that are not needed. The good looking sexy heroes.
If you watch this movie remember its not your typical pop movie and it was not made for the junkies who just want to go see a movie because its marketed every were and hyped up.""This is a movie that really makes you think and value what you have, appreciate all the blessings around you.
All actors played their roles exactly as they should & they've succeeded no matter how long or short their lines were.
Many moments of truth, honesty and sometimes reality that we see everyday around us in different ways. Sometimes we need a ""wake up"" message to re-evaluate what is not running well and get it fixed. Pick the track you want to have in life. Make the best use of your relationships.
Well done all the cast. One of the very best movies ever.""Christian Wolf (Ben Affleck) is an Accountant who has autism. He provides financial advice to criminals who can't use the normal channels to invest their money. He is told to offer his services to a legitimate business as Ray King (J.K. Simmons) of the Treasury Department is hot on his trail. Christian offers his services to Living Robotics who claim to have lost $61-million. Christian with the help of another accountant, Dana (Anna Kendrick), discover how the money was lost, but not really lost, but just reinvested into other company accounts to make the business look more successful to attain more investors. Living Robotics now believe Christian and Dana have succeeded in discovering how the money was ""lost"" and now their lives are in danger. They hire The Assassin (Jon Bernthal) to take them out. Oh, oh!
This is told via flashbacks to Christian's childhood with his autism and the present day with autistic ticks he tries to control. There are a lot of bits and pieces that seem unconnected, but stay with this because it will all make sense later on. The acting throughout is of the highest caliber and in some ways Christian Wolf will make you think of John Wick (the movie with Keanu Reeves) as he goes about killing bad guys.
This is a thoughtful and very suspenseful story and Ben Affleck does, perhaps, the best job of his career ever. An Oscar? Hmmmm possible.
Notables: Jeffrey Tambor as Francis, a prison cell mate of Christian; John Lithgow as Lamar Blackburn an owner of Living Robotics; Jean Smart, sister of Lamar; Jake Priestly as Brax, Christian's younger brother in childhood scenes; and Cynthia Addai- Robinson as Marybeth Medina the young Analyst Ray gets to find out exactly who The Accountant is.
There are 2-twists you won't see coming. You may figure out one of them, but not both. Ray practically tells you one of them but the other one is a complete shock.um, maybe.
This is simply terrific and I didn't want it to end. Pretty sure we will see sequels. Let's hope. (9/10)
Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, but not too much.""I went to see the accountant in cinema as a last minute decision. I didn't read many reviews about it and only heard it was a ""good movie"". I thought The Accountant was an incredible movie! I felt like I got more then my money's worth. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and it held my attention throughout the duration of the movie. I am a big fan of Ben Affleck and thought his acting in it was outstanding. If you enjoyed the Bourne movies you will love The Accountant. The story and plot behind was very well done. It is suspenseful and holds your attention. I would easily give this movie a 10 out of 10 and will absolutely watch it again.""Slapstick silliness, amazing musical performances, and the important message to never give up on your dreams makes Sing inspired fun for any generation.
The day I went to see Sing the theater was filled with an under 10 crowd who giggled and laughed over all the slapstick silliness but also became completely quite during the musical performances. The music was amazing.
In a world full of hate, misery, and troubled times, a movie like Sing can lift your spirits and remind you to make the time to be, well, just silly for a little while.""The movie preview emphasized the kaleidoscope properties and left a dizzy impression of visual confusion, but the complete visual effects in the movie is easy to follow. Basically MC Escher and his hyperbolic geometry in play. Beautifully done, but too short.
The casting choices are surprisingly close to perfect. Tilda Swinton delivers exquisite performance. Some like to say whitewashed, but the reality is there are white Asians. The important thing is she did a great job. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain is a good choice, but the makeup and fashion downplayed the character. As for Cumberbatch, the guy has the perfect image of Dr Strange, except I really missed his British accent, even though his American accent is very convincing.
This looks like first of a sequel. Hopefully the next one is as good.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** xXx:Return of Xander Cage is a movie sequels to the high grossing action movie xXx in 2002 staring Vin Diesel as the main action hero named Xander Cage an ex extreme sports professional turned reluctant spy for the NSA.Despire hearing so much hate the critic give this movie i still go and see it and leaving with a smile on my face.The plot of this movie is really ridiculous,the acting is terrible and the dialogue is beyond chessy but that is one of the charm of the movie.The movie is full of character acting like their are superhero when doing crazy and over the top action scene,for the most part it very fun but after that it tending to get boring really fast.Luckily in the final arc is pick up very well with many fun action scene involving slow mo gun shootout and zero gravity fight scene on a plane with Vin Diesel and Donnie Yen.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is not a perfect film, but it's a great one that deserves all the acclaim it gets.
This is a film that most people can enjoy, not saying that it was written with mass market appeal, but it's a smart, well-done film that doesn't pander to one demographic or is a clear money grab. If you make a good film, most people will like it, even if you don't specifically aim for them to like it.
This film doesn't add gratuitous sex or gore to appear edgy. There's no chase scene. The action is there because it advances the story.
Don't be deceived by its modest (but honest) rating (7.4) - the majority gave it an 8. Compare that to Batman v Superman (6.7), a film for one type of moviegoer, which ""earns"" its 6.7 rating through an impassioned young fanbase giving the film 10.
The Accountant has fewer than 3000 votes in the 4, 3, 2 and 1 star buckets. Compare that with Batman v Superman's 56000. You read that right. 56 thousand giving it less than 5 stars.
This film is basically the anti-action hero film. He is, in a way, a superhero that doesn't make a name for himself. He doesn't carve Z's into his victims, doesn't have his logo blazing in the city sky, very few people know of his existence. He doesn't wear a mask or a spandex suit. He doesn't live in a cool cave. Doesn't have a butler or a fancy car. He drives a pickup truck.
He is rich, but doesn't use the money. He is not this super good, super moral person. He works with criminals, cleaning dirty money, but he doesn't keep it for himself.
It's not black and white with a good action hero in a spandex suit fighting someone called Dr. Evil who wants to poison the city's water supply for no good reason.
At the end, he doesn't get the girl. He doesn't get the fame, the credit, or anything. He lives on the run. He gets nothing. He lives a sad and lonely life. He lives to serve.
He is a real superhero and that fact makes this a great film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** 'RAW' made me remember why I love movies. I can't wait for you all to feast your eyes and stomachs on first time French director Julia Ducournau's masterpiece in cinema, simply titled 'RAW'. Julia takes an overly done genre trope (cannibalism) and completely makes it fresh, organic, and ready to serve to the masses in a very beautiful, elegant, and most disturbing way in which a young woman is on a coming- of-age quest in her life and discovers her sexual side as well as a new appetite.
This film hits on some real primal emotions that I did not think I had in me and had me completely hypnotized from start to finish in this well-paced magnificent movie. The film follows the smart and shy young woman Justine (Garance Marillier) as she enters her very first day of university where everyone is learning to become veterinarian. At her first party, she runs into her older sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf), who is also studying to be a veterinarian and who wants to both look after her younger sister and torment her.
The older students certainly haze the incoming freshman, by making them do some grueling tasks, including throwing animal blood over all of them and making them eat raw animal organs. It's a difficult job for Justine to eat the animal organs, since she and her whole family have been vegan for all their lives, but in order to fit in, she is more or less forced to take that first taste of raw meat. Turns out, she loves it. Perhaps too much as she craves more and more of that raw meat.
At the same time, Justine is undergoing her sexual awakening, whether it be with her gay male roommate or someone else in the school. The parallels of both her food and sexual appetite are done in the most subtle and gracious ways, and at no time do you ever dislike Justine or her sister Alexia. On the contrary, these characters are so well ""fleshed"" out that you want to be friends with them. As the film plays out, Ducournau (who also wrote the screenplay) keeps delivering surprises at every corner, keeping our minds racing, stomachs rumbling, and story flowing.
The relationship between Alexia and Justine is simply fantastic. These two sisters are so real and one of the themes of the film is loyalty and family, which in no matter what obstacle comes your way, you stick together. Mariellier and Rumpf turn in exquisite performances and this being Ducournau's first film  I can't imagine how amazing her second foray into filmmaking will be. The practical effects of gore here are so realistic, that you might second guess yourself as to whether or not anyone was really harmed during the film. That's how good it is. 'RAW' is one of those films that comes around once every ten years and you shouldn't miss it.
MUST-SEE!"It was a great joy watching this movie as I always took it to be a love story between Harley Quinn and the Joker. Margot Robbie played Harley Quinn and I love her innocence. She portrayed Harley as a friendly but edgy woman that was trying to get through life. Harley seemed like she wanted to learn about love and being social. Like she wants to learn how to live in this world. Loved all of Harley Quinn's innocent moments. The Joker was plain crazy as usual and that's what I expected and loved about him. The interactions between him and Harley were heart felt. I don't know if I can mention a line from the movie here but it was something that I always want to remember. It made me think about the very few relationships I had or tried to have lol. Hearts and emotions should be taken seriously because everyone isn't a threat or trying to damage you. There are some innocent people in this world and I know because I am one of them :)."Went to watch the film as it was the only English film (other than Passengers which had terrible reviews) in theater. Didn't expect much as I read before going that it was a world war 2 romantic drama.
But I was very surprised at the action, the espionage scenes. Moreover it was great fun to watch how they had recreated the early 20th century world war 2 environment, the costumes, the music and the get ups (especially Brad Pitt Man!!). The cinematography of the film was really good.
I didn't seem to find any loop holes in the story and felt that the film was well directed and had a good story.
It is a really good film for a one time watch. Some of the espionage scenes did give me chills.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When Awards Season comes around I always set myself a target to watch as many of the nominated and winning films as possible in the three big ceremonies, if not all of them, this film was no exception. Based on the true story, in 1986, five-year-old Indian boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives in poverty in a secluded part of rural Central India with his mother Kamla Munshi (Priyanka Bose) and older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). One day Saroo follows Guddu to work, they stop at a train station, Saroo stays and awaits for his brother's return, he wakes from a sleep to find his brother has not come back, Saroo calls for Guddu, before boarding an empty train, he rests and falls asleep. Saroo wakes on the train while it is moving, alone and locked in the carriage he is forced to wait, after several days the train stops in faraway Calcutta, 1500 miles away from his home, he only speaks Hindi, so does not understand the Bangali language. Saroo is forced to spend the night in the station with other stranded children, he continues to wander around the city, before friendly woman Noor (Tannishtha Chatterjee) brings him to her apartment, she tells him that Rama (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) can help him get home, but not trusting them Saroo runs away. Saroo is found by a man who takes him to the police, he says he is from a place called ""Ganestalay"", unable to trace his family they put him in an orphanage, three months later Mrs. Sood (Saroj Sood) tells him his photograph has been in the newspaper, but no-one has claimed him. An Australian couple want to adopt him, so Saloo is taught some English and taken to Australia to be cared for by Sue Brierley (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Nicole Kidman) and her husband John (The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham), later they also adopt Mantosh (Keshav Jadhav), who has trouble adjusting. Twenty years later, Saroo (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Dev Patel) has moved to Melbourne to study hotel management and started a relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). One night, sharing an Indian meal with friends, Saroo starts to recall his childhood, he tells that he is adopted but has little memory of his hometown location, his friends suggest using Google Earth to search. Saroo begins to search, using the past memories he can recall, but he disconnects with Lucy, and is overwhelmed thinking of the emotions his family must have gone through when he went missing. Saroo visits Sue, whose health is deteriorating, she tells that she was never infertile, she and John decided to help others and thought there were too many people already in the world. Saroo continues his search on Google Earth with no success, then one night he extends his search further, from Calcutta he follows the track, eventually finding the station where he boarded the train, then he notices the rock formations where his mother worked, he finally finds where he lived, the town is called Khandwa, but the neighbourhood is Ganesh Talai (""Ganestalay""). Saroo finally tells adoptive mother Sue about his search, she is fully supportive of his efforts, he takes a flight to India to find and return to his former hometown, in the end he has a highly emotional reunion with his biological mother and sister, but is sad to learn that Guddu is dead. The real Saroo Brierley returned home in 2012, his brother Guddu was killed by a train the same night he disappeared, his mother never gave up hope that her missing son would return, his adoptive mother also came to meet his biological mother in India, and it is revealed that Saroo learned he had been mispronouncing his own name, which was actually Sheru, which in Hindi means ""Lion"". It is odd that Patel is nominated Supporting Actor when he is the lead star, perhaps because the child and he is not highly well-known in Hollywood, he does give a good performance, as does Kidman as his caring and nurturing adoptive mother, but it is young newcomer Pawar who shines as the poor child who is unintentionally separated from his family, he should have been nominated! The first half of the film is amazing, the boy from a remote village with no money and identification getting lost and trying to find way back, the second half does plod on a little with the grown up Indian nervous to return home, but it does show the good the internet can do, and the final reunion is tearjerking, all in all it is moving and thought-provoking stuff, I would highly recommend it, a brilliant drama. It is nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score for Dustin O'Halloran and Volker Bertelmann, it is nominated the BAFTA, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Very good!""Star Wars the Force Awakens is a great new installments to the Star Wars universe as it adds a great jumping on point for new people to the franchise. However it provides a great continuation of what die hards love about Star Wars as people who love all previous installments in the franchise will feel right at home.
Force Awakens brings a great cast with some familiar faces into the film which provides it with a strong foundation for success in the future as it has successfully reinvigorated the franchise.
Even though this film has taken cues from a New Hope in terms of story and characters it hardly works to its detriment in the grand scheme of things.
All in all a great film and a must see for all Star Wars fans and those looking to get into the wide world of Star Wars.""Susan receives a manuscript, written by her ex-husband, in which he tells a violent story. She gets very involved into the story, because she sees it as a revenge tale.
Tom Ford, the designer, returns to direct another film after a hiatus of seven years. Ford shows in this film that he hasn't lost his mojo. His artistic vison really helped to create very good looking and stylish shots, with a lot of use of color, which brings its own meaning to the shot. Ford used cold colors (blue, white) in the scenes with Amy Adams (Susan) and warmer colors (red, orange) in the scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal (Tony). I haven't come to realize why he chose to use different colors for the both of them, but I have a few guesses. One of them is that he decided to do this, to show the difference between what was taking place in the book and what was taking place in ""real life"". Another guess I have is that the colder colors represent the loneliness and sadness Susan is feeling. But those are just guesses. Ford didn't only use these colors to symbolize cold and warm, but also to show emotions. Red stood for love, or death. Green stood for envy. The use of color was sublime and really made you think more about the movie. The shot composition too was very good and the camera movements as well. The use of shadow was perfect. In short: this was a gorgeous looking movie. Another thing that Tom Ford did was creating a weird film. He didn't make a straightforward film, but he created a film that has you thinking about it after you've seen it. It even starts way in the beginning with the opening credits, that were kind of weird, but fantastically set up the theme for the rest of the movie. It prepares you for what's to come and immediately shows that the movie is not your average film, but something that's different than all, which I very much enjoyed. The soundtrack I found to be fitting and original. It helped a lot to set up the scene. The editing also helped with this, but also to show the similarities between the manuscript and Susan's life. This was done in a very good manner and the pacing was good too. I didn't feel that the movie was too long or too short: it was just the right length. Due to this the film also never drags, which is of course a good thing.
The acting was absolutely marvelous. Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams both give excellent performances. Gyllenhaal played his character so well, that I didn't see Jake Gyllenhaal, but Tony, or at times Edward. He performed well in the emotional scenes, but he is also very good in showing the subtle character progression he goes through. Amy Adams has previously starred in this years ""Arrival"", where she plays a totally different character. It's really fascinating to see how diverse she can act, because the two characters have no correlation to each other. Like I've said: two different characters. In both cases she gave a fantastic performance, and that's why I was surprised she didn't get an Oscar nod for one of her performances. Not only Gyllenhaal and Adams gave a wonderful performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon were superb as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson was really unrecognizable. He was scary, weird and really nailed the part. Michael Shannon too was fantastic. He gave, in my opinion, the best performance of the entire film.
The screenplay was also a very good adaptation. The dialogue was good, but the narrative was the thing that really spoke to me. I very much enjoyed the way how they wove together the three stories and kept it all easy to differentiate. All of the stories were very intriguing, whereby I wasn't bored a single minute. The characters were original and not clichéd. You were able to care for them and they also went through some development. I very much liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character. He played the main villain of the story, but the way they wrote him was brilliant. He was scary and intimidating, yet he wasn't really big, or built in a strong manner. It all came from his character. Amy Adams character was also multi-layered. At first she just seems like any other wealthy person, but as the movie progresses, you get to know her more, mostly because of the flashback scenes. The ending was also very good. It doesn't explain itself, which I like very much. This ensures that there are multiple explanations for it.
""Nocturnal Animals"" has quickly grown to be one of the best movies of 2016, in my opinion at least. The film challenges you to think about it, not only during the film, but also after the credits have stopped rolling. Tom Ford created a visually stunning film, with some weird scene, but those all have an underlying meaning to them. Because of those reasons summed up just now, I'm giving ""Nocturnal Animals"" a 9.5/10.""My headline really says it all. The effects are so hyper-real that one can almost forget that they are man-made, and the talents of the stars doing the various animals' voices are great!
My concern is the levels of anxiety-producing violence (and threats of violence) in the film. I suppose that after the first viewing, a kid would know how each scene ends, so maybe they wouldn't be that scared any more. But a first viewing would be way too intense for any kid under about 10. Which makes the PG rating appropriate. But, as we know, too many parents don't pay attention to the ratings, and they take even little kids to films like this and/or buy the DVD, which I think isn't good for them.
I'm also sad that the tiger is the bad guy in this film. As we know, the number of tigers in the wild is only in the hundreds at this point, so they are very close to extinction. Yes, yes -- I know that's how Kipling wrote the stories, but it still makes me sad that kids may start judging tigers to be evil because of this movie.""I'm a huge fan of W. Bruce Cameron's books, especially A Dog's Purpose and A Dog's Journey. So I came to this movie with high expectations. And it did not disappoint! The author and his wife co-wrote the screenplay, so the heart and soul of the books were in the film. I saw this movie twice, once at an advance screening at Showcase Springdale in Cincinnati with my husband and adult children, and again on opening day at the Rave Dayton South with my dad, step-mom and grandmother. Half of us had read the book beforehand, the other half hadn't. It didn't matter. We all absolutely LOVED this touching, heart-warming, funny film. You will laugh, you will cry, you will laugh some more, and then you'll leave the theatre ready to adopt a(nother) dog. I sure hope they make A Dog's Journey into a movie also.""Actually welcome to the City (Zoo). Suspend your disbelief you say? Well obviously that is something you should do! It's a cartoon for one and there is an animal society, not unlike many humans have build around the globe. And there are many allegories that may be able to make you think about stuff you do or preoccupied ideas or notions you have about other people.
All in all, this does deal with clichés in a funny way, but also has a story that is intriguing. The idea that some can become wild and therefor be a menace to society is not new. But setting it not only in an animated feature but one that is also aimed at kids could be considered risky. But Disney pulls it off. So good in fact that I would not be surprised if the Oscar goes to ... but we'll see about that. Watch it and make up your own mind of course""Upon seeing the trailers, we were left a little unsure of many details within this movie. We were hoping for something greater than just an Affleck led action/suspense movie, and we were not disappointed at all.
Of course there is a good deal of action and violence, but where this movie really shines is within the background stories of the most involved characters.
To make characters endearing the movie must make you feel a believable emotion to create the desired affinity. Without going into any spoilers, I can say that this movie made a very consistent effort to tie all roles and values together, in a logical fashion. The reasons behind all actions within the movie were complemented heavily by little sub plots running at the same time. Everything was tied together very well, and the characters were found to be very likable by the end.
The movie definitely touches on some sensitive real life issues, and provides an open minded view which can be thought provoking for some.
All in all, this movie exceeded my expectations in many ways.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Overall: This movie serves its main purpose - It's funny. Everyone who I watched this with was crying from laughter in this movie. I would watch it; it is entertaining enough.
Good: All the characters are fun and interesting and the premise is quite cool. It is hysterically funny with lots of jokes due to the drastically contrasting character.Pretty much everyone does a good job acting wise with the two standouts being obviously Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg. The two kids also do fantastic jobs considering their young age which is to be applauded. The story is okay but the ending more than makes up for it with a heart-warming, full circle end. The cinematography was reasonable and can't be faulted much.
Bad: ​The actual story itself was pretty mediocre and was just a scramble of scripted events of them trying to beat each other without any rhythm or structure to them until the end. Linda Carledini's acting was sub-par and just felt lazy and like she wanted a pay check. The ending felt, while clever and funny, like sequel bait which, while I'd love to see, is something I hate in a movie that isn't pre- established as a series and has a satisfying ending.
Best Part: 'James and the Giant Peach'
MVP: Will Ferrell as Brad
8/10""Well edited movie was made by Turks at the end of 2016.
The demonstration of how local people of Iraq suffer from Isıs's terrorism and how actually they are eager to fight against Isıs if they have had opportunity is really informative and emotional.
The cut scenes from past of soldiers with related content of each action scenes interestingly gives understanding of a real soldier perspective on situations ,so it just demonstrates their mixed minds between real-life and soldier-life in Battlefield.
It's really well edited to show how soldiers effort to be senseless while they are fighting but they are just human and emotional beings.
The fact of usage of real guns and tanks in movie leads to creation of virtual reality in movie. You feel like you are operating with the Turkish Special Force Team.
The movie also shows their actual fight against being non-emotional order servant, and shows honorable Turkish emotions on local people of Iraq.""The original ""Sin City"" movie is currently ranked as one of the best movies of all time on this website. While I saw it and didn't find it to be great, I had no problem with it. I actually enjoyed this one. I admit that its main problem is how confusing it is with the first movie. It actually has scenes that take place both before and after the original movie, so it's kind of like a ""The Godfather Part II"" thing. While that film obviously did it better, I really did like this. It helps that there are so many wonderful actors in this. I'm kind of a sucker for stuff with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Lloyd. Wait, they were in ""Angels In The Outfield""! What a strange movie reunion.
The film just looks beautiful. While I still like the first one better, it's great to see all this cool action and interesting scenarios play out. It's not as much an anthology series as the original film as the characters do interact with each other. It is less confusing that way. Still, the original was better done. I still love the outgoing color effects in this film. Everything just sticks out so perfectly and the atmosphere is great. While a lot of people didn't like it, I myself would recommend it. ***""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This films tells the story of the hunt for the infamous, who himself 'Zodiac', who has committed a series of murders in Northern California in the late sixties and early seventies. The crimes probably wouldn't have been linked if the killer hadn't contacted the police in each case then written to various newspapers listing his killings, which took place in different jurisdictions. His letter includes a code which he demands to be published. Both the police and the media work to identify the killer and as more letters arrive claiming responsibility for more murders and attempted murders as well as issuing a threat to target school children. As time passes various suspects emerge and are eliminated, largely due to handwriting evidence and there being no match for the fingerprint left at one of the crime scenes. Eventually the trail turns cold, the letters and killings stop and people gradually forget about the case except for Robert Graysmith of the San Francisco Chronicle; not as a reporter but as a cartoonist. Over the years he talks to witnesses and pours through police files until he finds a suspect he is convinced committed the killings.
Director David Fincher did a fine job bringing this real life mystery to the screen It may have helped that all I knew about the case was that it inspired the film 'Dirty Harry' but I was gripped from the start. Thankfully the film doesn't dwell too much on the killings or even the killer; instead in concentrates on those investigating the case; how they go about trying to identify the killer and the effect their work has on their own lives. Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job as protagonist Robert Graysmith making us believe in his obsession with the case. He is ably supported by Robert Downey Jr. who plays a colleague; Mark Ruffalo who plays the San Francisco detective leading the case and Chloë Sevigny who plays Graysmith's wife. Given that the original case is still officially unsolved there is no cast iron identification of the killer but those wanting resolution will be happy that by the end we are given a prime suspect and it is made clear that most of those involved are convinced of his guilt. There are a few shocking scenes early on and some tense moments later on but there is little that could be considered gratuitous and the film in no way glamourises the crimes or the chief suspect as some films in the genre do. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to people who enjoy a good mystery but don't demand that every loose end is wrapped up.""Unbroken is a movie directed by Angelina Jolie. It's based on the novel Unbroken, written by Laura Hillenbrand. This novel is about the trials, and adversity in the life of Louis Zamperini, a POW during World War II. The movie as well focuses on Louis Zamperini's journey, what he went through, and his story. The movie begins with Louis in a plane with a few other men. While in the plane there are periodic flashbacks giving the viewer insight into Louis life before the war. These scenes are helpful, giving the viewer a taste of the overall picture. However they can be quite confusing, switching back and forth from past to present. Once the plane has landed the movie goes onto explain Louis' childhood, his relationship with his family, and his childhood struggles. After learning about Louis life and family the movie goes into the overall story of his experience during World War II. As a whole, the movie reflected the book quite well. The characters and structure were pretty much identical. One of the differences between the two, is that the book begins with Louis' childhood and works its way up to the war, while the movie jumps between past and present, before getting into the larger part of the story. Another difference in the book is that when the story is coming to an end, there is much more talk of his family, and what happens in his life after the war. The movie did not cover this as well. The movie ends with a few pictures of Louis family and friends but nothing is really mentioned in detail about his life after the story. This movie is a very inspirational, true story of survival under the worst conditions imaginable. Louis' story really makes the viewers, and readers realize that life for us is not all that hard. This movie is very well executed and is very engaging to anyone who views it.""Louise Banks (Amy Adams) loses her daughter due to illness. She's a linguistics professor when alien ships land on earth. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks her for translation help and she convinces him to join his contact group. The group includes physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are one of twelve teams around the world in contact with their own spaceship. The aliens use a circular smoke-like writing system. The Chinese team translates one of the symbols as ""use weapon"". This sets off mistrust from several of the global teams.
This is a change from the action-oriented sci-fi movies. It asks questions and challenges the audience. It's a mystery sci-fi. It is smart although I wonder if it could be even smarter. I want the writing system to be more compelling and more connected in some way. There is a big reveal and I want it all to interconnect in a more compelling way. I can't give away too much. Amy Adams does some good work. It's a beautiful film both visually and thematically.""I went into the movie without having any idea of the plot, or even who made it. All i really knew about it was it was suppose to be very sad, and it really lived up to that. Im not gonna spoil anything for those who haven't watched it yet, but let me just say that this is definitely one of the best movies of the last five years. I didn't really knew any of the actors but i was very pleasantly surprised with them. The story is rock solid and it also got some very beautiful shots and just very good directing. The story is great but hard, and you never quite know what to think until the movies last shot. I wanna finish by saying i highly recommend this movie and i really hope you will like it is much as me.""When thinking of my least favourite genres Horror and Musicals come to mind, so as you can imagine I wasn't exactly ecstatic to see this film but I ended up very impressed with one of the better musicals I've seen in my life. I think for the most part this film was very impressive, it's not without its flaws but found this film to be very much worth the watch. When Tom Hooper won the Oscar for The Kings Speech the only thing that really bothered me about that was the fact that it didn't really put his talents on full display but their front and centre here, all the musical numbers and character direction is perfect, it really did make you believe the dire situation that these characters lived in and it truly proved to me his talent as a director. Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant in this film, not only is his singing voice fantastic but he carried a real burden and shame with him that Jackman perfectly portrayed. Few performances limited performances have impressed as much as Anne Hathaway in this film, her absolute emotional destruction was perfectly conveyed through her performance and created for some truly emotionally tragic scenes. When I hear bad things about Russell Crowes performance all I can do is scratch my head, I thought he was amazing in this film, he was a true antagonist who was not all the different from Valjean and I though Crowe brought true complexity to the character. This film also looks stunning, all the French streets, dirty alleys and poverty ridden areas truly gave out an impression that truly hooked me. But I don't think this film base some issues for one, after the first 20 minutes the film failed to really grip or interest me, it slowed the film down completely and seemed to spend to much time devoted to setting up the final act rather than give a compelling narrative of its own. The run time is also a bit excessive and the pacing drags quite a lot for me. Also seeing as it is a film called, The Miserable it's got a lot of really sad scenes that while obviously need to be there just don't make me want to go back and watch it again.
Everything from a technical and performance standpoint in this film is incredible, it's one of the best looking films in recent memory, while there's not a whole lot to drag me back to watch this again it's definitely a film worth watching that truly leaves an impression.
81%/A-""Wall-e is an extraordinary movie. It is not as much fun as Toy Story, but it is extremely well done and far deeper; the story is classic but the mode is quite unique. If you did not like the movie, I truly feel sorry for you. If your boy friend does not like the movie, dump him. It is a movie that you should see. It will make you feel good and think about the world we live in. I liked it much better than 2001; that film borrowed from many other films and so to criticize Wall-e for that is perhaps naive. It also borrows from Star Wars but it is more innocent and moving and the plot line is more boy meets girl; becomes hero. You really care about Wall-e. The movie does not have a lot of dialog and so it relies on visual humor and very well done animations by Pixar.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After the great Wall Street crash in 1929, Charlie Chaplin set about to making a film about how much modern technology had effected the employment and the need of men and women in the times of the industrial revolution. And he did a hell of a job. Modern Times revolves around a young factory worker under pressure, who comes into contact with various forms of technology at the factory where he works. What comes after that is a gaggle of different hilarious scenes of slap stick, for example there's the scene with the conveyor belt where we see the factory worker struggling to keep up with the pallets that come to him, what ensues is pure comedy gold from Chaplin. Now compared to some of his other films, Chaplin mainly operates alone in Modern Times and to be honest It's all the more better in some ways. It's nice to see Chaplin just having a chance to go into full on comic mode for the film's duration. What's still amazing about Modern Times is that even though revolutions have come and gone, the film is still relevant to this day. Thousands of hard working citizens are out of work due to technology, and in some ways It is better but there is still a significant toll on employment. It's not rare for a moral of a Chaplin movie to stay relevant but the one in Modern Times is probably one of the more common undertones. And for that reason and many others, Modern Times is definitely one of Chaplin's greatest movies, and It's still great today.""Sleeper belongs to the initial phase of Woody Allen's filmography when his films were more skewed towards slapstick and farcical humour instead of narrative cohesion. But I didn't need narrative coherence as much, to be honest when the lines being spoken are so funny. One liners galore and Allen's sharp and sarcastic humour is really the star attraction of the film. Also Allen was clearly paying a tribute to the slapstick-comedy films of the silent era. The slapstick montages in the film accompanied by uptempo jazz music are very reminiscent to similar scenes of films starring Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton,etc. Along with being immensely witty, this film shows that Woody Allen also used to be an exponent of physical comedy.
But underneath the craziness on the surface, there is social commentary taking place through satire. Through the narrative structure of a man from 1973 being sent to the future, Allen was satirizing and poking fun at the contemporary American society of 1970s. There is a bit of similarity between 'Sleeper' and Yorgos Lanthimos' 'The Lobster'. Both these films critique the totalitarian establishment and the pretentious bourgeois culture in the first half, but the second half to some extent undercuts the message of the first half by critiquing the organised rebellion. This is why I think just like 'The Lobster', 'Sleeper' is a film that upholds the concept of individualism and the need to retain your own, unique identity in an ideologically segmented society when you don't completely identify with either side of the ideological divide.
Visually the film looks very much like the sci-fi films of the era. The sets and props look very similar to the ones that you find in something like 'The Andromeda Strain' or 'THX 1138'. The camera doesn't do anything remarkable, but the film moves forward at a breakneck speed. The chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton is brilliant. Their banter makes the film so much more colourful.
The film lacks narrative balance at times as we rush from one scene to the next. But 'Sleeper' is a genuinely witty and sharply humorous film that anyone can find rewarding.""""A boy seeks the help of a tree monster to cope with his single mother's terminal illness.""
Based upon the novel written by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls is directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible). He knows how to tell a compelling story in his movies and A Monster Calls is no exception. I did not read the book, but it makes me want to read it after seeing this wonderful movie. Patrick Ness did the screenplay too, so I would assume the movie is very similar to his own book.
The actors were great, including Lewis MacDougall (Conor), who plays the ""too old to be a child, and to young to be a man"". He carries this movie almost by himself, as we follow his inner conflicts. I was totally invested in his character throughout the film. Liam Neeson (The Monster), Toby Kebbell, Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver were all great following the lead of MacDougall.
I was surprised by all the visual effects put in this movie, all the dye artwork and The Monster itself. The style, elegance were just stunning.
I Hope this movie gets more recognition, since it bombed at the box office. You should really take a look at this movie if you are interested. Kids and parents will like it, but I feel like the parents will enjoy it more, since it has a deeper meaning, tells the truth and nothing but the truth and brings you back to your childhood.
Entertaining, sad and an unforgettable tale that will sticks with you for a long time, worth watching.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Alright so before I start this review at all, I do have one solitary problem with Clint Eastwood's American Sniper. It's a very, very minor problem but It's still there and It manages to take the film down a notch. That bloody baby ... of course what I mean is the scene in which Bradley Cooper's character Chris Kyle picks up his, excuse me: child and said child happens to be a bad excuse for a plastic doll. Blimey that was a mistake. However ... other than that, American Sniper is a greatly directed motion picture starring Bradley Cooper in one of his best roles since Silver Linings Playbook. I think we can all agree that It isn't very often that movies capture the environment of war in recent memory very well, but American Sniper manages to do that exact thing. Now sadly as well, the film is based on a true story ... and Chris Kyle was murdered after his service. And for that reason as well It was of vital importance that Clint Eastwood did a good job with the film and as I say he did an exemplary job of that exact thing. As well as the expert direction from Eastwood, Bradley Cooper truly gives a ground-breaking performance. There's one particular scene where he's perched on a rooftop building and there's this brilliant amount of suspense as a young boy picks up a weapon and Kyle has to kill the young boy until he drops said weapon. Truly very intense. Combined with Eastwood's brilliant direction and Cooper's acting, American Sniper is a phenomenal movie. Just try and ignore that scene ...""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It has been said that My Neighbor Totoro is actually based on a famous murder case called ""The Sayama Incident."" This case occurred on May 1, 1963 in Sayama City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, when a man kidnapped, raped, and killed a 16-year-old high school girl.
This conspiracy theory has been around for a long time, actually. It got really heated on the internet, and then finally Ghibli had to make an official statement. In 2007, they did just that, denying that the urban legend was true.
Read about the similarities with the incident and then re-watch the movie, you'll see it in a very different perspective.""Milos Formans, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Next is a film that relys on its characters in the best possible way, it doesn't take them too seriously but Strikes the perfect balance in them between light hearted and at some times dark, I do not consider this film to be a masterpiece but I still think it is one of the most unique I've ever seen. I really mean that, there was not one second of this movie where I was not entertained like I said mainly due to the characters and there interactions, they use the patients mental difficulties to its advantage to make for a lot of hilarious dark comedy. I could not have imagined a better choice to play the lead in this film than Jack Nicholson, there is not for scene where he is unconvincing as this character, he knows just when to go a little over the top but never does it to ridiculous levels. Louise Fletcher was so fantastic in this film she was so utterly despicable in this film, the way she played with the patients and manipulated them for almost her own entertainment is so frustrating to watch, I do have a few issues with the character but Fletchers performance was all but flawless. But in my opinion this films most underrated and best performance is from Bard Dourif he was absolutely amazing in this film, his stutter and lack of confidence made him such a sympathetic character, he has so many great scenes with Nicholson and ended up being this films most tragic character. I also love that the other mental patients aren't just there for comedic relief their very well developed characters who all have reasons for their predicaments. I also loved the battle between MacMurphy and Nurse Ratched was not only hilarious but above all just satisfying to see the Nurse gradually lose control of the people's she's used as pawns for so long. But I do have a few issues with this film and my biggest is that Nurse Ratched while great as a hate able antagonist, she doesn't really get much development, she's really just there to be an evil presence to be tortured by Nicholson. Another thing that I really didn't like about this film was that it was ultimately style over substance I'm not saying that it didn't work for this film I just think it would have made the film just a bit more satisfying to watch if there was some kind of message behind it.
I think that this is a fantastic film it's constant entertainment, Nicholson, Fletcher and Dourif where all amazing in this film, it never takes itself to seriously and all the characters where used in perfect ways.
83%/A-""¿Are you romantic? If yes you are at the right spot reading this, If not then maybe this isn't the movie for you..
I am indeed very much so, and therefore..
This is simply my favourite movie.
By the way there were two versions of the film originally a longer much worse one and a slightly shorter version which is the final one and the one which is now widely available and the one finally kept by the director.
The longer version was a bit of a pity I'm afraid, It made the movie loose all its magic and the director Mr Tornatore, was incredibly keen, smart to cut those non-sense scenes and keep only the ones that where useful to preserve all the magic of the movie intact. and here we are talking about a great amount of magic indeed!
This film is quite biographical and talks about important things in life (I lived most of them too)
Things that happen in real life , the first love, true friendship between two differently aged persons, and great life learnings and true life situations such as an first special magical love you once unsuccessfully tried to pursue in your life but like in Dante's literature (inferno) that so many times slips away , and when you try to recover it it may well be too late, it talks about career decisions and life ambition and it is also one the most beautiful most romantic movie I 've ever seen.
Is also an"" Homage "" to the history of movie making and of the world of cinema in general throughout the years, many people won't remember it but the firm was made and produced in the the difficult late 1980's( 1988-89) when cinema was actually truly dying , cinemas were empty ( I actually first saw the movie in Italian in almost empty cinema in 1990) , when the movie came about the true and sad reality was that people didn't't go to the movies anymore and rather just hired a movie tape at home or not even that..
So this masterpiece was like a Hymn like the french revolution's ""la marseilles hymn"" coming to the rescue of all the things that cinema represents to us as humans, the movie therefore appeared just in the right moment and for me it came to engrave in our hearts our love for cinema and tried at that to rescue all the movie movie making and of the magic world of cinema making, that was becoming extinct..
To me it came like a first love, a surprise and reminded us all what going to the cinema is all about the experience, the magic feeling you get , the sensations and feelings you share with a crowd of unknown people laughing all together.
The film is a poetical representation of love , is about sharing feelings, sharing those special limited, instants of limited time in your life on this planet, and feel with other humans the warmth in your heart , the magic that cannot ever be replaced of the first time your heart actually gets loose and suddenly accelerates and your feelings explode and intensify and you feel love for the first time in your life..
This film is about love the love of people, the love of humankind, it is a film about the first love, the one you will never forget and about the great love and passion some people like me feel about cinema in general.
Undoubtedly a Magnificent masterpiece and a fantastic timeless LOVE-film made for our souls by Giusseppe Tornatore, wonderful music and Love Theme written by Ennio Morricone and violin played by Itzhak Perlman my most admired violinist creates like in Queen's famous song A KIND OF MAGIC .. few other films have ever matched..
This film is a a must see a classic unrepeatable, once in a lifetime cinematographic jewel masterpiece, the kind I love to watch with my wife in a romantic winter evening by the chimney place.. Enjoy!

I have to be in a proper mood and have to be willing to get on a journey or an adventure, if you will, to another place and time. Happily, the conditions were right for me to watch an epic and I did watch Lawrence. A lot of things were intriguing about that film: The amazing cinematography, the framing of shots, the impeccable crowd control, and, you know, all the technical stuff. Although not as good as Lawrence's, these qualities are present in other epics as well. What really drew me into the film was T.E Lawrence's character in the film. Usually in epics, the characters take a back seat for the sake of the action or events. But here we see this intimate personal story of a man who, for some reason, challenges and tests himself: Burning his hand with the matchstick, standing in front of a man firing bullets towards him and almost killing him, and constantly going to dangerous battles with the Arabs. For what? He's not doing it for his country and most probably not for the Arabs. He is trying to prove something to himself about himself. He is a deeply self-destructive character and to have such small exquisite story of a man within the epic canvas of the wars and the desert is just extraordinary. I can't believe that Sam Spiegel really took a chance on this madly genius (and very risky) film. I give credit to him, to Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson for the amazing screenplay, to the terrific Peter O Toole and Omar Sharif and , of course, to the man himself, one of cinema's greatest filmmaking artists, Mr. David Lean.""A story about a group of aid workers trying to solve a problem and all they need is a rope. How hard could it possibly be to find a rope ? Add in the fact that they are in the middle of a war torn country. Strewn about are the remnants of war and a fragile peace that hangs by a thread. The dangers and hardships are real as this mixed group of people navigates the foreign countryside, language and its people.
Beautifully crafted the story takes us along their journey. Encounter after encounter, problem after problem they press on with their singular mission. In the end the problem is solved in the simplest of ways. A story about humanity and more importantly what many of us take for granted in our daily lives. Bravo to the producers, cast and crew of this wonderful movie.""Seriously I can't get this movie out of my mind. And I don't understand why foolish, jealous criticizers writing dull reviews for this movie, whereas this movie deserves to be honored to get more than 8 rating. It's become one of my most beloved movies. It's impeccable. It's scary too, but the main theme of this movie isn't horror. This movie is full definition of thriller and if you're a real movie fanatic and don't want to watch a cliché, then this movie is perfect for you. Because it's absolutely impeccable story which is far different from other horror and thrillers. So what are you waiting for? Go on, buy it and enjoy the one of the world's greatest movies.

Dave is a typical American teenager, that once got a Superhero suit as a present and he tried to fight against crime, and he got famous overnight. Soon he realized it's not easy being a superhero and that's when he meets Hit-Girl and Big Daddy. Hit-Girl is a little bad-ass that fights against and Big Daddy is her father that gets her in the world of crime. If you watch this movie for pure enjoyment, comedy and action you are going to love it. It's some of the most enjoyable movie experiences I had in years. Hit-Girl is the absolute boss in this movie. She reminds me of Mathilda in Leon: The professional a lot. And I also loved its originality. Matthew Vaughn charmed me with this movie, I can't see anybody hating this movie. And if you do, congrats you are a special cookie. Even tho how enjoyable the movie is it does have some problems. I thought the villains fighting skills were neat, but I thought their motivations were shoe-horned and The Red Mist pretending to be this friend of Dave and how he doesn't want ""them"" to hurt him and by the end, he's fighting him. I think they could've had Big Daddy alive, I thought his death was more like ""we need some of the protagonists dead"" death.""It is very often we see a brilliantly written and executed Science-fiction thriller in Indian Cinema and 24 is one among them for sure. Director Vikram K Kumar, who also wrote the screenplay is rthe star.The complex screenplay works so well and misses nothing that is needed for a Tamil movie.Movies like Kabali,Theri came with stories that are told many times, 24 is fresh.Suriya needs to appreciated for the portrayal of the three roles,especially Athreya. The movies is all about a cat and mouse between Mani and Athreya for the time machine.It also contains a love track between Suriya and Samantha, which lags and is not up to the mark. A.R Rahman's music could be credited as one of the pluses for the song Naan Un .S. Thiru is another highlight of the flick.He has done a marvellous job in almost all the scenes.The VFX in the film is one of India's best works.The BGM gives the mood.The narrative is kept simple throughout and is entertaining.24 is a cleverly crafted science fiction thriller which has it's strengths like the energetic performance from Suriya, a brilliant screenplay,excellent VFX etc.The love track is the only thing which makes us bored.Overall it could be credited as one of the best Indian movies of 2016.If you are looking for something different,this is for you.It will never disappoint you😃""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""Paths of Glory"" is the film that officially transformed Kubrick from a talented young director to a genius in the eyes of the public. Although I consider ""The Killing"" an already stellar film, I see why this one would get so much love: its anti-war themes are splendidly developed in Kubrick's unforgiving way, giving the viewer every reason to keep his hopes high, but regularly smashing them in his face, showing how the world actually works and not how the classic movies would like to make us believe. The character of Dax (a performance that Kirk Douglas grows into as the movie progresses) seems to be the only reasonable person in a maddened system where human lives matter less than the career of the powerful. The natural instinct of survival (showed by the sentenced soldiers as they approach the end) is labelled as ""cowardice"" and reprimanded by those who are not in danger, of course. But the scene that may have moved me the most is the ending, with the French soldiers first taunting the German girl but then getting emotional as they realize that they share the human nature, and all the mad orders they follow have no meaning at all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There have been innumerable films about World War II, but relatively few about the Holocaust, a subject which, at least for the first few decades after the war, seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some fine attempts to come to terms with the most notorious crime of the twentieth century, including Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is another to add to this list.
The film is based on the autobiography of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish pianist, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. (As one character points out, Szpilman's surname is an appropriate one; it is a Polonised form of ""Spielmann"", the German for ""musician""). In September 1939 the Szpilman family are living in relative middle-class comfort in Warsaw when they learn that the country has been invaded by Germany. The film then traces the way in which the situation of Poland, and especially of its Jewish community, deteriorates throughout the course of the war- the passing of anti-Jewish laws, the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and finally the deportations to the concentration camps beginning in 1942. By a stroke of chance Szpilman is separated from his family when they are deported to Treblinka extermination camp. For a time he becomes a slave labourer, but manages to escape and is sheltered by non-Jewish friends linked to the Polish resistance, surviving while thousands are dying around him and while his city is gradually turned into a wasteland of rubble.
A key scene comes towards the end of the film. Much of the city, including the building in which Szpilman was sheltering, has been destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and Szpilman is desperately trying to hide in a ruined building when he is discovered by a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld guesses that Szpilman is Jewish, but takes pity on him and spares his life, even bringing him food and giving him a coat to help him survive.
Szpilman's story had a deep personal significance for Polanski, himself a Polish Jew who managed to survive the war in hiding, although other members of his family, including his mother, died. It is therefore unsurprising that it has a greater emotional resonance than many of Polanski's earlier films, which can often be rather emotionally cool. Szpilman is a gifted musician, but his survival has very little to do with his talent and a great deal to do with the kindness of others and with sheer luck. It is a role which called for a superb actor, and Polanski was fortunate enough to find one in the shape of Adrien Brody, who won a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar. (Strangely enough, Brody was not the director's first choice for the role- that was Joseph Fiennes, who was unavailable). Brody's Szpilman becomes a sort of Everyman figure, a tragic version of Chaplin's Little Tramp, stumbling his way through a city which has been reduced to a vision of Hell on Earth. As Roger Ebert put it, he is not a fighter or a hero but a survivor.
Polanski himself won the ""Best Director"" award. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to ""Chicago"". ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing record of man's inhumanity to man, but it is also a film with a message of hope in that it shows how even unspeakable barbarity like that of the Nazis cannot altogether extinguish man's better instincts, shown by the kindness and bravery of Szpilman's friends and his defiant rendition of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante at the end. It is one of the most moving films about the war that I know, comparable in this respect to either Pakula's or Spielberg's. 9/10""well well i really didn't get the story when the first time i saw this movie.. but something keep me itching to see this movie again and after quite a time i saw this movie once more. in the start it was not clear to me whats happening but as the story goes it can get all the attention of yours so as it takes mine. story, dialogues, acting all the things are there to make a classic. and the end it will blow your mind. in my opinion one of the best movies ever made. but one thing allays challenge my mind that who is the real Keyser Söze is it the verbal because he never really portray that smarted enough to be Keyser Söze. one more thing that i like the character keaton very much and even get sad at the time of his death in the movie. well as i said earlier it is a type of movie which will make to watch to it.""Shah Rukh Khan really has proved himself once again!!! You will not see a super hero playing villain role these days but SHAH RUKH KHAN did it and oh my god how well he played it!! I enjoyed watching him playing a role like he did in Baazigar or Darr. Moreover, the film would not have been the same without his co cast which is Nawazuddin Siddique, Mahira Khan and Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub. Mahira Khans acting in her debut was well played so credits to her for acting so well in her first Bollywood movie and that with a movie star like SRK. Well done to the director of the movie, Rahul Dholakia, for this masterpiece! The scenes and the dialogues are just brilliant because everything makes sense and is very logical. Overall, the movie has a great message! Once again hats off to the whole cast and I am looking forward to see more of Mahira Khan :-)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Pan's Labyrinth is a magical, twisted fantasy tale by Guillermo Del Toro. Del Toro's imagination for the film is almost one of Alice in Wonderland. There are many similarities between the two movies, but also many differences. The movie is dark and twisted but tells a great story about a young girl struggling during the Francoist period. There are many twists in the movie and the creatures that Del Toro brings to life are incredibly creepy. The ending is very open-ended in terms of what could be real and what could be fake, which is why this movie really shines. There is evidence that supports both of the endings and that makes this movie truly magical. Please do not let reading subtitles stop you from seeing this movie. You will truly be missing out on something magical.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Sharon, dear, escape from the night Red and black drawings And the far lights, Your Silent Hill is mutely rattling Void red-hot in the souls of mothers.

The film is totally bonkers and as such is a black comedy splatter masterpiece. Chainsaw 2 is a great follow up to the first film and is much different. The story continues with The Sawyer family. There is not only large doses of dark humor, but also heavy helpings of state of the art gore.(courtesy of F/X master Tom Savini) The film is completely insane and very unique blood splattered entertainment. Bill Mosley gives a legendary over the top performance as lunatic Chop Top. Dennis Hopper also gives an iconic performance as revenge seeking Texas Ranger Lefty Enright, which is also one of my favorite performances of his. The film has great quotable dialouge and is a very creepy, brutal and hilarious horror classic. Chainsaw 2 is one of my all time favorites and is essential viewing for horror fans.""These four ladies are hilarious! You have to pay close attention to their dialogue in order to reap the benefits of their comedic skill. If you watch the film while on your phone or doing anything else that pulls your attention from the film, even for a moment, you will completely miss the clever banter. I think that is why some people may have given this film a bad review. There is no reason one would not enjoy this film, as long as you aren't picking apart the story and expecting it to be a masterpiece like Shakespeare. You don't go to a Ghostbusters film for great literary fulfillment. This film was designed to make you laugh and give you a moment of escape and lightheartedness. I believe one could find holes in almost every plot in films and television these days, so give yourself a break, relax and use this film to enjoy some quick wit and fun action. I loved the various nods to the original film as well. Some of the outtakes and extended scenes I have seen that were cut should have been incorporated in the film because these four ladies have incredible comedic chemistry. Maybe if it were edited a little differently, it may have drawn more good reviews. Oh and Chris Hemsworth was a hoot! Who would have thought ""Thor"" could have played such a humorous role!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I remember watching this film as a kid and being blown away by how awesome it is. From the action, the characters and the chemistry between Leon and Mathilda it was just all so darn memorable and cool. Sure, the relationship between an adult hit-man and a 12 year old girl may sound like it's messed up. But Luc Besson makes the whole thing work by making the hit-man Leon to be so darn likable, professional and yet naive. This is the role that Jean Reno will be known for throughout his acting career. He plays this secluded, introverted and yet sensitive hit-man who is very likable for a hit-man. Maybe because of his naive personality and how he doesn't live a rich and fulfilled lifestyle because of what he does. Maybe it's because Leon is a character that has certain codes and rules that he abides by. And for a hit-man he has some integrity and compassion. Some of it comes from Jean Reno's personal idea to make his character a bit mentally slow when it comes to things that didn't involve killing. This movie was a big hit in Asian countries, especially in japan. And a some Japanese movies, anime and manga tried to emulate some elements from this film. The ideas about the character Leon and his relationship with Mathilda came about because of Luc Besson's personal relationship with a teenage girl who is much younger than he is. Even Gary Oldman puts on a very memorable performance as a corrupt cop. His performance might be a bit over the top, but it stuck with me and it works when it comes to the context of this film. This is Oldman's performance I mostly remember him for despite him being a great actor. It's close the the performance level of Denzel Washington from ""Training Day"". This is even the performance that made Natalie Portman who played Mathilda into a star. Again it's the performance I remember this actress the most for. She brings about a lot of raw emotions for a very young actress. The first door scene where she is trying to get inside Leon's apartment by saying ""please"" made me feel for her character. In another words, overall this is the film that I remember all three actors for the most. Mix that in with one of the best script that Luc Besson has written so far and you got one of the best movies from the 90's. What made this film very lasting, impactful and memorable for me wasn't just because of the cool style of it all. And because of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. But because it has one of the best ending I have ever seen in film. It's explosive figurative and literally when it comes to Leon's final mission. Overall, this is a brilliant film with marvelous acting, characters and direction. This is part action movie, part revenge movie and part controversial romance movie that doesn't take it too far. While having a bit of artistic ambiance to it without it being pretentious. I personally think of this film as a masterpiece.
10/10""It's been a number of years since the big crash that began in 2007/08, and despite appearances to the contrary, we are all still paying for the costs from that time. Government mishandling, regulatory body incompetence, banking misadventures and mortgage sellers fraudulence combined to create one of mankind's greatest synthetic disasters.
The underlying themes are complex to why it all happened, but as an introduction and understanding there has been little better as a package than this film. Having read the book, I'm happy that the film makers took the material as reference, and filmed this in their own way. It does a fine job in taking us thru the multitude of characters who are responsible for the disaster, explaining in some wonderful scenes the products behind the problems.
Whilst all this is happening, we are following a handful of people who take advantage having seen the truth behind the sham. Our mixed cast is given mostly equal billing with Brad Pitt (mostly unrecognisable), Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling playing their roles perfectly. The story takes time, but you will be gripped, despite already knowing the inevitable outcome.
This is an excellent introduction to the whole period, even if it is an uncomfortable viewing for many. Maybe this film will be better appreciated in a generation by those who didn't sit through the times. If you want Wolf of Wall Street, best move along, this is thankfully not that movie. Recommended viewing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** n 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate a break-in at the home of mathematician Alan Turing, whose suspicious behaviour and absence of war records causes Nock to believe that Turing may be a Soviet spy. The police send a man to follow Turing into a pub, where he hands an envelope to a male prostitute, who is arrested shortly afterward and confesses that Turing is a client. Staehl is ready to charge Turing with gross indecency, but Nock is still convinced that Turing is a spy, and begs Staehl to let him interrogate Turing for half an hour, whereupon the latter begins to disclose his top-secret activities during the war.
In 1939, after Britain declares war on Germany, Turing is accepted by Commander Alastair Denniston, of the Royal Navy, for a code-breaking job at Bletchley Park, working alongside Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. They are instructed to break the Enigma codes that the Germans use to encrypt their communications, which, as Maj Gen Stewart Menzies of MI6 explains, allows them to attack British and American shipping, leading to famine and the loss of life.""This was one of my favorites movies in 2016. I waited too long to see how Hills and Teller could complement on the big screen. And when I finally been able to see it, I was happy because it was all I had expected. Both of them shown previously that they can play drama roles (Moneyball and Whiplash, for example), but in this movie they proved that they can do it and be funny at the same time. The movie is similar in some aspects to The Wolf of Wall Street (where Jonah Hill made an excellent performance) and Hangover, but it never lose his own identity. So why should someone see this movie? You should see War Dogs if you want to see a funny, dramatic and entertained movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 a cease fire has been declared but as rumours of looted gold start to circulate a US soldier finds a map hidden on an Iraqi prisoner. It isn't long before four soldiers are heading into Iraq to liberate the gold for themselves. Once there they also find Shiite Iraqis who have followed American advice to rise up against the Saddam Hussein government and have now been abandoned to their fate at the hands of the Iraqi forces. They get their hands on the gold but there problems are only just beginning; one of them is captured and if they want to rescue him they will have to work with the rebels then help them get to safety in Iran.
When I first watched this I suspected it would be a remake of 'Kelly's Heroes'; thankfully, apart from the plan to get rich acquiring gold during a conflict, it is very different. There are lots of funny moments early on; some, such as the cow that explodes after stepping in a cluster bomblet, may be a bit dark for some people's taste. The laughs serve to make the more serious moments all the more shocking; when an Iraqi woman is shot in the head you know the tone of the film is taking a drastic change. There are disturbing scenes of torture where strangely it is hard not to feel some sympathy for the torturer as he relates what happened to his wife and child during a US bombing. The cast do a solid job; George Clooney is on good form as Archie Gates, the group's leader and is ably supported by Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze as the other four protagonists. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. The action scenes are exciting but manage to capture some of the horror of war without being too horrific it certainly doesn't have the gung-ho feeling of many such films; war is not glorified. Overall I'd say that, while this certainly won't be for everybody, I'd recommend those who enjoy a war film and like their humour fairly dark.""I bought a ticket to this movie on a whim. Knowing nothing about the premise or the actors, I went in blind with no real expectations outside of ""this feels like it would be a romantic comedy."" I came out of the theaters completely floored. The film was an emotional roller-coaster, in which the audience was able to commiserate with, celebrate alongside, and root for Kaira, the protagonist. The characters were solidly built, very consistent, and were a lot of fun to watch in interaction. Flashbacks were unobtrusive, and actually served the purpose of building characters out, rather than simply drawing the movie out. Cinematically stellar, purposeful, and nuanced; something that people from all cultures can enjoy. This film transcends Bollywood, and has themes of love, acceptance, support and the struggles of modern adult romance that we can all appreciate. I can comfortably say that this movie is a well crafted work, and deserves to be listed as an example for Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a solidly crafted romance film.""If you've never seen 'The Green Mile', then you need to at least once in your lifetime. A truly beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's book of the same name based in Death Row of an American prison between the 1920 and 1930'
The backdrop is a hot, unforgiving summer in what was the springtime of the guards lives. Led by Tom Hanks's character Paul Edgecomb, the men discover the extraordinary gifts of a prisoner by the the name of John Coffey who was to be executed for the rape and murder of two little girls. John was played by the late Michael Duncan Clarke, a man whose soulful demeanour and muscular build brought the adaptation of the character alive from the very first minute you meet him on screen. Despite John's size, his gentle demeanour and vulnerability soon reveals an extraordinary gift as Paul opens up to John about his urine infection. The guards set about utilising him to cure others.
The film brings to the fore the harsh reality of the guards duties whereby they walk the condemned prisoners to their eventual execution along the last walk of their lives along the green painted floor dubbed 'The Green Mile"".
The film depicts the array of emotions one would naturally expect, purveying the horrors of prison life, remorse and eventually death. Characters such as Wild Bill and Percy, both cruel and sadistic, thwart the lives of Paul, his men and prisoners under his charge.
John, whilst in transit, discovers that Wild Bill is the true murderer of the two girĺs for whom he'd eventually be executed for dispenses his own justice upon him. Percy, after deliberately sabotaging an execution of a prisoner, also receives a similar fate of his own when John infects him with a tumour thus leaving an inpatient of the local psychiatric hospital.
The film is tinged with both good times and sad, particularly when John is finally executed, breaking the spirits of Paul and the guards fortunate to have met him.
It truly is a piece of cinematic gold and needs to be watched from start to finish in its entirety, giving you an appreciation of life's trials and tribulations.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I read the book of Matilda, and was amazed when I saw it on amazon. I watched it, and was literally amazed at how epic it was. I was very pleased with the acting job. All the kids, even though they were small, were great! I saw Matilda on Broadway, and was almost driven to happy tears. This movie really makes you feel for Matilda, and feel for Ms. Honey. The Trunchbull is mean, scary, and cruel. She is always displayed like this, and I think that Pam Ferris was great! Plus, you can never beat Danny DeVito, and he is perfectly fit for the role as Mr. Wormwood. Bruce is always meeting trouble, and Jimmy Karz plays that perfectly. Plus, Ms. Honey is played as the opposite of the Trunchbull, and Embeth Davidtz played that perfectly. All things considered, this is the perfect movie to watch over and over. And when your done, consider listening to the original Broadway cast recording.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Let's start of by saying I played some video games back in my day I was quite the MASTER at being the second player and not knowing all the cool combos. I was the KING at complaining and whining that I didn't know any of the moves and characters. I was very SKILLED at handling my remote while I waited for my turn to play because my friends never died.
Even though I was not a gamer and I played only sometimes, I still saw some familiar faces in this movie (cameos galore). I recognized some cool video game characters that I was glad to see.
Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I liked it. Well actually I liked the second half of it. The first half was a bit slow and very establishing and fact filled, which is necessary but well, boring.
I always have a favorite side character in a movie and in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" the award goes to Sarah Silverman. As soon as she came into the picture the movie really began for me. This has nothing to do with my crush on Sarah Silverman. She actually did a great job playing an adorable little girl with a bit of a lovable potty mouth, not her usual role.
The only game I play is ""Call of Duty"" nothing else really interests me but hot damn I really hope they make some of the games they showcased in this movie. ""Sugar Rush"" looked like wicked fun.
Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says The marketing of this movie was not so hot. The posters are all wrong. The characters displayed are not the major players so don't expect anything from it. And the other poster with Ralph's 8 bit face? Even worse! This is one of the few movies I have seen without watching the trailer first and there is a reason for it. Digitally animated movies have the worst trailers. Challenge me on it I dare you! ""UP""? ""Finding Nemo""? They tell you nothing about the sentimental value they offer just a bunch of gags and slapstick! I mean find one good digitally animated movie trailer out there! Oh wait, I did it for you, it's this one. I avoid these trailers like math and now that I saw it I can honestly say they did a pretty good job.
The digital animation itself was not over the top either not too flashy not too fast and in your face. They had to really slow it down for the video game sequences and this forced the filmmakers to keep a nice flow.
Jack ""The Parent"" says duh? Take the kids! They will enjoy the wreck out of it! Like what I did there? They will enjoy it more if they have played video games. They will enjoy it more if you cry like a baby during special scenes and they look at you like you are some weird monkey donkey. Yeah it has some scenes so be careful if you are a softie!
On a side note there is a lot of name calling (they do it in a cute way) and some punching in the face violence (also done in a cute way) just had to throw it out there for you I mean my kids can take it and we all love that stuff but you never know.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** -- May contain spoilers --
This is an amazing movie I've watched This year, I really like the writing, the cast and everything about this movie, I love Rachel McAdams On her acting ... it's really something wonderful to travel in time for doing good thing, BUT also there something called Destiny we can't change the events and what will happened Next, About Time discuss this idea with a great way and a nice plot !

Thank you About Time, Thank you Richard Curtis For This Lovely Movie <3 I recommend this Movie ,, 9/10 !!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Action is not one of my favorite genres of film but I really enjoyed this movie.
The action was amazing, it was actual action, thrilling high-stakes action, not a fight scene. I'm not a fan of two robots fighting and destroying an entire city, or fist fights between people on top of a train or any of that stuff that's been overdone to death. Those scenes have one inevitable result and you're just waiting for it to happen.
In this film the driver has to keep the bus going, but there are numerous challenges as the roads are not empty. It subverts the hostage situation in films, where the captor is actually there, often surrounded by police, and negotiates with a negotiator for his safe passage and ransom.
Here the hostages are on a bus, the negotiator is on the bus, but the captor isn't. We don't know where he is, so the police cannot send a SWAT team to fix this. They actually have to use their brains for this puzzle. Even the location of this thing is not stationary, so the cops can't cordon off the block, they have to clear the roads as much as they could.
Hostage films are usually about police that follow protocol, usually with a rogue negotiator who thinks outside the box to do it his own way and save the day. This film is about a situation for which there is no protocol and they have to think on their feet.
That's why it's interesting and worth the watch.
I give it 8/10. There are some flaws, such as the bad guy being a cheesy, stereotypical villain, among others, but it still is a great film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Much has been said about Geoffrey Rush's incredible performance as David Helfgott, which launched him in the Hollywood stratosphere, but special mention must go to Chris Haywood as Sam, the owner of the Moby's, the restaurant where David really shines big time with his Rachmaninov.
Noah Taylor as the adolescent David is a standout, and it's good to see him make it big in Hollywood. I must admit I sometimes get Noah mixed up with Ben Mendelsohn, a fellow Australian actor, and they do share some resemblance.
Good to see Lynn Redgrave as David's wife. Lynn was excellent in the TV series House Calls co-starring with Wayne Rogers.""Reviewed August 2010
I was laughing out loud from start to end watching this. It is as good if not better than Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy. I am not sure how to be a critic for this movie, I'll do a simpler thing by writing a synopsis for it. All is executed well, if you like the concept there is no way you wouldn't enjoy it.
It is the story of 4 lead characters who play the crew of NSEA Protector and one extra 'Crew No. 6' of an age old Trekkie kind of show 'Galaxy Quest'. An alien race watches this show and assumes them to be historical documentation and gets impressed. They build their entire ship, it's systems and their ship culture based on what they saw on the show and even names it Protector 2. This alien race encounters a trouble which they feel they can't solve, so they come to earth in search of Protector's commander to help them. It's better I introduce a bit about the crew Tim Allen as the Commander who steals the show and it is always about himself. Sigourney Weaver as the pretty blond and her role is to repeat what the Ship Computer says. Alan Rickman is somewhat like Spock or similar character, but always have the resentment that Tim Allen steals the lines and focus from him. The tone of this character feels similar to Marvin the Robot from Hitchhikers.. which is also voiced by Rickman. Tony Shalhoub as the Chief Tech of the ship who has not forgot the lines or scenes of the show.
Sam Rockwell is an extra in one episode who gets to say 'Hey look some thing's up there' and get eaten by a monster. Now he is the presenter of the show but always regrets not being an active member. With these hilarious characters introduced, when the aliens approach Tim Allen, he assumes them to be organizers of some gig and says yes. Then starts the real deal where these lead actors has to do the real thing and Sam Rockwell just tags along. At the end when they have to surf through the ship to locate something, they get help from a bunch of geeks from Earth who are hardcore fans of the show who has all information as ships schematics, sequences, overrides etc.
It is a silly satire but also has a solid and funny script of it's own. The performances are guaranteed by looking at it's terrific cast and the production values are excellent for a comedy as they go all out in terms of ships and aliens look as well as the visual effects. I strongly recommend watching this movie if you have not already in case you are a sci-fi or a comedy fan.""This one was a real treat. --- Beforhand: I am not a movie expert. Neither am I a native speaker of English. I may fail to keep it simple for keeping it simple demands a native speaker's skills and command, I believe. ---
Trivial stuff first: Great cinematography at times. Great choice of moments to zoom in or out, such that the directing alone tells more about characters than it could in less skillful hands. This makes the characters feel more real.
Nice little pieces of music. Always in tune with the movie's momentary mood, imo.
---
As for the performances, I found it to be convincing enough to stay focused. Never did I feel the movie was forcing itself on me.
---
Scenario: Great script, overall. I seldomly felt that certain scenes required a more detailed content so as to clarify the protagonist's intent in taking a certain course of action: How, for instance, was he so quick to choose to continue to be a part of this crowd who previously had been so quick to pass judgments so critical that it could destroy a human being's life for good? How could someone possibly hope to be a part of something that became irreparably tainted, something nowhere near ""whole"" the way it was used to be, something that was shattered so badly that nothing good could come out of it any longer? Maybe, it is my personal concern that I have sought an answer to this. It is just as likely my concern that the only answer I could find is that a sincere hope to uncook a cooked egg is not so rare a psychological response of the common human mind as we hope it to be even when followed by an experience that frequently leads to a common appreciation of a negative relation between rationale and disappointment. Said another way, no matter how useless we know it is, we cannot help hoping for the impossible to happen.
---
Oh - great symbolism by the way. Not a unique one, but great all the same and what underlies its success is its ability to showcase a table-turning experience only to make a general statement rather than a case-specific one. Let me clarify a bit: The tables can turn for anyone, at any time and not necessarily in accordance with what some choose to call karma: because, yes, life is not fair, the world is not a fair place, it has never been one and we can acknowledge this fact yet still abhor it. Refraining from being part of any game will not absolve you off this universal rule, there is only one way from there on, and that is downhill.
If I am to let you in on what this movie is about, without giving away any spoilers as to the plot specifics, then I would say this movie has to do with an inclination to frame people (uninformedly) based on false accusations, sharing the guilt of these false accusations and becoming aware of it and the different ways in which people choose to cope with the shame that accompanies said awareness, thereby sealing the fate of the falsely accused: doubt ""you rather than me"", even if it means you will never be the same again because of my failure to be willing to pay the price - simply, my reluctance to atone.
The way the flick dwells on human nature and its tendencies as determined by its inadequacies wherein lies the inevitability of it all... is both depressing and relieving; the way confessions often are to a human being. It just cuts to the chase and makes us face up one of the main causes of insecurity: how we see things totally depends on where we stand, and where we stand might change in the blink of an eye, against our will. We are small, the world is large and, yes, although we like to pretend otherwise, the fact remains that we attribute too much of our content feelings to our free will and little to mere chance -those things we cannot control- but it is, indeed, the other way around.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Let me start off by saying 2 things: 1. I have played all the ""core"" Resident Evil games (1-6). 2. I like the 6 movies more than the 6 games.
Review for if you've played the game(s): The first Resident Evil movie starts off in the mansion much like the first game, but doesn't stay there long. Alice (the protagonist) (NOT in the games!) wakes up with no memory and ends up going below the mansion to a place called ""The Hive"" (Umbrella Corp's secret facility). Her and a group of Umbrella spec-ops are tasked with containing/killing a leaked virus before the infection spreads across the city above (and the rest of the world). There are of course zombies and ""lickers"" (from the games), but also an ""enemy"" called ""The Red Queen"" who is the security AI that locked down ""The Hive"" to contain the disease. In the end, Alice (and one other member) escapes to find Umbrella scientists waiting for them back in the mansion. Alice is taken to a lab in Raccoon City and her friend is put into the ""Nemesis Program"".
Review for if you HAVEN'T played the game(s): A girl named Alice wakes up with no memory in a fake mansion above a secret government facility. In this facility, a virus is spread and the facility is locked down by the AI running the place. Alice and some spec-ops agents must kill/contain the infected in order to prevent the spreading of disease to the city above (and the rest of the world).
FINAL VERDICT: If you're into action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls or all of the above, you'll like this movie. If you are a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil video games (especially the first one), you may not.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Talking to a fellow IMDber about what his top film of 2016 was,I got told about a tantalising Korean Horror epic that he had seen at a film festival. Deciding to hold a 2016 Horror double bill viewing this weekend (with the other being the gritty Brit zombie title The Girl with All the Gifts) I booked a ticket for the Busan train.
The plot:
Putting all his attention on work, Seok-Woo barely sees his daughter Su-an.Sick of hardly seeing her dad,Su-an demands Seok-Woo to take her to Busan,so that Su-an can spend her birthday with her mum/his ex- wife. Taking it on the chin,Seok-Woo books the tickets for him and his daughter. Just before the train departs,a convulsing women jumps on the train.Noticing a large bite mark,Seok-Woo,Su-an soon find their destination to change from Busan to a zombie apocalypse.
View on the film:
Spending (most) of a two hour running time on a train,writer/director Sang-ho Yeon turns down a comfy seat to lay the track for a white-knuckle ride. Drawn away from Anima for his live action debut,Yeon & cinematographer Hyung-deok Lee brilliantly close the passengers to the chaos on board with ultra-stylish claustrophobic shots,which look from above at the limited room the passengers have for zombie-free air. Mounting up the zombies,Yeon brilliantly chews practical,in-camera effects with CGI shrieks,howling from Yeon keeping the gore to a minimum,to instead carve out an anxiety-drench Horror atmosphere,spun from the disturbing fast/slow spider-like movement of the undead.
Watching the world die out as they drive by,the screenplay by Yeon eats up spectacular horror set-pieces with precisely hit personal human tragedy. Taking pit stops on the way to the poetic final destination,Yeon rolls the zombies in with piles of them darting all over the empty stations,with the unlucky pick-ups the train makes leading to some tasty shocks. Looking in at every carriage,Yeon cleverly uses the sweet drama between Seok Woo and Soo-an (played by the fantastic Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim) as a foundation to keeping a close watch at how everyone on the other carriages fight to keep the zombie train on track.""This film was a lot of fun! A suburban couple dedicated to their kids, careers and cul-de-sac neighborhood have their orderly lives upended by new neighbors who seem a bit larger than life and turn out to be just that. The film has fun with the characters (whose personalities drive a lot of the humor), their reactions to their changing situations, with everyone trying to keep their priorities straight. The conventions of spy movies are entertainingly employed and spoofed. Overall, a good mix of humor and action, and also has a sense of respect for all the characters.
Being in a similar stage of life and circumstances to the main characters (minus the car chases, explosions and such) likely added to the enjoyment.""Three years ago I saw an ad for The Croods on my peach juice jug and I thought it looked really dumb. I was very wrong.
This movie is beautifully animated. The environnements are very well made and the tiger is the best. It's very fun to watch a movie like this that is so well animated.
This movie stars Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds. Yeah. That's a cast. Everyone is great and awesome but Nic Cage steals the show. I won't spoil anything but there's lots of character development around his character.
The Croods has great animation and a great cast but that's almost nothing compared to the message. The message is about change and how you can't always stay in one place and not evolve. This message is delivered extremely well in this prehistoric era.
This movie was also really funny. The humour is fresh and good. I heard the sequel was cancelled which is extremely disappointing because the end left us with a lot of ground to explore and more adventures to go on.
All in all, The Croods is pretty much a perfect animated movie. It has great animation, a great cast, a nice setting that helps deliver the powerful message and it's funny. I will be reviewing more animated movies soon which will lead to my best animated movies list.""I loved this film. The three tales are so revealing about dominating social themes at the time they were written - the need for a male heir, the dangers of patriarchal eccentricity, the obsession with youth when forty was old - but they rise above their times and achieve universal relevance, and they are enriched with magic, monsters and the bizarre. The cinematography and music are wonderful and the locations gorgeous, especially Castel del Monte and Donnafugata. Making the movie was pure chutzpah, there is no way it would appeal to a mass audience. There is no closure, just the posing of questions about the meaning of what we have seen. Great stuff, and I wish other directors would have a go at such seductive material, though I fully understand why they don't!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS I put off watching this due to how many bad reviews I saw and how many people I came across that had nothing to say about it other than to mock it. But I finally sat down to watch it while answering some emails and quickly found the emails completely forgotten.
This isn't a jump and scare type of horror, and I personally found the times the Babadook was crawling around a bit funny. If you base the movie off of him alone it looks like another sorta bad sorta funny horror. The children's book was scarily adorable and I want it, and I've found myself walking around the house saying, 'Ba ba dook dook dook,' all night.
That all alone made it an okay movie. But what made it good was every other bit. The way he lurks in the shadows always had you nervous every time there was a dark corner. The way the little boy annoys the hell out of you at first then wins you over with how pathetic he is. It nearly broke my heart when he was trying to tell his mommy he was hungry and there was no food in the fridge. The way friends and family react to them is so uncomfortable and just really gets you into the story. The mother takes every idea of depression you can have and plays them beautifully. The real story and the real horror is the relationship between them and the lows it reaches at times. I feel like they could have gone more into detail with certain bits, like the home visit that ended so quickly. The ending had a bit of a twist but still left you uneasy and rather sad for everyone the entire time.
Well worth the watch even if the dinosaur noises were a bit distracting."This movie is amazing. Its practical effect and visual effects still holds up today the story is amazing I will not go into it to avoid spoilers but this film definitely takes on a darker tone then then a new hope and return of the Jedi this is one of the best movies ever made and by far the best star wars movie. With twits and turns all around this movie is definitely worth a watch. If you haven't seen any of the star wars movies I would recommend watching them in release order as it saves some information that is spoiled in the prequels. Also watching the prequels is not necessary as it ruins some concepts that were prominent in the original trilogy"I've seen reviews of this that say ""poor depiction of the 70's"", ""the daughter ruined the whole thing"", ""the characters are poorly shaped"" - all valid if you're eager to see this movie as a failure even before you've watched the first five minutes.
What I saw was one of the funniest cop/detective comedies since The Other Guys, starring a duo with just as much potential as Chan and Tucker in Rush Hour.
After recent memory was soiled with all sorts of awful Kevin Hart/The Rock combos, The Nice Guys was a breath of fresh air. Crowe and Gosling were solid and clearly enjoyed the whole thing, and while the script may have been found lacking at times, it was the humor (and arguably Gosling's overacting) that saved the day every single time.
Those of you watching this in the States, I beg you: if you've lived through the 70's, watch this without judging the setting too much. It wasn't meant as an accurate biopic, and looking for flaws will just ruin your experience.
Look out for some old school references and be prepared for a whole lot of random humor. As stated above, I would see this morphing into a trilogy, similar to Rush Hour. All it needs is the right follow-up and a script that keeps playing on Crowe's and Gosling's abilities.
8/10 - would definitely watch again, easily a solid addition to the weekend movie shelf.""This movie did not promise much but it ended up deserving my congratulations. Traveling out of the body, sleeping or hypnosis, is a rare theme in horror films and has given body to the film in an elegant and solid way. The film does not allow us to have an immediate perception of what is really happening, and this helps to lengthen the suspense and mystery around it, which gradually becomes more intense, grabbing the audience. James Wan, the director, made his reputation with the ""Saw"" franchise, which I do not appreciate for being too graphic. Apparently, this director is truly capable of doing horror without resorting to liters of false blood. Lin Shaye is the most notable actress in the film, with a strong presence and a charisma built on experience and talent, but Patrick Wilson, in the role of Josh, was also at ease and made a good performance, in harmony with Rose Byrne. The film has an interesting ending, although without the intensity that we could be expecting. Another thing I find pleasant is the use of cinematic solutions that are alternative to the avalanche of special effects that we are used to, as it was done for the evil entity or when it was decided to show ""The Further"" as a dark and misty place. The sound effects, a classic haunted house setting and a purposefully gray cinematography do the rest and make this movie worth remembering. Refined and elegant, the film still uses some usual clichés in the horror and haunting films, but does so in the right way and so convincingly that it ends up being another plus point in this great quality film.""In search of the final nail in the coffin of the sordid cultural relevance of Edward and Bella? Look no further than the supremely delightful What We Do in the Shadows. Here, newbie vampire Nick drunkenly parades himself through the streets of Wellington, braying ""I AM TWILIGHT"" as a pick up line, only to be greeted with blank looks of vague derision. It's pristine satire - gently but insistently raucous, and playing more off of Nick's incredulous 'Isn't this cool anymore' expression than the gag itself. And the best bit? It's only one of a nearly nonstop smorgasbord of sneakily clever, deliciously quotable gags the film offers.
If Shaun of the Dead's 'rom-zom-com' infused the zombie horror genre with a much- needed surge of frantic humour and schlubby humanity, What We Do in the Shadows blends vampires, who have already been subjected to oodles of daft action and risible romance, with The Office's mockumentary deadpan and a thoroughly New Zealand 'no bullsh*t' ethos, to similarly sterling effect. Co-director/stars Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi may thrive in 'chortle-funny' rather than the deep belly-laugh kind, but the chortles come so incessantly and raucously, they provide just as much of an ab workout. When you finally acclimatize to the spry wordplay, (""we are werewolves, not swear-wolves!""), lovingly integrated pokes at other vampire lore (including the bad etiquette of attending a vampire costume ball dressed as Blade, despite the fact that apparently ""Vampires love Wesley Snipes!""), and faux-historical interludes (apparently Naziism was just as controversial within vampire circles), you think you might find rest. But it's only moments before you're blindsided again by interludes involving a pair of impossibly stupid police officers, or laughs as unobtrusive as a cutaway to Waititi playing a mournful trumpet. The film is nonstop, evidencing a breezy, cheerful humour that is too earnest not to love.
It helps that Waititi and Clement wear their hearts on their sleeves, with an uncanny ability to tease out the silliness in vampire lore while still committing to the emotion at the heart of it. There's an undercurrent of deep, anachronistic loneliness imbued in the film's leading trio of bloodsuckers, which somehow makes their interludes of squabbling over the (five years) overdue dishes, or forlornly learning how to use Facebook all the funnier in their sweetness. Similarly, in this realm of immortal horror monsters, death comes fast, furious, and with unapologetic bluntness, and the cheerful interjections of staggering bloodiness that sprinkle throughout the film (sometimes quite inconveniently getting all over the furniture), or omnipresent threat of the documentary crew getting devoured, keep the fun appropriately gruesome throughout. In terms of cohesiveness, there's no question that the film is unapologetically episodic, like a prolonged sitcom episode or beefed up SNL sketch, but Waititi and Clement keep things nimble enough to keep the joke from wearing thin, before calling it quits with a chipper non-climax that's so nonchalant, it's only retroactively that it feels like it delivers the loose resolution you'd hope for. And, honestly, material this hilarious earns all of the clumsy non-sequiturs it can muster.
Still, the film's ruthless silliness and sweetness consolidate into the perfect cocktail (presumably a blood-tini) in the hands of the effortlessly funny cast. As the ageless, effete dandy and tentative moral compass of the group, Waititi himself is massively adorable, pairing bug-eyed cheeriness with a cartoon Dr. Strangelove accent to tremendous effect. Similarly, Clement commits his post-Concords star power perfectly towards the enormous presence of his larger-than-life, crestfallenly ineffectual Vlad the Impaler. Jonny Brugh's scene-chewing rock star arrogance is all the funnier once paired with the clueless boorishness of Cori Gonzalez-Macuer or the indignantly neurotic Jackie van Beek as scene partners. Finally, Stuart Rutherford redefines the potential of the comedic deadpan as impossibly unflappably software analyst (and very human) Stu,* while Rhys Darby (don't call him Murray) is as reliably hilarious as ever, cameoing as an exasperated werewolf.
Thoroughly sweet, disarmingly sad, cheerfully bloody, and infectiously watchable, What We Do in the Shadows proves one of a preciously slim caste of horror spoofs with genuine wings. While it's inevitably prime material to be gobbled up by Flight of the Conchords converts, it's also accessibly goofy enough to stand alone as one of the most unobtrusively funny sleeper hit comedies of the past several years. Just be cautious not to falsely publicize the film amidst the lingering forces of Twihards, or risk incurring Clement and Waititi intoning that these are vampires, not tramp-ires. Zing.
-9/10
*Also, did you realize ""Don't eat Stu!"" was a pun? Because I didn't until long after the credits rolled. What a delightful film.""Georgia, early-1860s. Scarlett O'Hara's life is one of parties and romantic machinations. She lives on her family's plantation Tara and the love of her life, Ashley Wilkes, has just announced his engagement to Melanie Hamilton. However, she soon is married to Charles, Melanie's younger brother, though she doesn't love him. Then the Civil War intervenes, and once the South starts losing, survival becomes the priority. All this time, one man keeps popping back into Scarlett's life, the dashing Rhett Butler.
Every bit the classic and epic it is made out to be. Epic in its span of events, epic in its running time, epic in its scale, epic in production. Interesting, engaging story that is part romance, part war drama, part triumph of the will drama, all with a few good themes thrown in.
Has given cinema some of its most enduring scenes and lines.
Won the Best Picture Oscar in 1940. Won 7 other Oscars too including Best Director for Victor Fleming, Best Actress for Vivien Leigh and Best Supporting Actress for Hattie McDaniel, the first African- American to win an Oscar (also the first to be nominated).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I think It will always be remembered how controversial the filming of The Great Dictator was, I mean given that It was essentially putting political satire against Adolf Hitler, It was always going to receive a certain level of heat before It's release, but that doesn't stop Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator from being one of his many, many classics. The Great Dictator also stands out as being one of the first Chaplin made movies with sound, and It really makes The Great Dictator all the more enjoyable. Essentially the plot revolves around a Jewish barber that bares a strong resemblance to not Hitler, Adenoid Hynkel. The barber after getting wounded in the war comes back to his home town after a hospital stay, he then gets infuriated with the way Hynkel's forces are operating and joins a group of rebels with Hannah played by Paulette Goddard and several others. Of course the real highlight of The Great Dictator is the barber's speech at the end of the movie as he poses as Hynkel in front of the armies, this speech is where Chaplin really demonstrated just how fine of an actor he was, throughout the entire speech It still leaves me in an intense state during the whole thing. It has you hanging on every word as Chaplin dominates. Obviously the movie is stuffed full of brilliant comedy moments but what really makes The Great Dictator a masterpiece is the demonstration that Chaplin was capable of being a great serious actor too. The Great Dictator is truly a beautiful film through and through.""A moving, timeless classic that has been so sensitively done for the real victims of the war. A brilliant cast that is led by Liam Neeson. This was the first film I saw him in and he grabbed my attention immensely. I couldn't possibly think of anyone else who could play his role. The film takes you on a roller-coaster of emotion and despite being a long film, I found myself to be totally absorbed and invested in it from start to finish. I found that I that I really started to care about the characters and the poignant decision o the director to keep the little girl in colour is so powerful and heart breaking. I highly recommend this film as a real insight in to the horrors of this war and the hell people had to go through just to survive for their religion.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If film noir was not a genre, but a hard man on mean streets with a lost lovely in his heart and a gat in his gut, his nightmares would look like ""Sin City."" The new movie by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller plays like a convention at the movie museum in Quentin Tarantino's subconscious. A-list action stars rub shoulders with snaky villains and sexy wenches, in a city where the streets are always wet, the cars are ragtops and everybody smokes. It's a black-and-white world, except for blood, which is red, eyes which are green, hair which is blond, and the Yellow Bastard.

I actually had no idea when I was watching it until the credits, where they show it off a little. (Apparently, they used 3D printers and other software to achieve this level of stop motion animation.) I'm in awe.
But of course it's not the technical achievement that makes a movie. What makes a movie like this is the gorgeous visual appeal, the terrific acting (especially by Charlize Theron), the touching, engaging screenplay, the characters, and the sense of magic appearing before us.
This is at times quite dark, although leavened with humor, but it manages to keep away from being depressing, giving a sense of wonder and possibility to even the most melancholy scenes.
Anyway, terrific movie, you should watch it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I enjoyed this movie much as a child and loved it even more as an adult. It has many, many great lessons for those looking for the answers to life. The best lesson was that lying and not remaining true to yourself is a mistake that will be overcome by true love. The movie was one of the best Disney movies and the animation revealed much about the state of the characters, like how truthful Aladdin was being, how evil Jafar was, how innocent Jasmine is, and how Iago was mean.
GENIE!!! Is the favorite part! We love Genie and all his magic! He is the embodiment of truth in the movie and shows how God will intervene, even when hope is lost by giving truths to the Hero in ways that seem impossible. This is true fact.
I give the movie 10/10 for Awesome Perfect Truth Revealing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I really enjoyed watching Hidden Figures. The story was compelling and laid out neatly for our viewing pleasure. It shone a spotlight on a part of history with which I wasn't familiar. And, most importantly, it made me want to learn more about Katherine Goble Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. What a shame the screenwriters felt they had to preach at me about racism rather than just tell the true story of these amazing and talented women. They weren't amazing and talented ""in spite"" of being black or ""in spite"" of being women, they were just amazing and talented in their own right. One day, perhaps, Hollywood will get a clue and give audiences credit for having a brain.
Much of the atmosphere of racism in the movie did not ring true for me. In many cases it didn't even make sense, so I looked into it. The first question I had for the internet was ""Did Katherine Goble have to run half a mile to use a bathroom on the NASA complex?"" The answer is no. For more info on the conditions and life of Katherine Johnson check out the interview with her here: https://youtu.be/r8gJqKyIGhE. In particular check out 11:49 where she says she ""didn't feel segregation"". Everyone was working. The job was important and they weren't going to jeopardize the mission with foolish racist antics. She was part of a team. I would've liked to have heard so much more about Katherine and her mind and work, less about the social issues of the 1960s!
I understand that screenwriters have to condense a large amount of information into a couple of hours but the ham-handed and, let's be honest, false representation of racism at NASA and the treatment of these women was a repeated and unwelcome intrusion into, what should have been, a very interesting and educational movie about these remarkable women. For example: I strongly suspect Katherine Goble never, ever would have been so unprofessional as to scream at her boss and co-workers like she does in (what Hollywood probably sees as) a ""cathartic"" scene. It was completely out of character and a distraction from what should have been the real story, that of Katherine's accomplishments. Goble was a professional and intelligent woman who would've never done such a thing which, to my way of thinking, says a lot more about her than such a silly, manufactured scene. But I don't want to run the risk of being just as ham-handed in my review and I'll leave my criticism at that. I'll only add, don't let the prospect of being bludgeoned by an anti-racist message keep you from going to see Hidden Figures.""When I started watching this movie, I was wondering why so much focus on the young Saroo but the camera was just brilliant and background score held me up and I was kind of glued to the whole movie. Superb acting, brilliantly directed and those flashbacks were just outstanding. Finally something really nice and Mature acting from Deb Patel and I will be looking forward for some more brilliant performances like this in future. This movie made me realize or it's a wake up call for me to somewhere I have to also get those dead ends open and move on. Hats off. Not to mention Nicole, she was just fantastic and fabulous, there was a moment when tears started flowing and I did not realize why but that was just something amazing what an actress has an effect on you.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Yet another perfect movie from the perfectionist. Dangal gives you a peek in to people's lives who have a commitment towards sport and passionate towards nation but also the problems they face while they fulfill their dreams. Entire cast Aamir, Sakshi, Fatima, Saanya, Zaira and Suhani did an excellent job and justice to their roles. Needless to say Aamir excels to do what he is good at and keeps you occupied with his intense acting. The female leads (especially the younger and older Geeta) were awesome in their roles when it comes to the tackle scenes be it in the mud or on the turf. The camera work capturing fights in the bout needs a special mention here as they stand out and gives you a treat of a real combat between two wrestlers. For those who saw the trailers multiple times the first half is an easy guess about what happens next, but otherwise the movie is excellent piece of work by the entire crew of Dangal. Full marks to the Director, Aamir and his girls.""The two great lawyers, Phil Hirschkop and Bernie Cohen, actually did most of the things for Richard and Mildred Loving, because the Loving couple do not have a good sense of law. In fact, the lawyers and the Loving couple jointly change the history of the US, in the sense that the prohibited marriage based on race became unconstitutional due to the Loving vs. Virginia case.
Also, the acting of Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga is so compelling and natural. It just feels so real. At the same time, the music is great, and the film is thrilling and heartwarming. The story-telling is a little tedious, but that's fine.""This Film looks incredibly beautiful!
In the first ~5 minutes I teared up!
The score is beautiful, the songs (You can really feel the participation of Lin Manuel Miranda!), the animations and it's all very authentic! I loved this movie.
The comparison to Avatar comes easily, because the only thing this movie is missing is a complex story, still the storytelling is fantastic! I can promise you, whoever you are, you will love this! It's beautiful in every way!
The Oscar nominations are absolutely deserved and I can only hope they'll get at least 1 (Best animated film/best original song)!
The humor was cute and subtly done, and got me laughing a few times! go watch it, you won't regret it!""This movie is one of the best movies ever made. don't understand why this movie gets bashed so much because it's ""overrated."" So what? Pretend as though you never heard anyone say how good this film is, then watch it, and then talk to me. And don't even get me started on people saying, ""People like it just because Heath Ledger died!"" Again, pretend as though he didn't die, watch his performance again, and then come talk to me. An outstanding performance by anyone who was ever involved in this film.Amazing performance by Heath Ledger. Cool beyond cool. That's why I loved it. But I can fully understand why someone would not enjoy such a dark film, oh except for that one guy who gets driven insane.""This movie reminded me of those early 1960's movies with Marlon Brando like On the waterfront and Streetcar Named Desire. A movie about a workingman's life. I felt like I knew the characters from the people I was around years ago. A tale about the flaws in ourselves and in our families and overcoming the pain of life. Somehow today things aren't the same...maybe because life is easier and we have so much more to enjoy- TV, cell phones, computers and cars that we don't spend as much time getting to hate each other as much. To live day in and day out with each others sins and trying to forgive them was what families did. The thing is our fathers weren't the only ones to blame, we all have done things we are not proud of. That is how we learn to forgive and to remember all of us are better than the worse things we do.""Disney Animation ruled the box office with both Zootopia and Finding Dory crossing $1 Billion but it's Moana which will be hailed as Disney Classic. Just like Disney is Making Live-Action version of its animated classic , Moana will be the first Modern one to get that treatment. I was just left speechless and didn't wanted this movie to end. First of all , it's the magic of Disney. To cultivate the culture of Polynesian , I have never seen it on big screen and it was magical. It made me want to go out to that place and enjoy the rich culture of such wonderful people. I don't know why Moana couldn't earn as much as others , still a huge hit. Starting from the story itself , it's adventurous and full of mythical elements and so close to nature. The Characters well Moana is my Favorite Disney Princess (sorry Elsa)just because early Disney Princess have always played it along their comfort zone and they knew what they are doing but Moana is all about finding about yourself , the journey of knowing your true self. Dwayne The Rock as Maui is instantly likable and humorous. The Best thing about this movie is the voice of Auli'i Cravalho and the soundtrack by Lin Manuel Miranda. The songs especially How Far I'll Go and We Know the Way Captures what this story is all about. Disney is making such great films this way. On one hand where pixar is more about hitting the heart and maturity Disney is the one and especially through this film , it is the one that reminds me of what Disney movies are like, just plain Magic. Many people believe animated movies are for kids but hey I am 18 year old man and I can't stop praising this movie. Forget about the Direction or Script it is the magical impact that Moana lefts us behind which is the best part of this movie. Also the last time I saw female lead actually play the female lead in a movie was Hidden Figures so hats off to that too. Towards the end as it was ending I didn't wanted it to end. Based on such rich themes the end for me was PERFECT in every way I could imagine and Disney managed to put a very strong message about Environment through this which is also amazing. One more thing is the much modernized and ver nice quality animation.Every leaf, ever drop of eater , every strand of hair is crafted with much details which clearly shows the hard work of so many hours. As speaking for Oscars , there is stiff competition From Zootopia as well as City of Stars from La La Land but for me it's already the best of the year.Go on Disney Make more movies like this with such awesome soundtrack. I also hope Lin Manuel Miranda gets the much deserving MacPEGOT (He has MacArthur Foundation , Pulitzer , Emmy , Grammy and Tony) so only Oscar is left . I do hope he wins for How Far I'll go.Well Even if he doesn't he is starring in Mary Poppins returns , and Giving Music for The Little Mermaid among others so it's a win- win for him. Finally, MOANA is one of those self discoveries about oneself that needs to be watched, it's epic it's SIMPLY CLASSIC.""This movie is just the best. Especially for pet lovers. At first I thought it would be too childish for me to watch but the pure fun of it makes it enjoyable for any age.
It's one of those movies where you fall in love with all the characters or you have a ""favourite"". Duke is my favourite and wow the guy behind Duke, Eric Stonestreet did an amazing job without his role it wouldn't have been the same.
I've watched it 4 or 5 times now that's how much I love it. It offers so much, great characterisation on top of the characteristics of different animals makes this movie so much fun to watch.
There are so many parts to the movie, no boring bits. It's an all-out animation adventure with so much amusing details and no nuance left unanimated you'll sure be entertained.""I very rarely write reviews, but after watching this movie I felt compelled to do so. I admit I did not want to watch this movie when I first heard about it and saw some of the previews for it. In a way it kind of angers me that people want to make movies about these real life terroristic acts (especially against the USA). I feel as though it makes these evil (fill in the blank with any cuss word you so choose) martyrs and brings unnecessary attention to terrorism. And oh look it's Mark Wahlberg in another movie about Boston what a surprise. But I was bored tonight and I do enjoy Mark Wahlberg in his natural habitat (Boston) associated movies, so I gave it a watch. I was blown away. I learned a lot more about the specific events of that tragedy than I originally knew. I thought the director did an excellent job of telling the story without using racism. I loved how they showed the investigation and how they set up the location where they conducted the investigation. I laughed, I cried, I was astounded at the action and fight scenes. It was wonderfully done. I just wish it wasn't true. And for the record, I'm a Flight Medic and NREMT for my local healthcare system so I appreciate when movies like this are well done. It's really a feel good story about a national tragedy.""Awesome film, with something for everyone, lots of very funny scenes, tonnes of great stunts, good family themes and plot, and even the Monster truck fans will love the outragous actions of Creech and the trucks.
So while the world and everyone is worried about idiots, terrorists and Armageddon...along comes a great film like this to brighten the outlook of the world....should be more films like this! This film had the same feel that I got back in the 80s watching ET for the first time.
The film is fantastically rounded, and a film where every character gets exactly what they deserve, that leaves the viewer satisfied that there is still Kama and justice in the world.
You walk away from the cinema thinking I got good value for money on that film.
Enjoy""After reading the critics I was not sure whether I should see it, but I did and it exceeded my expectations! It was wonderful! The visuals were amazing. I loved the acting, especially Mia. It is a movie for those with imagination. It kept me interested the whole time. And contrary to some reviews I read, I actually liked that the soundtrack is somewhat similar to Alice in Wonderland, because it brought an even bigger connection to the movies, by using old motives and bringing new elements and making variations out of them. Don't listen to the critics, and go see it without having any expectations.
. . .""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First, this movie has many flaws. This is not the greatest movie ever made in India. This is not 3 Idiots or Dangal .So stop comparing.
I will try to be as honest as possible. How many times it has happened while watching a SRK movie that you forget SRK the superstar and witness the character played by him. Very Few. May be a Kabir Khan,may be a Mohan Bhargav or may be Sunil or Aman. Out of a filmography which stretches beyond 60,you remember only half a dozen. But this film will add Raees to that list. Shahrukh is so considered over-rated by people here in India and to some extent sometimes even I did. But make no mistake, he is the greatest actor of out times. May be he needs better scripts and directors who make use of his talent(Not Farah Khan or Rohit Shetty who took most of his fan-base).
Coming to the film,this film is so far from perfect.The VFX in an action scene will make you cringe. Having said so, I will tell you to observe some scenes in the movie and decide for yourself if SRK is the greatest actor of our times. If you don't agree ,just dislike my review.
1. When Raees goes to kill Jayraj in the den. With the backdrop of Laila song,he comes and takes revenge. Those 3 shots fired, that scene itself shows why SRK was never in the movie. That intensity,that anger, that hopelessness..He emotes everything with his expression and eyes.
I have never seen him like this.
2. The Riot Scene:- Raees is outstanding here. Credit to Mohanan,the way he has portrayed it. ""Kaun Mai Ka Laal Hai"" ""Kaun Mai Ka Laal Hai"" ""Kaun Mai Ka Laal Hai""..Holy Sh*t.He owned this scene
3. The Phone Scene:- Raees calls the minister to request not to take his election rally through his neighborhood. To which the minister very rudely declines. Just see the intensity of Raees in those 3 redials he does to the minister.
4. The Last Conversation between Raees and Inspector Majmudar inside police van.
5. There are so many.I want to write but that would be giving so much.""Loved the story ESPECIALLY the end! Perfect!! I am a DOG LOVER and this movie explains why! Dogs make life worth living! If you have ever had to send a dog on to heaven , this makes it all make sense!! Dogs just get it! The saddest part for me was the dog chained in the backyard but his RELEASE was EXCELLENT! Job well done!!! I'm ready for #2! I just realized Peggy Lipton from MOD SQUAD was Hannah all grown up! I loved seeing her again! I would recommend this to all ages! The previews before this movie were lame but A Dog's Purpose was WELL WORTH The WAIT! I will be watching it on Netflix again and again! I did not read the book but loved, loved, loved this movie.""LION is the story of a boy, Saroo, who goes missing for 25 years from his Indian home.
This film plays on the emotions of loneliness, sadness, regret, and acceptance to convey the journey that Saroo is experiencing. It may teeter on the edge of over-doing it with it's grand and sweeping score and crying followed by hugs, yet it ends up being quite justified, considering this is an extraordinary true story.
The acting in the film is very well executed. Nicole Kidman shines as the loving and confused mother of Saroo and his brother, Mantosh. Kidman smiles through the pain of the absence of Mantosh, and sometimes Saroo, as well. Sunny Pawar holds his own very strongly for the first hour of LION. He's fun-loving and charismatic, and also distraught, closed off, and alone. Pawar is virtually the only character for a good part of this film, up until Kidman comes into play, and he is phenomenal. Dev Patel is able to to portray the still-lingering feelings of loss and abandonment while trying to stay true to his adoptive family. Patel wrestles these emotions and emotes frustration off of the scree. Finally, Rooney Mara's character. I am a firm and unmoving Rooney Mara supporter; I believe she is a fantastic and understated actress who knows how to pick a film to star in (exlcuding PAN). There's no doubt that she is great in LION and that she does all the she can with what she has here; the problem is that there's not a lot there. Mara's character barely progresses the story along and is only there to add frustration and support to Dev Patel's character. I understand she was an important figure in Saroo's life so the film can't just completely exclude her, yet it almost brushes her aside, just like the adoptive father character. It's a shame to see Rooney's full talent go unused.
Overall, this is crowd-pleasing, emotional, and investing film that uses all of it's emotion button-pushing with just the right amount. Paired with beautiful cinematography, a riveting score, powerful performances, and an ending that will stay with you; LION proves to be one of the better films of 2016.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Denzel Washington at his usual finest. Viola Davis Oscar worthy! Not to take away from the supporting cast but... Wow, she is amazing.
While to some, the play adaptation may seemed cramped on the big screen, I believe this intentional. After all, we're talking about people living such a tight existence the only thing left between them is the shards of their broken dreams and one small unfinished backyard fence.
Bitterness wrapped up in resignation, hope squashed at every turn, plus an ageing victim compelled to destroy the spirit of youthful ambition. Unaware of the cycle he's repeating.
Absolutely beautiful to watch as a middle aged man come to terms with his own failures, demons, and temptations; not to mention the lives caught in his wreckage.
We can literally feel the heartache on screen. This is raw, emotional vulnerability- understated yet powerful as it builds. Only at the end do we see the redemption and love that remains.""DEEPWATER HORIZON is about as good of a disaster movie as I think I have ever seen. Recounting the tragedy in 2010 in which an oiler rig caught fire and claimed the lives of 11 men on board, the movie follows the events in sequence as an ensemble cast brings to life one of the most horrific events I think I could ever imagine. Stuck in a fire is bad, but imagine being stuck in a fire 45 minutes from land, with the ocean 3 miles deep below you? That's terror.
The movie is told from the perspective (mainly) of one man, Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), who is now regarded as a hero for his quick-thinking and rescue of several of the crew on board. We are introduced first to his family. His wife, a stunning Kate Hudson, and his whip-smart daughter who wants her dad to find a fossil at sea for bragging rights at school. Before Williams leaves at work, the daughter demonstrates the way an oil rig works using a can of soda and a metal straw. Like that scene in Titanic where a computer generation simulates the entire sinking of the ship so that the audience knows what to expect, so does this throwaway scene give us a rudimentary knowledge of the happenings on the rig later on. When they are talking about cement and pipes and negative pressure, we have less cause to question what is happening. It's brilliant filmmaking.
On board, we meet the rest of the crew, captained by Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell), who argues constantly with the BP executives on board about cutting corners. The construction of the pipeline leading to the ocean's floor is already 43 days behind, and construction is abruptly finished to cut corners and save the multi-billion dollar company a little money. BP is, of course, the villain of this story since their actions led to the largest oil spill in US history. The face to the company is John Malkovich playing a conniving investor with a Cajun accent and knack for time saving. His dialogue with Russell is great, and we see the rival sides of two arguments: the crew is trying to work in the safest environment possible. BP wants the job done on schedule.
The events on board play out in the course of 24 hours or so. We meet the workers on board, all chummy and casual with each other. They practice songs with each other, joke, work like friends... The atmosphere is that of comfort, and there is lots of clever writing in the way small talk turns into startling character development and the candor of speech places these characters so specifically in southern Louisiana.
All the while we see bubbles slowly rising from the ocean floor, an omen of what is to come. When performing a standard 'negative pressure test' to gauge the strength of the newly-built pipe, a surge of pressure forces mud and natural gas to erupt into the Horizon with the force of a bomb. The facility fills with gas, and the overdrive of engines causes an explosion. In the darkness, we see massive amounts of black oil rise into the sky thousands of feet above the platform. With a spark, it is ignited... The entire ship is a floating firebomb.
Luckily many survive, and the action once the flames start is less plot driven and more or less a fight to escape. With Mark Wahlberg's character, he is knocked unconscious in his bed chamber and must work through the darkness to find safely. Kurt Russell, caught in the explosion in the shower, is nearly blinded and impaled by shards of glass and metal. It's utter chaos.
The most effective aspects of this film (and there are many) is the set piece of the Deepwater Horizon, itself. It has been called the most expensive movie set ever built, and watching the movie I would never have second-guessed that this was not a real rig that has been long weathered and worn. We learn it is not anchored to the oceanbed but rather a floating raft of sorts that uses propellers to center it constantly above the delicate pipeline bringing oil to the surface. Without propellers, the craft shifts off-centered, risking the pipe bursting and oil flowing freely into the ocean. In a moment of absolute startle, we are with the pilot in the control room when suddenly all power goes out. The silence is matched in terror by the instant knowledge of an oil spill unlike anything they had seen before and the dire need to regain power of the motors.
This is surely an intense film, but it is matched equally with heart, which is an aspect I think many disaster movies gloss over in the end to create a cookie-cutter ending with a bow on top. Here, when the survivors are rescued and brought to safety they are not happy and cheering to be alive. Mike Williams breaks down on his hotel room floor and is unhinged by the horror he had just lived. Families become angry in an attempt to locate their son or daughter on board. Yes this is a true story, and the filmmakers respected the subject enough to give it a bit more weight that a typical blockbuster might have bestowed.
It's hard to rate movies on a scale since it's purely objective and driven by emotion. Deepwater Horizon may not be a perfect movie, and it may have slight flaws, but the feeling of immersion into the story and the characters left me breathless from opening to the final credits. The visual effects add to the story and create images that I won't soon forget. The final moments brought a tear to my eye. From the movies I know are currently playing in theaters, this is the one movie I would want to go back to a second time.""There has been a vast amount of roar about the touching drama ""Lion"", and now I know why it roared with critics. ""Lion"" features the true story of Saroo Brierly, a five-year old Indian boy who gets lost in the streets of an Indian city very far from home. Via events that followed, Saroo gets adopted by an Australian couple John and Sue Brierly. Twenty years later, Saroo decides to come down to Google Earth to help locate his original mother and brother in India. Director Garth Davis provides an authentic emotional landscape that viably transports you into Saroo's incredible story. Luke Davies' screenplay also feeds the ""Lion"" with a genuine verbal touch. Dev Patel was no thespian slumdog with his credible performance as the adult Saroo; Sunny Pawar also provided a little sunshine with his loving performance as the child Saroo. Nicole Kidman's work as Sue Brierly was solid, but not of Oscar caliber; but who am I to believe, I'm just a corny pun kidman. Rooney Mara did not add anything relevant to the picture as Saroo's girlfriend Lucy; so yea, I did not Love the Lucy character here. Nevertheless, I am not lying when I say to feed this cinematic ""Lion"". **** Good""This is one of my favorite Marvel movies so far, if not my favorite. Exceptionally well acted and incredibly well thought out, this film transcends the superhero movie concept.
The action is taut, the digital effects are spectacular, and it's simply one of those films that makes you wish it didn't have to end. Thankfully, there's two ending credit scenes. Benedict Cumberbatch, as far as I'm concerned, was the absolute best choice for the role of Dr. Strange. His top notch acting ability is really what made this movie great. The supporting cast is better than average. It was very well cast.
I feel like I can't - really shouldn't - write any more on this review. It shouldn't be dissected, it should just be enjoyed.""Although I think I would've enjoyed ""A Dog's Purpose"" even more if I'd first read the book (which evidently provides more a little more background information on the characters), my husband (who's very picky) and I really liked this film. I've since ordered the Kindle book! While the film does have a few sad moments, I was very relieved that it wasn't *nearly* as much of a tear jerker as ""Marley & Me"" because this movie ends on a happy note! The moral of the story appears to be that dogs have the ability to contribute so much good to our lives if we let them. As far as the controversy regarding the German Shepherd (""Hercules""), I had not viewed the leaked video until after I saw the movie; however, even if I'd seen the video ahead of time, I don't think I would've boycotted the film. While it was inexcusable for the trainer to attempt to force the dog into the water, it's my understanding that immediately after that rehearsal scene, the dog was moved to the other side of the pool, where he was more comfortable diving right in. Hopefully additional footage will be released to ensure viewers that Hercules was/is okay.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I felt the Assassin's Creed Movie portrayed the games to a very high standard and even some of the slight deviations added more energy and weight to the Assassins Creed story.
The Assassins and Cal's background could have been initially introduced better throughout the start of the movie as it was quite jumpy and rushed in certain areas. However, the balance between the Assassins and the overshadowing Templar Order in the modern day Abstergo facility was undoubtedly incredible.
The descendants of the Assassins (prisoners in Abstergo),having or having obtained the Assassin values initially appearing as a threat to Cal is highly effective in revealing the underlying motif of the story, which is the conflicting ideologies (Assassin's Freedom and Templar's Control) fighting throughout history in a bid to both keep/achieve their goals/morals.
It is never made certain to whom is really doing it right (it does however, lean towards the Assassins though as it does in the games).
Personally, the greatest scene in this movie (and I mean it was so revelational and enthralling) was after Cal had achieved full synchronisation with Agulair (although it never went down like this in the games) and the historic Assassins (and parents) began to surround him as the modern Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was being restored.
This tribute is definitely on par with the story in the Assassin's Creed games which recognises the Brotherhood falling and being restored throughout history with certain iconic historic events and people.""Hacksaw Ridge paints a powerful portrait of the importance of faith and basic respect for one and other, with an emotional and moving tale of a man who refused to lift a gun, making the decision to save lives rather than take them. It is a rough balancing act, but the film remains deeply effective and gripping, as well as violent but dignified at the same time, all of which coalesces into a worthwhile whole. For all its blood, gore, explosions and injury detail, it never forgets the human story it is telling and guarantees that the themes are always front and centre of the picture. Andrew Garfield delivers a career-best performance and Mel Gibson crafts this harrowing and violent tale with enough thought-provoking and moral questioning to ensure you are totally absorbed in this pacifist story. Each and every one of us can find inspiration in this one man's adherence to his true morals and beliefs and in turn will find this true meaning of strength and bravery in the darkest of circumstances.
FULL REVIEW - https://goo.gl/wEiQfV""Well, review scores for this movie is low (yes, low) because a lot of people sees only zombies in it. Yes, zombie part is done pretty well suspenseful and pretty realistic (but not without some assumptions and simplifications) but it is not a point of the movie! I will not tell the main question raised in it, but it is well known to avid reader of classic sci-fi, especially involving aliens ;) And it never hurts to think about it again!
Anyway, it is an excellent, non trivial sci-fi movie raising very very important questions! I was very pleased to watch it and it will stay in my memory for a long time!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After a six-year Harry Potter deficit since the last Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter fans were rewarded with a new addition to the Magical Universe, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, plus its four future installations. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them once again captures and delivers the magical Harry Potter experience. Fans and moviegoers will once feel the captivation of magic as they watch the film, which for American viewers takes place in familiar territory, New York City.
Like the critics, I agree that Fantastic Beasts appealed to my Harry Potter fanaticism. The film has deeper meaning as well, drawing parallels to animal rights, child abuse, social relationships, race relations, and feminism. First, Newt Scamander was one of the few wizards who truly cared for the magical beasts, and he devoted his life to protecting them because he knew that they were being hunted by people such as traders, merchants, and hunters. By writing his popular book, Scamander was able to save the lives of countless creatures because he had brought attention upon them. Similarly, in our society, there are certain groups of people who hunt animals for sport or for superficial benefit. Scamander is an animal-lover, representing today's few animal lovers. In the United States, such immoral practices such as captivating sea animals and forcing them to learn tricks to entertain an audience in Sea World continue, but should be stopped. Animals, like magical beasts, are meant to roam free in the wild, without fear of being killed by menacing, meddling humans. Moving on, child abuse is a subject of concern in the film. Clearly, Credence was extremely troubled, as he was regularly beat by his mother, Mary Lou, for minor actions such as coming home slightly late. He was an obedient child, and protected his sister, so he was abused by his mother, and eventually protected by Tina. Gradually, Credence showed greater signs of internal trouble and eventually manifested into the Obscurus, a dangerous creature. While this was part of the storyline, the problem of child abuse is outlined and demonstrates the problem of child abuse in society, and how it negatively impacts children when they grow up. Next, social relationships are displayed in the movie. Evidently, Newt Scamander was a shy, introverted person. He never looked anyone in the eye, but rather liked to keep to himself and his magical beast-friends. This was an aspect of his appearance I found significant because it accurately portrayed real people in society. Unlike the people in most films, not everyone is wild and extroverted. Having a shy Newt Scamander was appealing in its uniqueness. Next, race relations was exhibited as viewers saw the tensions between No-Majs and wizards. People such as Mary Lou were against witches and wizards, speaking against them. She was likely scared of them and their power. On the other side, wizards were not happy with humans such as Mary-Lou, and some people in the wizardly world even wanted to overpower the No-Majs and rule them. This is similar to society, as race relations can develop tensions as people get scared of another group and generalize group characteristics. This is not moral because people are all different, and cannot be all generalized. Not all magical people are dangerous or evil, for example, and not all people of a certain race are dangerous. Finally, this film relates to feminism with the strong roles of Tina, Queenie, and the head of the Magical Congress. Tina displays the struggle of the modern woman, unable to garner the attention of others, and mistaken as someone who doesn't know what she is doing. However, she helps Newt along with his journey, and becomes an indispensible character of fortitude and strength in the film. Queenie is seen as a confident, daring woman, similar in strength to Tina but in a alluring and feminine way, showing the meaning of feminism with a combination of feminine and feminist. The head of the Magical Congress, Madame President, is also a woman and is the most powerful witch of the government. This high position of power is rare for a woman, especially in the early 1900s time period where the film is set,considering not even today have we not had a a woman president. Finally, the movie had vivid, exciting visuals, finally allowing readers to understand what the beast of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack looks like, and the embarrassing yet endearing mating dance to attract it, by Newt Scamander.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a fast-paced film that brings viewers and fans back into the magical world of Harry Potter, with familiar stars such as Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp. Audiences will find deeper meaning rooted into the story, like all of J.K. Rowling's works, such as societal patterns and issues that continue today. J.K. Rowling has demonstrated an incredibly remarkable talent in her screen writing debut, and will continue to satisfy and thrill viewers for years to come about the magical world, fabricated from her creative mind. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has been nominated for two Oscars at the 89th Academy Awards, Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, and the sequel is set to be released in November 2018.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** . . . because MONSTER TRUCKS is ripped from Today's Headlines, and advises we beleaguered Americans on what to do to get out of our current predicament: fight the Devil's minions with everything that we've got!! Jan. 24 is the date on which America's new Red Commie KGB Czar Vlad ""Mad Dog"" Putin's White House Puppet Rump revived EVERY Environment-Raping, Water-Poisoning Outlawed Pipeline Project ever to make Job-Killing Corrupt Capitalism's Wish List of Horror, and MONSTER TRUCKS is all about such intentional Gang-Banging of Mother Nature and the concurrent Wanton War on Clean Water (Big Bottled Water is a hugely corrupt but profitable scam as well--just ask the People of Flint, MI). The Puppet Rump read verbatim from MONSTER TRUCKS' script Today when he also said that his Rapist Squad is NOT going to forego a penny of Fat Cat One Per Center Profit for the protection of ""things no one has heard of,"" such as the 15,000 new species discovered annually (such as MONSTER TRUCKS' Creeches), as well as snail darters, spotted owls, polar bears, moose, trout, and squirrels.
MONSTER TRUCKS shows the Corrupt Capitalist Goon ""Burke"" character telling an endangered Dakota sheriff that the Law is only for Rich People Party Billionaires shortly before Burke forces the not-fully-cooperative sheriff's vehicle off a cliff. For those of you who may not see enough ""Motivation"" here for the Satanic Behavior of MONSTER TRUCKS' Corporate Villains, let me share with you an incident concerning how the Red Commie KGB bamboozled my neighbor. When I noticed a ""Make America Great Again"" sticker in his window BEFORE the election, I asked him if he was bothered by the well-publicized facts that the self-confessed serial finger rapist behind this slogan had borrowed $10 billion plus from Loan Shark Putin before being forced to ""win"" a ""rigged election"" or get rubbed out by a Ricin-tipped Umbrella, and then he HAD to destroy America the Beautiful until it looked uglier than Chernobyl-ravaged Russia, and next he HAD liquidate the 120 million Americans depending upon ObamaCare, Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, and Medicare so that the U.S. population would shrink to match the dying Russian Breed. My neighbor replied, ""We don't need any retirees, poor people, or cripples, and we can get along without half the women around here, as well!"" If you're part of We 99 Per Cent, and NOT one of the Fat Cat Billionaire Polluters who have usurped power in a Coup D'Etat which will NOT stay ""bloodless"" very long, go see MONSTER TRUCKS for tips on surviving the coming Death Struggle!""It might sound cliché now because the market is being flooded with the character but Deadpool has been my favorite comic character for a while. I've wanted the Merc with the Mouth to get his own big screen movie for years, thinking Ryan Reynolds would be perfect for the role since his performance in BLADE TRINITY as wisecracking Hannibal King. I was excited for Reynolds to assume the role of Wade Wilson in X- MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE and devastated when the character was mutilated by the studio. I'd come to accept the fact that we'd probably never see a true Deadpool cinema incarnation and, lo and behold, Reynolds and crew come through in 2016. DEADPOOL wasn't just a fun, relatively faithful adaptation of my favorite Marvel character but a much needed break from comic book movie routine with the film's proud embracing of the R-rating and utilization of the Deadpool comic tropes we'd come to expect but assumed studios would nix for being ""too weird"" for general audiences. In an effort to reeducate the unknowing masses, DEADPOOL serves as an origin film, explaining to those unfamiliar how Deadpool came to be horribly scarred, certifiably crazy, and essentially immortal. Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a mercenary for hire who, shortly after finding his soul mate in equally damaged working girl Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With limited options, he turns to the mysterious Ajax (Ed Skrein) who claims he can heal Wilson of his disease. And an antihero is born.
DEADPOOL gets a lot of things right and a few things, well, not so much wrong as poorly handled. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I'm psyched at the level of success this little ""comic book movie that couldn't"" has achieved. It was a stroke of luck that the movie ever saw production and the love of audiences to the tune of almost $800 billion in worldwide gross box office all but guarantees we won't have to fight so long to see the continuing adventures. Reynolds is exactly as perfect for the role as we'd all known he would be. He gets the character and truly brings him to life with all the wisecracks, juvenile humor, and bloody violence we'd hoped to see. The costume is fantastic, staying incredibly faithful to the comics and even giving his mask expressive eyes to bring it to life. I also loved the inclusion of T.J. Miller to the cast as Deadpool's buddy Weasel. I've been a fan of Miller for a little while and figured his absurd brand of improvised comedy would be an apt fit in the world of DEADPOOL. The two of them ensure that DEADPOOL is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie, which is exactly as it should be. Deadpool doesn't bring the senses of dread or stoic heroism that comes with the usual X-Men film. In DEADPOOL, our hero puts bullets in brainpans and turns violence into insane performance art.
Deadpool is, of course, a character from the X-Men universe and as a result we get a couple of cameos to establish this. As to which X-Men cinematic universe we're rooted in, it confuses even Deadpool himself (""McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.""), but he's given the chance to fight alongside fan-favorite and criminally-underused Colossus and his current mutant trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). These two act as the straight-edged, voices of reason to Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking craziness in his search for revenge against Ajax. I loved both of them, especially Negasonic. We don't get much out of her character but her angsty teenage persona sets Deadpool up for some fun punchlines and her explosive powers come in handy during the final battle. Colossus is here to give valuable life lessons to Deadpool in hopes of swaying him to the forces of good. I enjoyed the odd-couple pairing of Colossus and Deadpool but I imagine we'll get better banter in the sequel where the end credits coda promises we'll be introduced togo watch for yourself. No spoilers here but it should be obvious to fans. Meanwhile, Colossus serves the role well even if he is comically preachy in his heroic speeches. I love that we finally get an accurate on-screen portrayal (huge, muscular, and Russian) but the CG wasn't always the greatest. It's easily forgiven, and still pretty impressive, considering the limited budget. It makes one hopeful we'll get to see Deadpool's unique brand of crazy interact with other X-Men in future installments.
DEADPOOL isn't without its flaws. The plot is disappointingly simplistic. It's your average origin tale intermixed with a revenge plot, but at least it uses nonlinear storytelling to break it up a bit. Most of the origin element is given through flashbacks over the course of a freeway chase/battle that fills the first hour or so of the movie. Plus everyone beside Deadpool is relegated to two-dimensional characters who only exist to serve a plot purpose. Ajax, Vanessa, Weasel, and especially Ajax's second-in- command Angel Dust (Gina Carano) are pretty thin characters. DEADPOOL is pretty much a one-man show with the Merc with the Mouth taking center-stage and everyone else taking a backseat to his showboating. It's fine though. It's fun. And pretty violent so, you know, leave the kids home for this one. As Deadpool would tell you, he's the best there is at whatever Wolverine does. Wolverine never quite got to cut loose in the X-Men films to the extent Deadpool does here and, superhero or not, this is not a family film. The R-rating should've been a dead giveaway but I'm amazed at how I saw kids at my first screening. In short, DEADPOOL is a comic book movie for people who are tired of comic book movies, while still stumbling into same pitfalls of franchise-opening comic book movies.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** What I like about the movie:
1) Hrithik doesn't disappoint a bit.. 2) Yami Gautam did a superb job too. 3) Ronit Roy (corporator villain) did excellent job as villain. 4) The love between the two blind people is so cute... 5) Rohit Roy is OK.. (the younger brother of the corporator). 5) Girish Kulkarni (dangal fame) did a good job. 6) first 25% of movie is the cute love phase second 25% is the marriage and troubles from the jackals and next 50% is the revenge. 7) The rape scenes ...contrary to my fear...were shot neat and clean; they hint the violence but do not show the vulgarity. 8) The scenes are not too miraculous or larger than life... we can accept that whatever hrithik has done to avenge is possible to be done by someone like him... 9) Wasn't too happy with the second rapist...he doesn't look like someone we should kill...when hrithik kills him, i felt pity for the second rapist ... initially thought he could be uglier or nastier but when I had a second thought... realised..thats how it happens in real world...people who participate in such roles... support roles in crimes are not beasts but get influenced by the evil of the primary culprits.. 10) Movie focuses a few characters and plays around them...
What I don't like about the movie:
1) Everything is decent but to acknowledge he is kaabil, the wife should have been there towards the end. 2) since writer chose to kill Yami, There should have been another character around Hrithik someone close to Yami to acknowledge he is kaabil .... 3) The music I felt is good but didn't highlight the emotional revenge tone. 4) Corporator is killed for supporting his criminal brother...but why are the police spared !!!?
What I would have done if I made it myself: I thought several options but finally conclude what has been done in the movie is perfect... I would only add additional background support to enhance the background music and elevate the emotional scenes... The movie goes in a sequence of events...mostly same sequence as they happened but for a little rewind of events i.e. wife's death first and then the scene of what happened to her before death...or the inspector asking hrithik how he killed the corporator... I would change the editing further and overlap the second half of the movie into the first half ...my movie starts with the murder first...maybe hire the editor from barfi movie... or hire a south Indian specialist editor... or keep the movie as is i.e. 25 25 50 proceedings but keep the first half intact and hire a tamil director for the second half...I get a feeling that revenge scenes are better handled by south and romance by north.
Suggestion to Critics: Please try writing what you would have done to make it better along with criticizing ;-) You will appreciate the merits of the movie...
Suggestion to prospective watchers: Please do watch... you will love it... for me, I loved the movie...happy how the first half is made but only felt wanting for little more about the second half ...
Its like I need 2 large pegs of quality whiskey for a pleasant kick...and I only have 1 and half peg in my bottle before i emptied it in the middle of the night..""I have watched many movies and read many amazing stories of people who have battled and overcome personal situations in their lives, many of these stories i have been touched by them being told, but this story was so beautifully told, from the moment the movie started it took me through the eyes of this child how he lived and walked through life, the struggles he had to overcome to survive which shows how much we take for granted. I felt, as i watched it there was so much realism in it with out any Hollywood b.s. to boost the story, it felt raw, real and equally beautiful and sad at the same time. What an amazing journey this young man has travelled. God bless to him and his family.""I'll start off by saying that I am not the biggest musical fan and as such I went into this movie with a certain amount of trepidation, hoping that the Gosling-Stone combination that we've all enjoyed before would be enough to change my opinion on the genre. I'm happy to say that to a certain extent it did!
I have to admit, the all singing all dancing, over-the-top opening scene did little in the way of settling my initial concerns, but from that point on the film was a delight. Light hearted with two excellent protagonists; on one side you have Sebastian, an aspiring jazz musician looking to revive the romance of ""old style jazz"" while the rest of the music scene moves on. On the other there's Mia, a stereotypical wannabe actress who spends her days as a barista in a LA coffee shop between the hundreds of auditions that she hopes will one day see her ""discovered"".
It's the age-old story of two young, ambitious individuals who are surely bound by fate to end up together, each with their own happy endings? But aside from the basic premise, nothing about this film is typical. The chemistry seen between Gosling and Stone is one that has rarely been seen in recent Hollywood movies; both play off of each other perfectly and if you didn't know better you would truly believe that the two were in fact in a real life relationship.
But despite these two exceptional pieces of acting (which will surely land one of the two an Oscar), the real praise has to land firmly on the shoulders of director, Damien Chazelle, for the way he assembled this movie. For many the prospect of a two hour long musical is the stuff of nightmares, 120 minutes of singing, dancing and jazz hands. But this is a musical like no other that I've seen; each song serves as the perfect accompaniment to the exceptionally written script; each lyric bares significance and the style and the understated manner in which it is all combined works perfectly. It's for this reason that the excellent as they may be performances of Gosling and Stone are left in someways out shined by their director.
A true triumph of musical film that is sure to go down as one of the great pieces of work of our time. Not least because it actually got a musical cynic like me to truly appreciate the genre and even consider a second run-through in as many weeks!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** My most anticipated movie of the year Came out i was so excited about it I liked and bought it the ultimate edition,now lets speak about it,finally i saw batman like Ben Affleck respecting comic book he was like F***king people and thats batman in comics so affleck is the best batman and bruce wayne but still the dark knight trilogy is way better ,zack snyder one of my favourite Directors of all time he directed great directing jesse eisenberg was good as lex luthor JR he was like the riddler and joker of heath ledger and himself mixed together,dialogue was good but could been better in some scenes like the part of Martha there were millions of reasons to stop the fight for and the part of Lex was giving a man a candy i was like WTF,wonder woman was the best thing in my opinion but i enjoyed i would give it 8.5/10""Wow! So far the Oscar movies are absolutely terrific and ARRIVAL is just as so. It deals with one of the most run-of-the-mill situations that has been portrayed several times in Hollywood-'The Arrival of extra terrestrials on earth.' However this approach is like nothing we've seen before. It is above the typical idea of extinction of the human race. It has a much more radical perspective (when I say this, I refer to the way they dealt with the situation, it was very human like)
Each and every aspect of the movie is perfect right from the story to the acting. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner were brilliant as the leads. All the scenes were directed with a purpose that is easily understood. In each clip the audience is able to feel exactly what the director wanted to show. You are able to relate to the character's emotions and actions.
As for the story we see that more than it just being scientific, a philosophical outlook is also shown. The soundtrack is a great asset of the movie. It amplifies the feels of each situation for the audience. Especially in the ending, surely it'll stay in your head a while.
This movie is a must see. Everything you could possibly expect from it, it delivers on and does much more than that.
SPOILERS: The only questionable scene of the movie was the part where they show Louise teaching the language of the aliens to a class. Now imagine a world where everyone knew the future, that would be madness. Certainly someone would want to change what they see, and that could only lead to chaos.""Well I think this is a superb film. There is great economy with the script and the directing but a great deal is communicated about why we humans are so often behave in ways that are disappointing.
The main character, played by three actors as he ages, is a man of little words but rather wonderfully he does say exactly what needs to be said at a couple of key moments.
There isn't really a clear good and bad in the film, the bad characters are so because they are frightened people and his is so true of life. The film communicates this so much better than I have.
The directing is for the most part really exceptional. We move through the story in such an efficient and elegant way. Actually the directing is really rather stylish, but it stays out of the way of the story telling so you don't really notice it.
From some of the reviews you might think that the film is depressing, but it is not. This is essentially an optimistic film as I think you'll find.""A man lives with his six children, age from 8 to around 18, in the woods, where he trains them as some utopian superhumans. But all goes sideways when the mother of the children and the man's wife kills herself...
Do we like the world we live in? Do we wanna change it to the better, or there's no other way but to bend down and adapt? Well, Captain Fantastic is a story about people who had no illusions about the modern society surrounding them, so instead of letting it crook their lives and the lives of their children they decided to create their own small paradise, the triumphant kingdom of both physical and mental superiority. But it would be too simplistic to paint the story in just black and white, so to make our superkids a little more human the filmmakers gave them a flaw of being absolutely incapacitated socially. The whole movie then progresses by using that striking contrast as its driver until, eventually, it settles things to a seemingly reasonable consensus between the perfect ideas and the imperfect world those ideas have to be implemented in.
...
There's a moment in this film when Viggo Mortensen's character asks his daughter to give her analysis of Nabokov's Lolita. She at first struggles to find the right words, saying ""it's interesting"". ""Be more specific"", he replies, because he tries to teach his kids to do more than just scratching the surface and being satisfied with simple answers.
Well, finding the right words for this film might be an equally challenging task. And it's definitely a mixed bag of emotions and impressions. I like and admire the film for how beautifully it's made. The chemistry between the kids, more bound to each other now that they have nobody else to turn to, and their father, who's both an upholding pillar of their lives and a subject of their angst and frustration, is a never-ending source of wonder. Now that Viggo Mortensen's gradually ending his career as an action figure, seeing him go for the emotional complexity - and succeed at it - is quite a pleasure.
What I don't find the pleasure in, however, is a typical loophole of giving the otherwise flawless characters a defect both huge and unlikely, using that trick to create something resembling a conflict the movie would be so desperately lacking otherwise. Why do children who can master quantum physics or military-grade physical training have to be so blatantly ignorant when it comes to the regular people's lives? Why would a kid know about the Supreme Court cases but have no idea what Nike or Coca Cola is? Why would a guy be speaking six languages but have no idea how to talk to a girl? It's not like the only books in this world are for nerds, we have social studies and psychological literature as well. Of course, if Ben's kids were reading those books too they would be Hanna-like complete (for those unaware who I refer to, please watch the 2011 film of the same name, it's really awesome in its own right). But that kind of perfection assumes a sense of purpose, something that we regular flawed people are entitled not to have or to struggle searching for, and something that turns a perfect human into something not entirely human but rather like a tool or a weapon. And the thing Ben's kids definitely don't have is a knowledge of what to do with such fantastically special selves.
Maybe I'm over-analyzing and it's just my wishful thinking, but it really seems that behind the story of Captain Fantastic is a story of us all and the question we all seek the answer for: what is happiness and what's the way to achieve it? It's clear that the ""superkids"" in this film are superior to the most of us in terms of mental and physical development. But what's the point of all that potency? Does it make them happy? Do they feel better than the regular typical us simply because they are healthier, stronger or more educated? Or do they feel lonely and cast away from the society which finds unity in its common flaws and mistakes? Because those fat/lazy/shortsighted and basically ignorant people don't seem to suffer too much from their imperfections. Maybe they don't even realize their existence. Ignorance may be a real bliss sometimes.
The only problem is that once you've gotten yourself above that bliss and saw the ugliness it grows from, no matter how much you try to go back you won't be able to get it back, you've come undone already. So the seemingly blissful finale of the film's story is nothing more than just a question: you have traded in your consistency, but have you gotten what you wanted, have you become happy for real? And come think of it, ignorance might not only be a source of bliss but the very single chance to achieve it...""*** This review may contain spoilers *** 'The Accountant' is not just about someone who does people's taxes and saves people money? It's so much more than that with Gavin O'Connor's (Miracle, Warrior) film 'The Accountant', starring Ben Affleck or as we all know him now as 'Batman'. 'The Accountant' is a mix between Jason Bourne, Rain Man, and John Wick as we follow a man named Christian Wolff (if that's his real name?) who was diagnosed as a high-functioning autistic kid at a young age. He had an affinity for numbers and solving puzzles, and was super quick to do so. He might have just been a superhero from an early age.
His father raised him to harness his abilities in unorthodox ways, such as teaching the young ""accountant"" kung-fu skills and how to shoot a number of guns. Instead of running off to Las Vegas to count cards, this kid grew up into Ben Affleck and is a legit account, but for a ton of drug cartels and super criminals around the world. No, he's not a bad guy, as he has a heart of gold, and will take out the bad guys one by one if they try and come after him with great ease.
That's where we enter our story where John Lithgow hires Ben Affleck to look at the books for his robotic company and all hell breaks loose when people start ending up dead. Meanwhile, J.K. Simmons who works for the CIA wants to know who this ""accountant"" is and why he's hanging out with another timid accountant (Anna Kendrick). Bullets fly by at an incredible rate throughout the film and there is some excellent fight choreography that will make yo believe Ben Affleck is indeed that BADASS! I mean, there are certain scenes in this film where Affleck should have just worn the cape and cowl and been called Batman.
On the other side, Affleck's character is awkward, shy, and monotone, but you can tell that the character desperately wants to fit in and be normal, which Affleck shows on screen in every scene. There are a ton of genuine and even funny moments with him and his ticks and it all plays out great. J.K. Simmons does a hell of a job here as someone who has a haunted past, as Anna Kendrick, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Lithgow all turn in excellent performances.
The film as a whole is fairly predictable, even though Gavin O'Connor tries to pull the sheets over our eyes, but if you were paying any sort of attention at the start of the film, you could tell where 'The Accountant' was going to tally up the sum (apologies). For a two hour action film, the stories, performance, and script all have a bit of depth and charm to put it above the rest and should really give the 'Bourne' franchise a run for its money. Come on, it's what we've always wanted. Affleck vs Damon in a steel cage match somewhere in Rome. Think of the possibilities.
RECOMMENDED!""this is a 70's B/ grindhouse movie throwback in the best way possible. Manu Bennett is awesome as always, Perfectus was the perfect foil, Malcolm McDowell was hamming it up as only he can, and it was just genuinely a ton of fun. they went old school for the special effects,and it works for the tone of the movie. face on shots into the cars in front of obvious green screen, body parts that are obviously fake, tiny skips between vehicles crashing and then exploding. these techniques were done in just the right way to bring back the nostalgia feels if you grew up on classing cheesy cult movies. the storyline isn't a carbon copy of Death Race 2000, and throws in a few nice swerves. the social commentary is still there. seeing some of the new names for areas in America was a running joke that kept getting funnier the further West the races went. from the intentionally dated special effects,to the biting political satire, this is a worthy successor to the classic cult movie.""I watched this movie without any expectations and it was worth every second of it. Great movie, just great. From the first scene to the last i was hooked.
The characters were interesting and the plot was very creative. This might be the best movie i have seen in a while that is considered as action. The theme in the air was not obvious and it took a while to really understand that the biggest thing in this movie is family. Even that there was a lot of other things happening.
Acting was phenomenal. J.K. Simmons once again left me speechless and i have to give a lot of credit to Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthall who had an amazing scene at this movie.
The action scenes were great. They reminded me a lot of John Wick. Which is great, because that was a good movie. The characters had depth, the plot was great and there were some very good twists. And what makes it even better is that they were really surprising.
Easily the best movie of 2016 so far.""From the late 1940s through the 1950s, town theaters across mid-America at least, had Saturday matinée shows for kids. We had a second theater in my hometown that always showed Westerns  usually double features. Before TV became widespread, that's how kids saw many of the older Westerns and other films. And, that's where I saw my earliest Zorro movies. By the time the Zorro TV series was on the air, 1957-59, I was in high school, but I still watched it once in a while with my younger brothers. We were all wrapped up in Zorro, The Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy.
The modern recreations of those old Westerns have much more glamour and glitz along with the color. I wonder if kids today see the stories and heroes quite the same way as kids did of a couple generations ago. Still, those of us who grew up with the originals can enjoy the modern takes and different stars in the roles.
This 1998 reprisal of the ""Robin Hood"" of Old California, has some different twists. But, it is a good action follow-up to the 1940 film, ""The Mark of Zorro."" Although a couple of silent films, and one other talking picture had been made before, the 1940 film entrenched the masked caballero as a Western hero on film. Tyrone Power starred as Don Diego de la Vaga. Zorro had been highly popular in serialized articles and then books by Johnston McCulley since 1919. Now he was assured of longevity for future generations of kids, young and old.
Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are very good in their lead roles. Anthony Hopkins is very good in his role, which is a twist on the original stories. With its swashbuckling action, ""The Mask of Zorro"" and is a good modern tale of the fox of early California days.""""Event Horizon"" is one of those films that came out at just the right time, even if it didn't seem like it at first. The brainchild of director Paul WS Anderson and writer Philip Eisner, the movie is a certified cult phenomena. Despite being a moderate financial flop at initial release and garnering decided mixed critical reception, the film quickly found a new life in the home video and rental market, and even now, 20 years later, it remains a favorite for fans of horror and suspense. It became one of the most popular films of the 90's in a weird way thanks to its second life, and I do think it is for good reason- while by no means is ""Event Horizon"" a ""great"" film, it is most certainly great fun. Mildly creepy, well constructed and oftentimes disturbing, it's a very solid sci-fi scare fest.
About thirty years in the future, the space-vessel ""Event Horizon"" mysteriously reappears off the orbit of Neptune, after having been thought to be long-since lost. A rescue vessel- the Lewis and Clark- is sent on a mission to track down the fabled ship and see if there are any survivors. On board is a colorful cast of characters, including the Event Horizon's lead designer Dr. William Weir. But it turns out that not all is well- the ship seems to desolate... its crew dead and its mysterious gravity-drive core acting strangely. It soon becomes clear that when its experimental warp drive was activated, the ship crossed into a dark and hellish dimension that drove its crew insane and brought back a mysterious force that now threatens to destroy the Lewis and Clark and its crew. And so the crew of Weir, Captain Miller, Lieutenant Starck and several others are forced into a fight for survival against this mysterious presence...
One of the more remarkable things about the film is the sheer Gothic and claustrophobic style that director Anderson injects into each and every frame, and how well it helps to tell the tale with a devilish glee. While he's perhaps best known now as the director of the long-running and wildly divisive ""Resident Evil"" film franchise, Anderson has always been a relatively competent visual storyteller and he has a great eye for style and composition. Building off of the tension and tonality of Eisner's script (which was reportedly re-written by an uncredited Andrew Kevin Walker), Anderson builds an adequate and often frightening sense of mood and tension, and his keen use of both practical and digital effects comes much appreciated.
The performances of the cast are quite good, especially for being a relatively serious attempt at a genre film at a time when horror was taking a turn towards the humorous thanks to properties like ""Scream"" injecting a subversive sense of self-awareness. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil in particular excel as our two leads in Captain Miller and Dr. Weir. Fishburne plays a really good authoritative figure in Miller, though he plays it smart and gives small hints of pathos and self- doubt that become apparent more and more as the film moves along, and it gives what could otherwise have been a boring Mary-Sue character a great deal more depth as a result. Neil is just a blast as Dr. Weir, who is haunted by his own demons of the past and goes through some radical changes as the film goes on. Supporting roles by the likes of Jason Isaacs, Joely Richardson and Richard T. Jones are for the most part well-played, though I did find Jones a bit on-the-nose with his more stereotypical role as the ""comedic relief.""
Really, the only thing the film suffers for are a few contrived sequences that feel artificial and over-written and for some admittedly dated sequences that just don't hold up quite well. While I do applaud Anderson for mostly mixing his effects between practical and digital, the early half of the film is way too over- reliant on really bad-looking CGI, and it kind of takes you out of the scene for a moment whenever a digital bottle or digital book floats by in zero-gravity. There's also a bit too much effort put into just grossing out the audience or making them jump, and it cheapens the more legitimate sequences of terror. Yes, we know it's fun to toss gore at the screen and insert random jump-scares... but save it for the slasher films and not pictures like this that are genuinely and consistently well-made and frightening without goo and gore and jumps. There's also one really bad dream sequence early on that I won't spoil... but it almost ruins the mood right off the bat. Thankfully, the film quickly recovers and it gets better very quickly, but I definitely think the film could have done without it.
But those are really just minor issues in an otherwise fun, engaging and often freakish and frightening tale of terror. There's a reason ""Event Horizon"" eventually found its audience and is still a relatively popular and entertaining bit of sci-fi horror... and that's because it's just so much fun. It's got an intriguing enough plot, wonderful direction and freakish visuals that will stick with your mind, and a really great cast that give it their all. Is it one of the best films of the 90's? No. But I'd venture to say it's one of the most easily rewatchable and fun releases of its decade and I know for sure that even twenty years from now, people will still get a kick out of it.
I give ""Event Horizon"" a very good 8 out of 10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie is as realistic as it can get, and i'm not talking about creatures, places that the main protagonists created out of their pure imagination, i'm talking about plot development. Movies like this one usually make you wonder about the harsh reality that things can be very accidental in life. Meeting a new person (Leslie) that shares with you many traits and becomes your best (maybe only friend) is really a long and hard-to-accept process, especially to young boys (Jess) or girls who have to struggle with life at school, home. Yet when the two becomes really close friends to each other (Jess finally accepts Leslie into his life), reality strikes out of nowhere. That part would make you cry and the part later shows you how he would cope with that lifetime incident and go on. It's beautiful because it displays how much friendship can hold if it's a true one. To people like myself (who enjoy movies for its plot despite anything else), you'll love and learn a lot from this amazing movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Thirteen years ago Pixar released the mega-successful Finding Nemo starring two clownfish, Marlin and Nemo, with their buddy, a regal blue tang fish named Dory. Albert Brooks is back as Marlin and Ellen Degeneres again plays Dory, saddled throughout with short-term memory loss. Finding Dory amounts to a spin off of Finding Nemo, with Dory now playing the lead and Marlin and Nemo doing the honors as gracious sidekicks.
Perhaps the most problematic aspect of the Finding Dory narrative is the Act One machinations. The inciting incident involves Dory's separation from her parents who are part of an open ocean exhibit at a rehabilitative Marine Institute in California; after she's caught in an undertow Dory finds herself on the other side of the Pacific and is reunited with Marlin and Nemo.
Dory, with her short term memory loss, represents an opportunity not only to exploit comic possibilities but also to make an important point that parents who have children with developmental disabilities should never give up on them and continue to encourage whatever latent abilities to improve themselves, they might possess.
Dory's parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy) are the prototypical nurturers who make periodic appearances in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. Despite all the approbation, Dory still suffers from lack of self-esteem, and it's only through her journey of self-discovery that she overcomes her self-deprecating self-absorption.
The scenarists perhaps at this juncture have made the mistake of explicating Dory's predicament ad infinitum, resulting in a lugubrious Act One, featuring much too much talk and little action. There's a nice little scene of a stingray migration, Dory, Marlin and Nemo hitching a ride on the back of a sea turtle taking them to California and perhaps the only scary moment for young children an encounter with a menacing squid who puts a nice little scare into our determined protagonists.
Surprisingly, it's the voice of Sigourney Weaver playing herself that signals the break into an exciting and much more gripping Act Twohere Weaver is the voice of the Marine Institute, where our fish heroes interact with a coterie of human characters devoted to creating obstacles which prevent Dory from both finding her parents and ultimately saving her best buddies, Marlin and Nemo.
When Dory is inadvertently twisted up in a six-pack ring, she's scooped up by staff members from the Marine Institute and tagged and sent to the quarantine section. There she's aided by the seven-legged octopus, Hank, who oddly derides ocean life and would prefer to live out the rest of his days in quarantine (in Cleveland of all places)all Hank wants is Dory's tag and he agrees first to help her find her parents.
Dory ultimately learns that her fellow regal blue tangs are all in quarantine and probably hold the secret as to the fate of her parents. Along the way at one of the exhibits, Dory meets her childhood friend Destiny, a benign, near-sighted whale shark, and her companion, Bailey, a beluga whale who's been attempting to recover his powers of Echolocation after a purported head injury. Note that the two whales are as goofy as Dory and are another example of the intentionally designed non- threatening marine life, guaranteed not to scare away younger viewers.
Both Dory as well as Marlin and Nemo take circuitous routes to arrive back in quarantine. Hank, operating a runaway stroller with his tentacles through the Institute, is guided by Dory, who gives directions while ensconced in a fishbowl. They end up in the enormously clever children's ""Touch Pool,"" where they both are almost scooped up by ""possessed"" children, desperate for contact with the sedentary marine life in the pool beneath. Only Hank's sudden release of black ink flooding the pool, saves our protagonists from not accomplishing their ultimate objectives.
Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo have their set of allies who aid them in their quest to find Dory. The hilarious sea lions Fluke and Rudder end up summoning the disfigured loon, Becky, and are aided by the nerdy Gerald, who provides the pail for Becky to transport Marlin and Nemo into the innermost cave of the Institute. Once inside, Marlin and Nemo propel themselves out of a tank by hopping over columns of jet sprays. Once Dory, Marlin and Nemo are reunited, Dory faces the ""dark moment"" at the end of ACT 2where she incorrectly comes to believe that her parents have diedafter her encounter with her fellow regal blue tangs. Fortunately, the dire belief is short- lived, once Dory finds the shells her parents have left for hernow she has a joyous reunion with her parents who reveal they've waited for her this whole time. Note here Dory loses her self-pity and becomes self- actualizednow she must save Marlin and Nemo who are still stuck in the truck headed for Cleveland that has just left the Institute.
Despite their absurdity (and perhaps that's what makes it so enjoyable), the Act 3 machinations are very satisfying. How does Dory get the truck to stop so he and Hank can take command of it? Just have a bunch of very cute otters crawl up the side of the bridge, crawl out onto the highway, and stop traffic. How does the truck, pointed in the wrong direction, get back to the Institute? Just have Hank grab control of the steering wheel with Dory again providing directions, ensconced inside a fish bowl this time on the truck's dashboard! And finally dig the slow motion scene where the truck crashes through the railings, the back door flings open and all the fish fall back into the ocean.
Despite its slow start, Finding Dory morphs into an adorable animated action film for both adults and children. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks manage to finely provide the obligatory comic relief as well as important encouragement for parents and children who are dealing with the spectre of childhood developmental disabilities.""I am absolutely blown away.
Not only is this bizarre indie film about a farting corpse and a lonely, suicidal man stranded on an island one of the funniest films of last year, but it is also one of the most emotionally moving. A movie about a farting corpse is moving? I guess so.
The fact that the directors managed to make this film work splendidly despite it having such an off the walls plot is highly impressive, but the fact that they also managed to make it a beautiful and thought provoking piece of art is an even greatest achievement. Sure, there's jokes about farts and boners and masturbating throughout, but there's also meaningful commentary on life and love-and it is all complicated by a fantastic soundtrack (made up almost entirely of human voices) and excellent performances by Paul Dano and especially Daniel Radcliffe, who turns his role a weird corpse into one of the most memorable, hilarious, and likable movie characters I've seen in a long time.
After having experienced this film, I'm almost at a loss for words. It's really just a movie I'd recommend any readers to watch on their own, because there's no point in me just describing the film's memorable events and dialogue-one should really just see it for themselves. It's a brilliant film that deserves much more praise than it has gotten. I was not expecting any Best Picture nominees to be given to such a weird movie, but I cannot get over the fact that the Oscars just flat out ignored the movie in terms of original score, screenplay, and performances.
Seriously, this is a brilliant, underrated, surreal, laugh out loud funny, and emotionally overwhelming masterpiece that must be seen by those who can embrace the weirdness.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After reading all those bad reviews , I decided to write my own review. The movie was excellent. It was really fun to watch, it made me laugh. It was the best spy comedy I have ever watched. The movie had a plot,it moved on fast, Melissa MC carthy was acting as she should. Nothing like her awful acting in the Heat. Jason Statham was really good at his role as a disastrous spy. I also liked the fact that the movie switched places fast, traveling through the beauty of European cities. it was very enjoyable. The reason I give 9/10 and not 10/10 , were 2 gruesome killings which could have been avoided. I mean ,they could have died without so much splatter. That would make the movie suitable for younger audience. But in general , the movie has an interesting plot, a great cast, a beautiful cinematography, I totally recommend it.""what a interesting movie i ever i watched and i just don't know how my one and half hour just spend really very very interesting movie and also most complicated time travel movie too well first there is lady who is telling her story too a man her story is a way to interesting and the man who's she is telling he is a govt. secret employee and he have a time traveling machine that's like a sniper cage type something you just have to put the year on that thing and boom you just become on that time i just don't understand the time things happen to here that is impossible even time traveling is impossible for now but i will explain the man who's telling the story to the secret employee actually he is not man he is woman in past but due to some disease doctor change her gender woman to man so when he told all story to that secret employee man he take him to past and he who were girl in past meet herself and have sex with her and there is a baby born and the secret employee take that baby girl and put her in more past so overall the baby and the teenager girl and the man are same how it's that possible it's like he had sex to made herself i watched many time traveling related movie like hot tube time machine, project almanac , source code , looper etc. but this one is a way complicated and also this one is a way too interesting then any of those i mention i just loved this one IMDb 7.5""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Looking at the obit page on IMDb's Classic Film board,I was sad to see that Evil Dead 2 co-star John Peakes had died over the weekend. Talking to a fellow IMDb a few days ago about watching the movie for the first time,I decided to pay a tribute viewing to Peakes.
The plot:
In the cabin with his girlfriend Linda,Ash finds a tape recorder. Playing the tape,Ash finds that it is a recording of Professor Raymond Knowby reading from The Book of the Dead,that awakes an evil curse. Stopping the demon from taking him over,Ash chops his girlfriend Linda's head off for the second time (!),whilst finding that the exit from the woods is closed. Trying find their own way out,Knowby's daughter Annie,fellow researcher Ed Getley and guides Jake and Bobby Joe open the cabin door to find Ash taking on the evil dead.
View on the film:
Setting the mood for the flick, John Peakes gives a charming performance as Knowby,whose eerie voice in the opening whips up a Gothic chill. Picking up the chainsaw again, Bruce Campbell beams with a real growth in confidence as Ash,via Campbell hitting the quirky Comedy shotguns with a demonic glee,and taking down the living evil dead with brash one-liners.
Kicking the cabin doors open,the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Scott Spiegel) director Sam Raimi leaves no waste on the bone,with the 20 minute set-up of the first film being replaced by a rolling 5 minute intro. Not needing to set anything up,the writers tear the horror jugular with outrageous slap-stick and cackling demons. Playing fast and loose with the plot,the writers grip all of the horror chills and comedy spills on Ash's grisly fight or flight survival instinct.
Finding themselves with some decent cash for the first time in the series,director Sam Raimi & cinematographer Peter Deming masterfully mash gooey Horror,vicious slap-stick Comedy and quirky stop-motion Fantasy animation for a deadly delight. Splashing the screen in green and red ooze burning in lighting fast tracking shots circling the cabin,Raimi unexpectedly dips into Horror surrealism. Hitting Ash with buckets of demon blood,Raimi uses the surrealism to stop the flick becoming overly serious,via darkly hilariously bonkers set- pieces where Ash chainsaws a demonic head and fights against his own hand!,with Ash finding himself facing the evil dead for the second time.""In 1965, the coach of the high school girl basketball team Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is invited by the Texas Western Miners to be their coach. Despite the lack of budget, Haskins sees the chance to dispute the NCAA and moves with his wife and children to the college dormitory. He recruits seven talented and rejected black players to play with five Caucasian players and formed a legendary team that wined the 1966 national championship against the powerful Kentucky.
""Glory Road"" is an engaging film with a great message based on a true story. In a period when the racism was explicit in the USA, Don Haskins challenged many people with his team of black players implementing discipline and training and winning the NCAA against all the odds. The film shows the difficulties and prejudice the players were submitted and how they superseded all the relationship problems proving that they were equal to (or even better than) the white players. My vote is eight.
Title (Brazil): ""Estrada para a Glória"" (""Road to the Glory"")""The idea is great and the acting was really good, but there are many errors, in my opinion, in the early parts of the film.I mean,you can't really believe that the only people thinking rationally will be the two main characters,and the constant need to explain everything that comes to mind is really dull.Every military person is in constant need of blowing something up, doesn't respond to common decency and is being really conservative about any of the ideas that are peaceful and not war-related. Than there's the problem of communication with the rest of the world,but that might not be too far from reality (its a dumb world we live in).It's kinda childish in my opinion.The ending is something special.On one hand,it's really powerful and interesting (it gave me the chills), but on the other,it's too unrealistic and that magical moment where Louise gets the knowledge from the alien really doesn't cut it for me,since it's a plausible situation in the future (until that moment) and a big problem if it does actually happen. Overall,even with some errors and a bunch of clichés, Arrival really got my attention and the acting of Amy Adams(at least should have got a nomination),as well as the plot,is really something special.""A marvelous, multidimensional film that, through expert toying of light and darkness, subtle visual cues and superb acting, slowly peels its layers to reveal different outlooks of the same, immovable focal point  freedom.
The movie is equally about postmodern intellectual brilliance as it is about primordial love; about the importance of safeguarding boundaries as much as the human drive to question them, push and, utterly, shatter them to pieces.
I saw myself in Caleb's virginal naivety, in Nathan's stylized instability, in Kyoko's muted despair and, the triumph of the movie, Ava's basal want.
Manufactured or not, when the human can come to identify with the artificial, that can only be classed as grandiose cinematic success.""One day, two men are traveling by train. Guy Haines (Farley Granger) is a young tennis star and Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) is a socialite. A very *disturbed* socialite. Bruno stubbornly tries to get Guy to agree to an ""arrangement"". Both men have people in their lives whom they could easily do without. With Guy, it's his promiscuous, mercurial wife Miriam (Kasey Rogers). With Bruno, it's his domineering father (Jonathan Hale). So what Bruno proposes is simple: he will murder Miriam while Guy while murder Mr. Antony. Guy, being a basically decent person, will have none of this, but finds it exceedingly difficult to extract this persistent creep from his life.
Alfred Hitchcock works wonders with the ingenious source material, Patricia Highsmiths' novel, which was adapted by Whitfield Cook and scripted by Raymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde. His mastery of film is evident with some really neat visual tricks, and of course his handling of key suspense sequences. There's one in the Antony family mansion, and a major set piece four fifths of the way through as Hitch cuts between strenuous efforts to retrieve a lighter and Guy's fevered attempts to win as many games as quickly as possible. The finale is also incredibly exciting and memorable, as it takes place on an out of control merry-go- round. Absolutely no time is wasted, as Guy and Bruno meet within the films' opening minutes and it doesn't take Bruno long to propose his scheme to the understandably miffed younger man.
The cast is very good all the way down the line. Granger is a typically personable lead, and there's fine support by Ruth Roman as a loyal girlfriend, Leo G. Carroll as her senator father, Hitchs' daughter Patricia as her perky younger sister, the amusing Marion Lorne as Brunos' doting mother, John Brown as a drunken ""witness"", and Howard St. John, Robert Gist, and John Doucette as various cops. The sadly short lived Walker easily dominates the story, though, and he does a *superb* job. Keep your eyes pealed for the standard Hitch cameo about ten and a half minutes into the film.
Top notch filmmaking and storytelling; this is truly one of the all time great Hollywood thrillers. The premise was later exploited for comedic value in ""Throw Momma from the Train"".
10 out of 10.""I don't know how many times I've watched this movie. We didn't have cable at this time and all we had was a DVR. Each time I noticed something new in the film. The characters were well thought out and the actors stayed within their creation's limits. Quite believable and lovable. My family and I found the movie to keep us engaged from start to finish and still keeps us engaged when we discuss those lean years financially. Forest, you are all we had! The southern setting was perfect for the movie and the cinematography didn't skimp on giving us an eyeful of how people live down there. Love the south. The interaction between Forest and the events through the time line were well interlaced and seemed to explain when some of those events were the way they were. A great Saturday night movie.""There have been numerous stereotypical, repetitive and gruesome zombie movies since the beginning of the millennium and now South Korea has officially jumped on the bandwagon... and revolutionized the entire genre with the very best movie of its kind.
""Train to Busan"" convinces on every single level. The settings are diversified and very well chosen and the gripping atmosphere is pushed forward by the idea of a few random passengers being caught on a train with a horde of zombies. The cinematography is perfectly balanced between intense close-ups and larger angles. There are almost no shaky camera passages as opposed to the disappointing contemporary Hollywood standard. The story finds the right path between brutal intensity and great acting skills. The film is never slowing down and highly intriguing from the very first until the very last scene.
What really makes this zombie movie stand out even compared to the better genre flicks is the depth and diversity of the intriguing characters that are perfectly portrayed by skilled actresses and actors. We get to meet a busy and divorced hedge fund manager and his estranged daughter who is desperately trying to get his attention. We follow the actions of a tough, honest and brave working-class man and his more serious pregnant wife. We are introduced to two old sisters with an intense connection who are inseparable. We meet a naive cheerleader and the baseball player she has a crush on and witness how they mature and become adults within just a few hours. The movie also has a strong antagonist in form of a pitiless chief executive officer who will do anything to survive. I have rarely watched a movie with so many addicting, authentic and profound characters. A special shout- out goes to child actress Kim Su-an who is more convincing in her role in this single film than many ambitious adult actresses in Hollywood in their entire careers.
One has to be aware of the fact that this isn't a Hollywood movie. This movie doesn't try to be politically correct by adding a character of each possible visible minority in the world to the cast but we get a refreshingly realistic portrait of South Korean citizens fighting for survival instead. The film doesn't have a deeper philosophical meaning or tries to explain the zombie outbreak in melancholic images and words because this movie simply focuses on the dangerous situation where the characters don't have any time to over-analyze the situation. The sympathetic heroes of the story won't necessarily survive at the end of the movie and the last half hour includes several shocking and heartbreaking moments that will get you emotionally involved without being pathetic.
In the end, there isn't anything negative to say about this movie that mixes horror, drama and action elements to what might be the best zombie movie of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed out on one of the greatest movies of the past few years. Along with the stunning South Korean horror film ""The Wailing"", the epic ""Train to Busan'' is the best film of the year 2016.""I haven't read the book.
I gave this film the perfect score of 10 to balance a little from all the bad ratings it received from people who were expecting a masterpiece and copycat story from the book.
From a cinematic point of view,I found that the acting was great from Will Smith as usual, the few other characters were also good.
The story is well written, with flashbacks here and there to make us understand how the situation got to where it is. From a purely cinematic point of view, this this deserves way more than a 7.2/10.
I understand if people who've read the book are disappointed with it, but guess what, 90% if not more, of the movies based on books won't be as good the books, because:
-when you read it, you make your own imagination and perceive characters, situations, and everything else differently than how it would look in the film. -it is impossible to add the same amount of detail as in the books, or else it will last 5h
There are only a handful of movies based on books that are considered better than the books themselves. Even the most recognized movies/series based on books, that try to follow as closely as possible the stories as originally written (ie Lord of the rings, harry potter, GoT...) still differ and lack important(?) details.""No praise can make this film justice. No compliment can compliment it enough. This is not only a classic film but the best western film ever made.
From the excellent actors to the epic music and plot this movie is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. Clint Eastwood definitely gives one of the best performances in his career. It doesn't matter what kind of movies you like , you have to watch it because while watching it you witness greatness , quality and top notch filmography. I don't think there are many people who would not stand and watch in awe , since this masterpiece of a film delivers and goes the western film genre to another level. Ennio Morricone also composes the best ost in his career and that's saying a lot. There is violence,there is brilliance,there is everything you need to categorize a film as a landmark of the times it was created.""But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.
Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for sure""Videodrome was made more than three decades ago and dispute the setting of cable TV being nowadays outdated ,the idea it isn't. Far from it, it actually quit prophetic about the evolution of mass entertainment.
In the story we follow a sleazy TV programmer, who's programs are of questionable quality to be polite and he tries to find the next best thing in order to get more audience. And the he finds out Videodrome, a show like no other, with an extremely violent imagery. But during his watch he starts to have some disturbing visions and at times it is hard to understand if watch he saw was real or not. In general David Cronenberg is master on making something unsettling feel close to the watcher as if he is facing them and Videodrome is no exception.
To the prophetic , the main theme of the movie is how over-exposure in violence can cause significant mental and psychical damage to the brain and body. Now the idea that watch violence in movies and television will make cruel yourself, it is wrong for nowadays we have dozens of violent TV shows and the global crime rate is lower than when Videodrome came out, but I won't disagree with that watching mindless slaughter in your free time it isn't the best way to have a good time. For instance in Game of Thrones a lot of horrible events take place, but the reason they are so painful is that we care about the characters in it, while in Passion of Christ we only see Jesus becoming out of the blue a bloody pulp ( I make any religious remark I judge the film as it is) so yes horrific but why?
And that is I think what Cronenberg try to warn us. Also if you are bit conspiracy crazy with that film you will either have a blast or go nuts. If you want to watch it do it at your own digression, for it has also scenes for which Cronenberg is famous for.
All in all it is a really interesting film and a must watch for anyone with strong opinion about the way violence is presented to the audience, I hypothesis you will find a lot of meat in that flick.""I am not a Woody Allen fan but have got to hand it to him for this - A film with Owen Wilson as the male lead that I found thought provoking? Come on that couldn't be right! But it is! I myself have often wished for that 24 hours back in 1976, just for one day and wondered how I would perceive it now as opposed to how I did back then, well, Midnight in Paris comes close to that reality for 'Gil' (Owen Wilson)and I found it captivating - I spent a lot of time in Paris in 1998/1999 and it was wonderful to see so many places I had spent time appearing in the film. If you are a romantic you are going to love Gil and 'Gil in Paris' - I am and I did - Gil saw Paris with his heart not his eyes - I am a musician and have found many places inspiring, I go to them often even if it's just to strum a few chords on the guitar, if you also pursue anything similar then you will love this movie - If you like to hear the Rhythm of Paris then I guarantee the opening and closing title music will haunt you!""I finally watched CHAPPiE almost 2 tears after it was released when I found out Yo-Landi and Ninja of the band Die Antwoord were in the movie. Other wise I would have never watched, the reason being I mistakenly thought this was a kids movie. BTW There are several Die Antwoord songs in the sound track. For me CHAPPiE turned out to be a fantastic sci-fi action adventure drama. It was written by Neill Blomkamp & Terri Tatchell and directed by Neill Blomkamp, both also did (District 9) and has similar style. If you liked District 9 you will surely enjoy this movie. Its to bad the trailer didn't convey the gist of the movie better because the main thing I remembered was a child like robot scared and cowering behind a rock and what looked like a corporate militia trying to get it back like a different kids movie I didn't like. It makes me wonder how many people had a similar impression and thought this was a kids movie so never watched or how many parents took their kids to see it at the theater or rented the DVD only to realize to late it's not a kids movie and be completely dis- enthralled. In my opinion this is why reviews are all over the place, because so many people came away not seeing what they expected. That's a tragedy because CHAPPiE didn't do well enough for there to be a sequel. This was supposed to be a trilogy and I'm sure there would have been an evolution of characters and added complexity to the sequels.""WHAT'S SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD ABOUT? A geek must battle his girlfriend's exes for her heart. Literally battles them.
IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: B) Director Edgar Wright has directed and co-written two of my all-time favorite comedies, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. The appeal of his work lies in both the originality of his direction (even the film editing is funny) and in the sharpness of his screenplays. His latest, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, represents a step up for Wright as a director, but sadly, it's also a step down for him as a screenwriter. In terms of visuals and sound, Scott Pilgrim is one of the most creative films of the past decade, and I don't mean merely in a ""Wow, that CGI looks cool!"" kind of way. The film-making itself is endlessly inventive as Wright blends the styles of comic books, video games, and rock n'roll into a charming love letter to geek culture.
Michael Cera (Arrested Development, Juno) successfully stretches a bit beyond playing the affable, clueless nice guy role he's made a career out of. Those elements are still there, but so is an edge of selfishness and, ultimately, growth. What's more, he impresses with speed, flexibility, and coordination in the film's many fight scenes. He also really plays the guitar in the musical scenes, impressively shredding it up.
The plot, as it is, finds amateur guitarist Scott Pilgrim having to battle the ""seven evil exes"" of his new girlfriend, who is quite literally the girl of his dreams (played by Live Free or Die Hard's Mary Elizabeth Winstead). In the mix are a gay roommate, an Asian high-school girlfriend (one of the film's highlights), a movie star (Captain America's Chris Evans), a super-powered Vegan (Superman Returns' Brandon Routh), a trail of broken hearts, and a battle of the bands. It's fun stuff, but a film this intentionally silly needs two things to blossom: more laughs and a shorter running time. Scott Pilgrim clocks in at nearly two hours; it should be about 20 minutes shorter, and the pacing lags in spots.
What's more, while the film is quite funny, it is neither as clever nor as packed with humor as Wright's previous movies. Too many jokes fall flat, perhaps because too many revolve around Scott's roommate and his sex life. I have no problem with sympathetic portrayals of LGBT characters, but the character isn't well-rounded. His sexuality gradually becomes his only defining characteristic. Also, Scott's relationship with the female lead goes from zero-chemistry awkwardness to physical intimacy without any transition in between. I know the film wasn't striving for realism, but even by movie standards, that was a stretch. Though there is entertainment and ingenuity to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there are also some flaws and, depending on your tastes, potentially offensive content.""Im a sci-fi fan, but top of my list of best movies ever are the likes of Deer Hunter,Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, Cookos Nest, Interstellar, Alien , Predator, Apocalypse Now and Prometheus..
This is up there, the start of the movie with no spoilers is the most exciting I've seen in years!. The pulsating excitement to meet what u don't know, the unknown!. Its an amazingly well directed film!. Actors are also amazing!. If they could have assembled all the threads at the end i would have given it a ten!. But the only movie that ever made a ten with me is Deer Hunter. So its a 8.7 movie for me (9 is closest) But best movie I've seen for a long time. May be to short for the topic, that's all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Silent Hill is a movie you need to watch twice to fully understand it. I liked the film as it has lots of plots you have to put together in order to understand it as Dhalia claims Rose's daughter is hers which later on figures out is partly true. There are some mistakes in the movie like it wasn't shown where people live but as everything is empty, it guides out the sect church is not only the shelter, it's their home as darkness happens very oftenly. So whenever they live, there's a question how do they get their food. It was little explained in the hotel part but 30 years after there were no food left so even the film is not about the food you can not miss this part out. When the Rose came on the gas station, around her neck is the locket but when she was entering the town, she was wearing a pendant. Why is Rose unconsciousness if the vehicle hasn't collided in the rocks? Greatest mystery is tho took the Sharon out of the vehicle, was it Dhalia or the Alessa's dark side? In one part you see Sharon is hiding in Dhalia's apartment when fanatics are looking for her. So why she hasn't look for her (foster) mother and why was Dhalia in the town at that time? It's a little unexplained as Alessa hasn't hijacked her as the Sharon was found in the apartment later on.
I liked the end as the Silent Hill is just an ordinary abandoned town for unexpected visitors but you noticed on the end she is driving the same road which was cut off when the Cybil, police woman wanted to get back in the police station located in Brahms. When they entered they were in the second dimension so they couldn't leave the town afterwards. When the Alessa killed those fanatics, evil won that time and you can reassure that as Dhailia asked Alessa what have you became? She didn't forgive those people, she treacherously killed them. Rose is going back from the town with Sharon but you have to keep in mind, when she was in the underground Alessa's demon merged with Rose so Rose became immortal as the priestess Cristabella stab her in the heart but she wasn't killed. Demon took her soul so when she got home trough the road, her soul was trapped in the Silent Hill. You may notice the weather outside, it's foggy while her husband is waiting her the same room but in the other dimension when is sun. It's explained in the school part, demon does not want them so the school is only abandoned and there are no people. That's the reason entering the town was possible for them but was closed for the Rose.""I have to completely echo what has been said, just what on earth do so called ""professional"" or ""expert"" reviewers expect from a film like this to rate it so bad and moan how it could be so much better etc?. This is a classic and possibly the best example I've seen to say and indicate that we should ignore and disregard the so called ""professional"" or ""expert"" reviewers and put more weight onto what the general public movie fans say instead.
For me this is probably the best film I've sen in the last year and I've seen loads. And certainly the biggest difference between what so called ""experts"" have said and felt myself.
Not to sure on the genre though as it has a bit of everything, action, thriller, drama & even a hint of sci-fi as well as being quite emotional in parts. And either way you see the film going it at least has an ending you cant really find anything to complain about which is a rare thing to see in films these days.
The cast and acting is top notch and with the story pretty much of award winning standard I thought. Story is good, flows well and is easy to follow and get into. Though the sci-fi element is slightly unrealistic in today's world, but maybe more realistic in the next 20 years or so.
For me, a great film, certainly not less than an 8/10 and came close to giving it a 9. So do yourself a favour, ignore the so called ""professionals"" & ""experts"" for once and watch what is actually a great film.""I can't say I fully understand the zeal of ""The Boondock Saints'"" (1999) cult following, but I had fun with it  I'd give it an 8 out of 10 for being unusual and unexpectedly diverting.
I don't really see it as a crime thriller  it's more like an absurdly violent situation-comedy. It borrows its tone and style from 1994's ""Pulp Fiction,"" not to mention its own shock-comedy throwaway scene involving an accidentally discharged sidearm.
Like its superior inspiration, its formula is creating quirky, likable characters with some funny dialogue, and then raising the tension by placing them in the midst of graphic violence. It mostly succeeds  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus' characters are endearing, cool and easy to root for. I laughed out loud a few times, and I can see how their telegenic antiheroes would attract a devoted fandom.
The directing seemed choppy and even amateurish. I noticed this right from the opening credits, which are awkwardly spliced with the on screen introduction of the main characters.
The screen writing is a little spotty, too  we're never told, for example, how its two protagonists come to be such proficient assassins. (Are they former military? Is there a joke here I'm missing about them being ""blessed,"" consistent with the ""saints"" motif and all the references to Catholicism?) Nor do we get much meaningful information about their motivations. (Their bloody crusade begins only when they kill several gangsters in self- defense, then they seem to pursue a life of vigilantism as an afterthought.) Finally, our antiheroes seem refreshingly real and identifiable, while other characters (Willem Dafoe's detective and Billy Connolly's mafia hit-man) seem cartoonish enough to populate a farce like ""The Naked Gun"" series).
Again, though  this was fun. I'd recommend it.""im not a big fan of football nor sex jokes and this kind of movies in general. but this one! at one point i was worried about getting a stroke or something, i watched it just to fall in sleep and because i saw a fx making of on youtube.but i just could not stop laughing,and laughing hard.
the movie is an example of effort in all matters and an example of how Hollywood culture in general is just worthless as in years they haven't come with something like this or other movies. where creativity,effort and risk just leads natural.
here you can see really good and new attempts of everything,action, comedy,jokes,script, i would dare to say that for the first time i see actors (Acting).
if Hollywood would full produce this movie there would be. Ben Affleck,Vin Diesel,Mark Wahlberg or tom cruise as actors and for so in order to respect (Their) fame and image. 90% of the jokes, script,editing,action,etc,etc. would be taken off.
And even if they didn't. the simply fact of one of them being there would trash the whole movie.
this movie represents what cinema was created for. like it or not. be it your kind of movie or not. in general terms this is what films are meant for.""Ray Charles defines soul and country. He was at times a harsh man, a man desiring perfection. His discography is massive and the quality of his performances are stunning. All this after growing up blind. Instrumentally, he drove the train. For Jamie Foxx to take on this man as a dramatic character calls for real courage. Not only does he capture the physical presence of the man, he captures his movements, his idiosyncrasies, his voice. What criticism there is of this performance seems to bank on there being no reason to have a bio-pic because to treat a contemporary subject is always lacking--the person is still too fresh in our minds. This may be true with Oliver Stone because he not only presents a character, but he gets in his own political agenda. Here, the movie is a way of doing honor to a great performer. There are also criticisms of Charles holding back on supporting civil rights. Well, nobody said he didn't have his failings; it's all the more reasons put forth an accurate portrayal of the man. Foxx is superb.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In 1963 Jackson, Mississippi, Aibileen Clark is a black maid who raises the children of Elizabeth Leefolt, a white woman suffering from postpartum depression, who refuses to acknowledge her daughter Mae Mobley other than by disciplining her. Aibileen's best friend is Minny Jackson, an outspoken black maid who works for Hilly Holbrook's senile mother, Mrs. Walters. While Minny may have an outspoken attitude, she has won favor with her great cooking skills. Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan is a young white woman returning home after graduating from the University of Mississippi to discover that her mother Charlotte has fired her childhood nanny and maid Constantine.
Much to her mother's chagrin, Skeeter aspires to have a successful writing career. After spending time with Aibileen, forward-thinking Skeeter becomes increasingly disgusted with the attitudes and poor treatment of her white socialite friends towards their ""help"" (they even begin campaigning to require the maids to only use the restroom in dingy, shabby, and non-air conditioned outhouses in the extreme heat and exposed to the elements, with Hilly saying that **** and decides to write about the experiences of their housekeepers. The maids are reluctant to comply, afraid of retribution from their employers and the Anti-Civil Rights movement, but Aibileen eventually agrees, becoming emotionally attached to the project as it allows her to find closure on the death of her son four years earlier. Minny also complies after Hilly fires her for using the guest-bathroom and refusing to go out in tornado weather to use the help's toilet, and later makes false claims that Minny had been fired for stealing, making it nearly impossible for her to get new employment.""Terry Malloy is a dockworker. He was a very promising boxer until, upon instruction, he deliberately took a dive. His career never recovered. The waterfront is run my Union/mob boss Johnny Friendly and Terry's brother Charley is his right-hand man. Terry tries to not get involved in the skulduggery, and also keeps his mouth shut when the law intervenes. However, his conscience is pricked when he becomes involved with Edie, the sister of a man Johnny had killed (an event Terry had a minor, non-forewarned part in). Friendly gets wind of Terry's change of heart and now Terry's life is in danger.
Great movie, an absolute classic. Solid, gritty plot. Good direction by Elia Kazan.
Marlon Brando gives one of the greatest performances in cinematic history - the Best Actor Oscar was very well deserved (this after being nominated each year for the previous three years). Supporting cast are great too - four of them got supporting actor/actress nominations - Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Lee Cobb and Rod Steiger - and Eva Marie Saint won an Oscar.
The movie itself won the 1955 Best Picture Oscar, plus seven other Oscars including Best Director for Kazan.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Milos Formans, ""Amadeus"" is a film that for me could have had the potential to be either a fascinating insight into how a pointless rivalry destroyed the lives of two good men or an overlong bore that failed to intrigue me as I have got literally zero interest in music but I found that this film fell into the latter category and found it to be fantastic. This film doesn't really have one good character to get behind, everyone has hopes and loses that you all feel, everyone is flawed and down to earth, I found myself never being able to ultimately pick one side in the film. Both characters are developed perfectly You understand just how much their music means to both of them and why they need to hold on to it, it gives a fantastic insight into there mind sets and makes them more investing as well as interesting characters. Every thing in this film production wise is fantastic all the eccentric costumes, palaces and gutters look perfect. F Murray Abraham won an Academy Award for his performance in this film and I've seen few performances more deserving he is so convincing as a conflicted man shamed with his inability to advance beyond mediocrity, he's perfect at balancing both the young idealistic and older fragile versions of his character, he always had me engaged and he was truly amazing in this movie. Tom Hulce who I have seen literally nothing else from is fantastic in this movie, he's over the top laugh, excitable tendencies yet committed nature made him an entertaining character to watch and was the perfect opposition for Abraham. It's also a very dark film to watch at times, the way in which these two men's lives begin to fall apart isn't truly heartbreaking as ,like is said, they are developed perfectly so you understand the stakes of their rivalry. But I loved that they didn't necessarily hate each other but were really jealous of each other and their eventual bond towards the end of the film made for an extremely satisfying conclusion to their arc. One of my only real issues with this movie is the love story between Mozart and his wife, it gets extremely repetitive and dull after a while and his wife was completely unlikable to I ultimately just ended up not caring at anything of her turmoil. Another issue was the present day story line with the mental asylum it was mainly he Actor who played the priest who gave a fairly bad performance, just relying on the same facial expressions to carry his portrayal and got on my nerves after a while.
Amadeus is a fantastic film, it's got no one side or character to route for, everyone is perfect developed, it looks stunning in every aspect it was just the love story and some aspects of the present day story line that began to bother me at times which are only minor issues in a much more impressive picture.
88%/A-""If you are not a fan of Mr. Kevin Spacey, you will become one. The movie revolves around this one ordinary person, whose life is going to become not so ordinary. A hidden theme which I think movie is trying to give is, the violence and hatred towards homosexuals. Just a classic movie, like none other. The plot of the movie is more beautifully acted than written. Also the low parenting skills are shown here, and how teenagers behave when not given proper guidance. The family comes prior to anything else is beautifully taught. A middle age couple around 40 also needs to have his/her sexual needs satisfied. So couples especially women, do keep that in mind, else don't blame that no one told. The teenagers in the film acted well above the expected maturity.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In 1960, Stanley Kubrick released his colossal, towering, gargantuan, monumental, epic blockbuster SPARTACUS!!!! Okay, it isn't that spectacular, but it is a pretty dang good flick.
Spartacus stars Kirk Douglas as an impudent Thracian slave. Thracians, as depicted in the film, were a race of people known for a particular physical characteristic - they had chin dimples the size of walnuts.
Because Spartacus is such an uppity wisenheimer, he is sentenced to a life as a gladiator. Not that it's all bad. He gets to work out a lot and is ""whipped"" into incredible physical shape. Also, he receives occasional visits from another slave who also happens to be a tasty dish named Varinia (played as a genteel aristocrat by Jean Simmons).
Douglas does a fine job as the brooding gladiator. Other standouts include Charles Laughton as Gracchus; not to be confused with Crassus, a gourmet who likes both escargot and shellfish, played by Laurence Olivier. Peter Ustinov provides some Oscar-winning semi- comic relief as the sniveling sycophant Batiatus.
Another major character in the film is Antoninus, played by Tony Curtis. Tony (which is short for Antoninus) is a ""singer"" of ""songs"". His ""songs"" are just poems spoken in a Bronx accent.
During the course of the movie, Spartacus escapes from gladiator school and assembles a considerable army of fellow undergraduates. Spartacus is well-loved by his men, and this is illustrated in one particularly moving scene.
When the Romans capture Spartacus and his men, Crassus threatens to kill them all unless someone betrays their leader (who Crassus believes is a communist). Spartacus - in a heroic effort to spare his men - stands up to reveal himself, but Antoninus beats him to the punch. He jumps to his sandaled feet and yells out, ""I'm Spartacus."" This sets off a chain reaction. Another guy stands up and shouts, ""I'm Spartacus."" And another, ""I'm Spartacus."" Another, ""I'm Spartacus."" And so on.
The Romans were very frustrated by this, because now instead of one pesky Spartacus, they found that they had to deal with a whole slew of Spartaci.
Legend has it that this event spawned an entire generation of scofflaws. Whenever a centurion confronted a non-Roman for some infraction - say a speeding chariot - the inevitable happened: ""Name?"" ""Spartacus."" ""All right wise guy. Thirty days in the dungeon.""
Anyway, this is a very good film that I highly recommend. And, if I may, I'd like to close out this ""review"" with one of Antoninus' ""songs"":
""When the blazing wind hangs low in the western sky when the sun flies away to the mountain when the ""song"" of the crow scares the locusts from the fields and maidens sleep in the sea foam at last at twilight time...""
Or something like that.""Now I know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this, but I think that this is the best film of 2014 (and Birdman is not) Why? I feel like I got more out of this film, I thought it had a much more clever script, and this seems like the kind of movie that can inspire people with the smallest of hopes. Don't get me wrong, I think Birdman is a 10/10, but this was more of a 10/10 I suppose, with Birdman I well definitely give credit where credit is due, like the acting and cinematography were top notch, it's amazing how it was done in one shot (i know it actually wasn't, you don't have to tell me) But I feel like Whiplash will accompany my thoughts long after seeing it, just cause of how complex it is, maybe I didn't understand Birdman, and when I do I'll change my mind, right now this is not the case. Whiplash is amazing""The movie focused really well on the life of MS Dhoni before he became a household name. Sushant Singh Rajput did a great job. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. We all only see how a player plays on the ground but we don't want to know his struggle and his hidden story. This movie tells the hidden story of Mr. Dhoni and reveals his actual character. Sushant was absolutely brilliant and flawless in the movie. this movie was not only an entertainer but also keeps you hooked to it for a good three hours. And rarely has a Bollywood movie been this good. There are no secrets to success it is the result of preparation and Hard Work.
In last this is the best ever sports based films ever made. I""What I would describe as a feel good film, a one for all the family irrespective of age or background. Eddie the Eagle is a true story of seer grit and determination and portrays the kind of attitude many people lack in this 21st century.
The story starts in young Eddies neighbourhood where we quickly learn that he has a dream of going to the Olympics and is prepared to make huge sacrifices in order to achieve this goal. This vision is said to have started while reading a book on the summer Olympics but after a spell of bad luck and poor choices Eddie struggles to find the sport that is right for him. It's during these early stages of the film where you either decide if you are going to see the film out or call it quits. Having been disappointed by the family's acting from the beginning as I felt they lacked true emotion, I was somehow transfixed into wanting to see where this story was going.
I watched on and am so pleased I did. The film was written very well and Taron Edgerton played a very believable Eddie. Although with films there is always going to be some bending of the true events, I felt that the story did a fantastic job of portraying Eddies journey to the Olympics.
There is a lot of comedy in this film and I believe it helps add to our love towards Eddie, we want him to succeed regardless of the result. Although he doesn't come first, he does gain a victory in himself. The real message of the film is that regardless of being an underdog if you want something enough and are prepared to put in the hours of training and preparation then you are more than capable of achieving it.
If your feeling down or need some motivation, then give this one a go.""I am not a Salman Khan Fan but this film is excellent because its about emotions, strength and being tenacious. Courage is to fail and get back again to fight. Its about keeping your spirit alive for whatsoever the reason is.""Sultan"" is an Indian romantic sports-drama film. Its a typical Bollywood movie much different to AAmir Khan's Danga. The movie should not have had so many songs which makes the movie lengthy. Never thought Sultan will become one of my fav movies. ""Khoon mein tere mitti Mitti mein tera khoon Khoon mein tere mitti Mitti mein tera khoon""
""Upar Allah niche dharti Beech mein tera junoon"" are my favorite lines from the film. Films about Fighting always has takeaways. Here there are many.""This is a great movie! I heard about it first and when I saw clips of it in documentaries, I understood the references/parodies in cartoons and TV shows. Cartoons like RUGRATS, JOHNNY BRAVO and FAIRLY ODDPARENTS parodied this movie as well as TV shows like Saturday NIGHT LIVE and THE NOSTALGIA CRITIC. I saw the movie in all it's entirety in the summer of 2012 (which is the right time to see it), when I was assigned to compare and contrast the paintings of Norman Rockwell and Frank Capra movies for my summer class ""Painting and the Cinematic Image"" at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Being a movie buff, I started to fall in love with that movie and realized how beautiful and wonderful it is. Jimmy Stewart makes a great performance in this movie. His character George Baily has hopes and dreams and helps out his friends and family. An angel gives him an answer to a what if question of his and he learns the hard way on the importance of being there! Various scenes in the movie feel like a Norman Rockwell painting because it captures the moment in a dramatic and sometimes humorous manner. Give it a watch it is fun for the entire family! Not rated, but in my humble opinion it is rated G.""Frozen is one of those animated movies that delights adults, small children and every age in between. I don't know what the secret is, but my niece was a fan of the movie and of the characters when she was 2y.o.a., Frozen being the only movie she was able to sit in front of, from beginning to end, without getting up or getting bored. Frozen has had the same effect on children all over the world.
There are many reasons why this move has been able to enchant adults and children alike: 1/ This is a version of the traditional folk-tale of the Winter Witch. It doesn't matter that the story has been significantly modified, the mythological elements live in the psyche of all us, humans, and when they are matched outside, magic happens. Ask Joseph Campbell. 2/ The movie has a good combination of comedy, drama, romance, adventure, archetypal characters, and some funny 'pets' we all love straight-away. 3/ We all want to believe in magic, and there is plenty in this movie. 4/ The animation is excellent. 5/ The movie is very entertaining but it also has substance.
As an adult viewer, the narrative, the quality of the soundtrack and the character composition are the main things for me not to get bored or disinterested. Frozen pleased me on all of those fronts. I thought that this was a very un-Disney Disney movie, or said differently, old-style fab Disney not the more commercial Disney of the last 25 years.
One of the things I loved the most in Frozen was the update of both the male and female archetypes, both finally brought to the 21st century. The crappola of other Disney female characters was wed-out, so this is a movie with strong, independent, stubborn clever women, who are also human beings, imperfect and able to learn from their mistakes. The figure of the prince is also updated, a prince perhaps doesn't have a crown or a title, or is not even Mr Perfect, it is a good-hearted man who cares for his lady.
Frozen is one for the first truly modern Disney movies. It shows that Disney is able, when they want, to produce outstanding memorable films as those I grew up with. For that to happen they have to stop considering children idiots. I found that impression confirmed when I watched Zootopia, also a great animated film.
Overall, Frozen is great.""India where Bollywood is center of Hindi movie industry it is very difficult to see a movie with a blend of a good story line actors who really play the role as if its actually his real life. Manjhi is based on true story where nawaz portrays the character of Dasharath manjhi, we knew that a person called manjhi has cut down a mountain to pay a way between 2 cities so that no one will face the problem which his wife had faced through. But know one knew what struggle he had gone though to complete this huge task. This movie beautifully portrays the story which will leave you overwhelmed. Radhika apte also plays a strong character of a beautiful wife and has given her above par performance. Director Ketan Mehta has given anything he could to make this biography come to life. and one of the important thing not to miss apart from performance are the dialogues, Dialogues are best part of the movie which will leave you mesmerized. Over all Manjhi is a must watch.""I watched this movie after beating the game and it was amazing!
It filled tons of missing plot information that you don't gather from the video game.
I love how it ties from the movie to the video game as well with the ending of the movie and the beginning of the video game.
I think in order to appreciate the movie you need to get the story line of the game.
I can see how the story line just by the movie alone would be very confusing to viewers however regardless of if you watched the movie first then played the video game, vice versa, you will be asking yourself questions without the other half.
Regardless though as a witness to both sides, I absolutely loved it!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The makers of this movie did an excellent job of bringing Charles Dickens's novel, a Christmas Carol, to life in a motion picture. This movie lets you experience the changes that overcame Scrooge in his journey with the three spirits as he learns to embrace Christmas in his heart once more. You start at the cemetery were Marley is about to be buried. You see a man that is so unwilling to part with his gold that he takes Marley's gold as payment for his burial. As he walks through the streets that everyone that is merry avoids him or falls silent at his approach. Skipping to 7 years later you see that he has not changed at all. Until he returns home and meets Marley's ghost and begins to fear for himself. As he travels with the Ghost of Christmas Past you see Scrooge soften and wish for the Christmases of his past. Then the Ghost of Christmas Present makes him regret that he will not have a family to make merry with come Christmas Day. The Ghost of Christmas Future then makes Scrooge strive for a chance to change himself so that he will not be remembered as the cruel, gold-lover man that people are remembering him by in the shadow he is shown. I would recommend ages 8+ to watch this as Marley dislocating his jaw is kind of gruesome.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I had heard many great things about this movie over the years like how it was one of the best non-Disney animated movies ever made. Actually, creator Brad Bird did in fact go on to work for Disney (or more specifically Pixar), but it's still a Warner Bros. movie. It's great to have this little gem around and I'm so glad that it seems to be getting more popular all the time. Originally, it was thought to be obscure, but now it's praised for being the great film that it is. I admit that there are some things that could have been done better. We never do find out where the Iron Giant came from.
I guess the implication is that he was from another planet. Was he supposed to be used as a weapon by aliens invading Earth? If so, that means things are going to get a lot worse now. I do believe it's said he's from a planet already destroyed or something. What I love about this film is the pacing. Nothing feels rushed. It's hard to do that with a movie less than 90 minutes long. It's a little clichéd at times, but it's still a great movie. The plot is fairly simple. It's about a robot that crash lands on Earth and befriends a little boy. I guess it's like ET only with a giant robot.
The best part of this movie is easily at the end. It's when the Giant sacrifices himself to stop a missile from blowing up a town. I certainly felt chills when I saw that. I was thinking it would end when the military showed up, but I still got the big climax at the end. We even get a setup for a sequel, more or less as we actually see the Giant having his parts come back together at the very end. I guess it's all open to interpretation what happens next. By the way, the idea of his body parts coming back together is freaking amazing. We get characters that act like real people. I also love the 1950's setting. It's as good as people make it out to be. ***1/2""*** This review may contain spoilers *** For me, this is film - making at its absolute finest.

The scene where the creator of the show tries to persuade Truman for not leaving it was well written. Truman making a photograph of his lost love Sylvia out of mag zines was also quite good. Personality of Truman could have been explored in a better way. They way he starts doubting everything happening around and deducing was not rightly justified.Many faults can be ignored if this movie was made as a light humor with fantasy.The whole idea of incorporating different characters in Truman life is quite creative in same ways. Like usage of his friend Marlon to insure him that everything in his life is fine and natural.That was also a well written scene. All in all, a great movie to watch, Thanks for making it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Conjuring 2 is a really good horror movie you should as fan must see.
All I had in the beginning the feeling it corresponded over with Insidious. it is actually a kind of the same story so it can be right. (I will not give spoilers so you have to see the movie to understand what I mean)
The start of the movie begins slowly but at the first time you be on the sofa glued to watch the movie.The music at the main menu sets the tone actually what for movie The conjuring 2 is.
Really well done! I found the film very believable. But the only thing i was missing was more information about the head (demon) person in the story because it was more about ""poltergeist"" and the family. (Sorry still a small spoiler) I found the location very suited to the film. Each scene what happened in their Home was creepy, exciting and good.A must if you like Horror and at not have night afraid to sleep;)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** As this film opens our protagonist wakes in a large lift that takes him to a green area surrounded by high walls. He has no memory of what happened before, initially he doesn't even know his name although he later recalls that it is Thomas. There are other people there already; all teenage boys and none have any memory of what happened before they got there or knowledge of why they have been put there. Thomas is told that once a month a new person arrives along with vital supplies. He also learns that the area they live in is known as The Glade and the wall contain a giant maze; giant doors into the maze are open during the day and closed at night runners go into the maze during the day hoping to find a way out and if any are trapped in the maze when the doors close they will never be seen again. Apparently creatures known as Grievers come out at night although nobody has seen one and lived to tell the tale. That is until Thomas enters the maze to help two other boys and is caught inside. Not only do they manage to survive the night Thomas actually manages to kill a Griever. Things soon start to change; Thomas and another boy discover that the Grievers are man-made, they think they have found a way out and then the elevator delivers a new person; the first girl to be sent to the glade. Some people think that Thomas will be the one to get them out of the maze but one boy, Gally, is convinced that he has brought danger to them and insists that he is punished for what he has done. Sides are taken and a group make a bid for freedom.
When I started watching this I wasn't expecting too much perhaps because of that I found myself pleasantly surprised. The idea of having a group of boys trapped in an enclosed location immediately made me think of 'Lord of the Flies' although the society depicted here isn't quite so fragile even if Gally's actions appear to push it that way. The fact that the maze changed each night and contained dangers reminded me of the Sci-fi film 'Cube'; although with this films young adult demographic it is far less violent. That doesn't mean there is no sense of real danger; it gets pretty intense at times and has moments when it is genuinely scary. A fair number of characters die including some one would expect to survive. The film has a good look with the maze having a real feel to it. The cast, which featured nobody I recognised in major roles, did a solid job making the viewer believe in the characters and their situation. There are some weaknesses, mostly when we are finally told why the boys were selected and why the maze was created in the first place, also the ending felt entirely like a set up for the next film in the series which of course it was. Overall though I found this to be a solid story and will keep an eye open for the sequel.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was Marilyn's first musical comedy, and my favorite, partly because is includes Jane Russell as an equal, making a musical comedy team. Generally, when you have a comedy team, you want them clearly differentiated from each other, both physically and personality -wise, but not so different that they can't relate to each other. Here, their hair color is as different as can be, Jane is a little taller, has a more elongate face, and MM tends to often quint her eyes vs. Jane's round eyes. Jane tends to be forthright and loud. Marilyn tends to be more devious, often with a naïve little girl persona. This contrast is most vividly displayed in how they sing ""Bye Bye, Baby"". Jane is prancing around in front of a men's Olympic team, singing loud and up tempo. MM then sings it slowly, softly, sexily, with feeling, to her shy nerdy fiancé(Gus), who is prohibited by his father from sailing to France with Marilyn. Besides his father being rich, Marilyn feels comfortable with Gus because he's shy, brings her gifts all the time and is easily manipulated. Also, Jane's attitude in what she most wants in a husband superficially is as different from Marilyn's as their hair color. Marilyn is a gold-digger first. If they happen to be young, handsome and/or athletic, as Jane likes, that's an added bonus.
The script has Marilyn traveling to Paris, as a showgirl. Jane, also a show girl, accompanies her as a sort of chaperone, charged with trying to keep her out of compromising situations, to satisfy Gus's father, who suspects she is just a dumb blonde gold digger, who doesn't love Gus. Gus's father secretly sends a detective(Mr. Malone) to check up on Marilyn's doings. Thus, Jane and Malone have opposite goals as relates to documenting some scandalous incident. At first, Jane hates him, but then she realizes she's attracted to him.
Malone takes a seemingly compromising photo of Marilyn being embraced by an elderly monocled diamond mine owner(Charles Coburn, as Piggy). By trickery, the girls steal the roll of film and have the picture developed to show to Piggy, inducing him to give Marilyn his wife's expensive tiara(headpiece) to keep her quite about the apparent incident. Apparently, even without the photo, Malone communicates what he saw to Gus's father. As a result, his financial support of the girls is cut off and Gus tells Marilyn their relationship is finished. Well, Piggy's wife discovers her tiara missing, and assumes Marilyn stole it, because she was so impressed when shown it. In turn, Marilyn discovers it missing from her jewelry box....The rest of the story I leave for you to discover for yourself, except to say that there is a predictable happy ending.
Despite the most memorable song being ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"", we might think of the theme song being ""Two Little Girls from Little Rock"", since the pair sing it in the very beginning, before the title shows up, and again at the end. Marilyn sings ""Diamonds are..."" in a lavish stage production, dressed in flashy pink, as are the chorus dancers, Marilyn being surrounded by their male partners. This is later followed by Jane's very dynamic version in a courtroom, with blonde wig, to resemble Marilyn whom she was impersonating. This scene will probably be the comedic highlight of the film for you.
The 3 songs I have mentioned in the above were composed by Jule Styne and Leo Robin for the prior stage version of this story. Two lesser songs were composed by Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Adamson for this film version: ""When Love Goes Wrong"", sung by Marilyn, and ""Anyone Here for Love?"", sung by Jane in the presence of the Olympic team.
Malone asks J.R. how 2 girls so different in their attitudes toward men can be such good friends? I don't remember her response, but I will say they trust each other and don't compete for the same men.
Marilyn is characterized as being ignorant about most things, but claims she tries to act dumb, because that's what men want.
Available as part of the Marilyn Premier DVD Collection, as well as on it's own.
The subsequent ""Gentlemen Marry Brunettes"" I haven't seen, but is said to be a spoof of the musical comedy genre, with Jane sometimes trying to imitate Marilyn. It's rating is very low, but some reviewers say it is nonetheless quite entertaining.""I can relate it when someone doesn't rely on a macho attitude.. It's how I want to be too.. I can't be serious.. I must be crazy.. Or else I panic.. Instead of healthy socializing.. I choose crazy.. Crazy is always the right way.. I never get too close to people.. Because when you get too close.. They start influencing you right or wrong.. I hate the idea I have no control over myself.. I must always be in control of my own actions and thoughts.. Therefor, I choose crazy over social.. If that means doing my own thing whether it's walking around in an elf suit, but with a healthy clean conscious, so it be.. If a woman doesn't want me because I'm not macho enough, then I guess I've outgrown them.. And macho is not what I'm in for.. Too bad.. If that even means staying alone, I will.. Because there's no greater joy than that of a peaceful mind..""OK so i see a lot of hate for this movie and its clear most people don't understand it. Its a comedy. Its very good at what its trying to do. My wife and i were in tears laughing at this movie, we thought it was one of the funniest we have seen in years. If you like horror comedy than this is for you. If you have a weak sense of humor or are easily grossed out don't even bother. You ll just add to the perception that its not a good movie which isn't true. Just don't take it seriously like the idiots around here and you'll love it. God i saw one review complaining about how the end could never legally happen. Duh. Its a joke. Great movie. 10/10 if your not an idiot.""I would give this movie a ten out of ten simply because it reminds me of my favorite smartphone (more like #dumbphone) game ever, Angry Birds. Such a simply plot, such justified anger. That game was revolutionary.
The movie made me laugh. To be honest with you, I watched it on Hulu as amusing background noise while my wife, son, and I went about our business in the house. But we all watched a little bit, we all laughed, and we all agreed it was beyond what we expected for a smartphone game adaptation, which is what this movie is.
""Mighty mighty Eagle! Rescue me!""
Look at that. The music is so catchy, I started writing along!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Milk, released in 2008, was directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Academy Award Winner Dustin Lance Black. Based on a true story, Harvey Milk, elected in 1977, was the first openly gay man to hold a prominent political position. He was served as a city councilman in San Francisco for 11 months until he was assassinated. The movie follows Harvey moving to Castro to shortly after his death. Milk is dedicated to showcasing the accomplishments and impact Harvey Milk made for his community and also a huge step in normalizing gay relationships and friendships in Hollywood.
The movie begins with news clips showing the oppression that the LGBT community was facing during the 1970s. Immediately, we learn that Harvey Milk and the mayor have been assassinated. The movie is guided by a recording that Harvey Milk made of himself in case he was assassinated. Through this recording his timeline begins with his 40th birthday, where he meets Scott, a man much younger than him. Scott and Harvey decide to move to Castro, CA together, where they open up a camera shop. Castro has a large gay population that Scott and Harvey assimilate smoothly into. As a community, they are able to make impactful strides of acceptance and equality which fuels Harvey to run for a city council position. With lots of support from his friends and Scott, Harvey runs multiple times and is elected as a supervisor for city council. Before Harvey's election victory, Harvey and Scott split up, but Harvey pursues a relationship with an unstable alcoholic, Jack. Even though Milk only served 11 months, he was apply to pass the ""Pooper-Scooper"" legislature as well as play a big role in the ""Briggs Initiative,"" that opposed Proposition 6. Harvey also makes many speeches encouraging people to fight for the rights of the gay community and also for everyone to ""Come out!"" As the movie continues, Dan White, another city council supervisor, becomes a more prominent figure. Dan, never seeming too happy or excited about anything, has reservations about the work that Harvey is doing and seems to envy the accomplishments he is making.Dan was struggling with the decisions the board was making and resigned in hopes of getting a different job. Dan's job opportunity falls through, and his job on the board is no longer available for him. Shortly after he resigns, he comes into work one day with a gun and kills both Mayor Moscone and Harvey. As devastating as the ending of this film is, it ends with the inspiring words of Harvey's recording surrounded by the 50,000 people that marched the streets of Castro during his vigil.
Until the time the movie was made, Hollywood had not seen a lot of movies with physical homosexual relationships. I enjoyed the closeness of Harvey and Scott's relationship. From the very beginning, their relationship normalized the idea of a homosexual relationship on screen. They hugged and kissed in both private and public. Their relationship was very emotional and based off of love, which was juxtaposed by the very sexual relationship of Harvey and Jack. As much as Harvey cared for Jack, their relationship was characterized by sexual desire and need. Another criticism of sexuality comes from the idea of a monogamous Harvey Milk. He had more of a sex life than the two relationships portrayed in the film.
The fight against Proposition 6 was a huge focus during the late 1970s. The movie focuses heavily on the religious end echoed by Senator Briggs and Anita Bryant. As much as the population was swayed by the religious argument, religion was portrayed as the major influence of Proposition 6. The influence of political figures and their opinions were mentioned, but the movie focused more on how Harvey was a major politician against Proposition 6. He played a huge role, yet President Carter, Governor Reagan, and other political figures were also very openly against Proposition 6.
As seen with Proposition 6, Milk gets a lot of political attention and recognition for different accomplishments throughout the movie. He played a huge role in these achievements, but the movie glorifies his personal influence and heightens credit the credit he should receive. He was very much a prominent activist, but played more of a team role in life, rather than an individual champion. That being said, he still remained the role of a relatable man. This was increasingly important when displaying a homosexual man. We see his sexuality throughout the movie, but also see him as an accomplished, focused politician. Sean Penn as Harvey Milk retains a humble, down to earth personality from moving to Castro until his death, leading to an Academy Award winning performance as Best Actor.
As there are some drawbacks, this movie was taken positively by both the LGBT community and general population. As some may complain about specific aspects of relationships, like myself, overall the LGBT characters and relationships were portrayed in a groundbreaking way that captivated both homosexual and heterosexual audiences. This kind of representation further pushes our society in understanding and acceptance of the LGBT community through empathy of specific stories like Harvey Milk.""i think it's a perfect movie for kids. I am 7 years old and it was my first Pokemon movie to see. If you haven't watched it, you must watch it if you like Pokemon. i recommend watching Pokemon 3 the movie as well.the part that was the show down with all the Pokemon and the two cats one small one big.it was epic.i think every one should love it! I've only watched 3 movies!the best thing about Pokemon is Pokemon battles. they are awesome!if you want you could get a Pokemon game. i wonder how much people like Pokemon battles in Pokemon games as well as on movies.i have the game Pokemon moon.which Pokemon game do you have?so what do you think about Pokemon and Pokemon movies.""I love this movie! The scene where Beowulf battles the Sea Serpents is STILL (10 years later) the best action sequence ever committed to film. BEE WULF!!!! Along with sweet action, frame composition, artistry, and lovingly calculated swinging CG breasts, the movie has some great themes and lines. Like, ""The Age of Hero's is dead. The Christ God has killed them all and left man kind with nothing but weeping martyrs, fear, and shame."" Sure, CG Malkovich is pretty creepy and does not feel real, but I blame this largely on casting someone whom we know how they should feel. Most of the characters are very well done, especially for being way ahead of it's time.
Zemeckis is the bomb, and this is him at his most fun...""I love movies that can't necessarily be classified by a single genre. Jerry Maguire isn't a chick flick, but it's not a sports film either. Nor is it a traditional comedy. It's possibly all three, but never just one. That's what makes it great. It appeals to both genders equally without alienating either of them.
The title character is played by Tom Cruise in one of his best performances. He's a slimy sports agent who, one day, has an epiphany, realizing he no longer wants to sell lies to his clients, but real relationships. The only problem is he doesn't even know how to have a real relationship in his personal life. At work, he sends out a mission statement that lauds the idea of having less clients to improve quality. This sudden life-changing notion wins over the approval of his cohorts, but his high-level agency disapproves and fires him.
Starting from the ground up, Jerry has nothing and no one to work with. The only people that follow him are a low-level employee, Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).
The chemistry between Cruise and both of his costars is natural that you can't imagine anyone else in those roles. You see him seamlessly transform over the course of the film, only taking notice of it in the end. Honestly, it's very much reminiscent of Pacino in the Godfather--only backwards.
Jerry Maguire equally covers the depth of multiple characters brilliantly. The film not only goes inside the mind of a scuzzbag-turned-nice-guy, but of an athlete. Gooding plays a talented football player with a chip on his shoulder. He's not on his way out of the league, but he's no Jerry Rice either. He's on a middling NFL team and thinks he deserves a bigger paycheck than he gets. He knows he's good, but no one else sees it. The film brings very relatable themes to seemingly unrelatable people. There is more to the movie than demand for money. It's about friendship and knowing what's important in life amidst all the menagerie.
Writer-director Cameron Crowe has a knack for storytelling--already evident by his previous work--but he outdoes himself with this one. Nothing is ever truly predictable, which is an impressive accomplishment considering the type of film. Never is there a dull moment, and the dialogue is so effortlessly perfect without ever feeling contrived. The sappy moments are never that, when any other writer would know no other way. It's a rom-com for the ages and may even be the pinpoint for redefining the genre.
It has aged so well and is still a great watch to this day. Highly recommended for those of you who haven't seen it and are arguing with your other half about what to watch on movie night. I promise you'll both enjoy it.
Twizard Rating: 100""First off this film may not be for everyone, It doesn't lay all its cards on the table, explaining everything in clear black and white terminology.. This is not an easy going popcorn blockbuster!!! What it is, is a subtle, subliminal yet emotional, psychological sci-fi drama, revealing just enough for you to piece together your own interpretation of what is happening. Even through to my second viewing I found myself noticing lots of key points that I had missed, raising my appreciation further. There is a deep sense of wonder as you ponder the mysteries of the unknown and once again it's what you don't see or understand that makes this film so fulfilling.. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, but it is definitely a highly original and inspirational movie full of abstract concepts about consciousness and the nature of reality. For all these reason I'm gonna rate it a high... 8/10""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic crime-solver has been portrayed on film more than any other literary figure. The new version, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, has marketed the sleuth as an action hero instead of an intellectual. To my pleasant surprise, the film itself is true to its source material and Holmes' legendary mind is front and center in the narrative. The recreation of turn-of-the-century London is exquisite in its detail and the story builds steam as it goes on (indeed, I found myself enjoying it more and more as it progressed).
Downey, an American, flawlessly portrays the British lead, while Law's Watson is portrayed as less of a sidekick and more of a partner. The two have fantastic buddy chemistry, and their good- natured bickering is a delight. Parents should be aware that this PG-13 film, while very light on offensive language and sexuality (a woman's bare back is seen, as is a man's bare chest in a different scene, and there is one innuendo) does have a good deal of action violence and some blood. Also, the storyline involves the occult, which is displayed as evil and to be combated, but its portrayal may still make some uncomfortable. Sherlock Holmes comes recommended to those who enjoy action films with substance.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A truly enjoyable and extremely moving film that I would definitely watch again.
From start to finish I was hooked, every character was wonderfully portrayed, the script was excellent and it could be one of the most heart-warming films I have ever seen.
Sandra Bullock displays a wonderful performance, starring as a wealthy 'redneck' type, who befriends a mysterious teenager from a troubled background and invites him into her family home. Along side her family she tries to 'unpeel the onion' and discover 'Big Mikes' roots and the reason for his behaviour.
The entire cast are wonderful, even the kids are amazing actors and really brought the characters to life. So much so that you feel almost as if you are a member of that very family.
Several times throughout this film I was brought to tears, ""Big Mike"" is one of the most tragic yet lovable characters I have ever seen in a film and seeing him bonding with a mother figure for the first time was captured in a very beautiful way. Kudos to the filmmakers for making something so truly special.
Their were a couple of scenes that went on for a little too long, but I think without them it wouldn't have portrayed the emotions of the scenes correctly. Everything happened for a reason, which many filmmakers forget these days!
I've read some reviews on here that accuse this movie of being racist, but look at what I wrote above, doesn't that sound beautiful to you? Race is not relevant in such a moving tale. (Plus in the end she ditches her racist friends...) Other reviews stated this was just a made-for-TV movie that made it to cinema. Well if that's the case TV-movies are my favourite thing!""Harry joins Dumbledore in a quest to discover details about Voldemort's past that could lead to his undoing in the future, all while the teenage trio deal with humorous and heartbreaking relationship woes. This sixth film deftly balances mystery, comedy, and romance for its first two hours, wisely slowing the pace to give its characters room to breathe and grow before thrusting them into the breathless, chilling, and genuinely heartbreaking last half hour. Michael Gambon here gives the definitive portrayal of Dumbledore, and the relatively lighthearted initial tone serve as a brilliant contrast to the earth-shattering encroachment of evil; it truly feels like there's something to lose, and the stakes are set high for the finale.
IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is rated PG. A central character is hit with a killing curse and dies; friends and colleagues mourn around the body. A central character drinks a potion that torments him mentally and emotionally; another goes into convulsions when he accidentally imbibes poison. Several male and female characters kiss, at times passionately.
ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES? Telling the truth, even when it's painful, often paves the way for the triumph of good.. Unity and light bring hope which can dispel darkness and despair. Women like men who display chivalry and treat them with respect.""This movie should be in the canon of movie classics, at least in the sci-fi genre. So many great character actors with an interesting (if rather derivative plot -- but it's a spoof with a twist, so that should be expected). Tim Allen nails the main character and so many others, Alan Rickman as others have mentioned, and Sigourney Weaver in a comical tone, deliver fine performances. It's worth watching multiple times as you're bound to have missed something along the way. Ultimately, it's a feel-good sci-fi without cursing (at least in the expurgated current version) and hardly any gore and a minimum of violence. The visual effects don't look wildly dated either. A great movie!""First of all, Yes I am a Hrithik Roshan Fan but I would never say that Mohenjo-Daro was worth a watch so I am a fan but not a biased movie reviewer. Having said that let's begin this spoiler free review.
I went to see this movie with medium expectation and just to watch Hritik Roshan as i thought they revealed almost everything in promos itself but the movie has lot more than just a revenge drama where our blind hero is beating every villain like a Hit-man. People comparing that with dare devil, I laugh on them as i don't know if they have even seen dare devil (The TV series) or not.
Why to watch:
1.) Excellent Acting of Hritik Rohan and Awesome chemistry with Yami.
2.) A realistic revenge thriller. (Trust me, you will be on board with me once you watch it for yourself)
3.) Connection with lead character will be through out the movie.
4.) Predictable story but it has it's moments and execution when viewer will go WOW.
Why you can skip this:
1.) Not a larger than life scale of this movie with pretty average music.
2.) Predictable story. (Like every revenge saga)
Overall: It's not the best movie of all time but it's definitely worth a watch and deserves to be a HIT, you will not be disappointed.""The Dark Knight Series made me want to learn more about the DC Universe. And the Bat or the Dark Knight made being human among the Gods of the DC world amazing to just watch. I couldn't believe someone could fight super people without an ability of their own. Batman saw that humans one talent was fear over beings who didn't fear anything at all.It's a beautiful thing that Batman was a chosen character to be apart of the Hall of Justice for his amazing feats stopping beings and escaping beings with only gadgets and tricked to make them feel they were in control but really he is a very powerful mastermind who respects others and what they can do. Overall a great character to make a multi-movie franchise with. Overall my favorite hero of the Dc Universe, where darkness is the joke and failure is not an option.""Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story.
Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions.
Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh & Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.
at last, I am a Dhoni fan but this movie is beyond fans of Dhoni or fans of cricket... For general audience this will be a movie that's not just a treat but also a complete package.""It is a light-heart old Indian comic , suitable only for the audience from Indian Sub-continent. My dear Non-Hindi speaking friends , its a good movie only if you understand Hindi . Does not make any sense for you to watch the movie dubbed in any other language ( as the comedy and timing goes well with the native language) because it is in TOP 250 list and then write a review that would be titled as ""Spoiled My day "" . No offense to anyone , everyone has their freedom to express their views like I did :)
I have seen many non-Indian friends complaining about this , thus writing this review .""Udta Punjab is a bold movie.It speaks out on an issue that's widespread and needs addressing.The story-line is very beautifully created and the journeys of the 4 characters-played by Shahid,Alia,Diljit and Kareena make for a very entertaining film. All 4 characters play their parts very well.Shahid pumps a lot of energy in his character of a pop- star addicted to drugs.Diljit as a cop gives an honest and real performance.He brings freshness to the movie and his chemistry with Kareena is joyful.Kareena is graceful in her portrayal of a doctor who treats patients of drug abuse.The real star of the movie though is Alia,who delivers a splendid performance and keeps the audience involved in her struggle.It is a different role compared to her previous films and she absolutely nails it.Her powerful acting takes the movie to another level and one is just left wondering what's in store next for this great actress.The director,writers,producers all have done a great job in making such a bold movie.Surely,one of the best movies of Bollywood.""Strangers on a Train
The perfect murder is any murder you can commit on a Sunday wearing your favourite pair of Crocs.
However, the strangers in this thriller have a different idea of an idyllic homicide.
Guy (Farley Granger) wants to leave his wife Miriam (Laura Elliott) and marry his mistress (Ruth Roman). Bruno (Robert Walker) wants his father dead. The two randomly meet on a train and agree to take care of each other's problems.
While Bruno holds up his end of the bargain, Guy backs out on his. Infuriated, Bruno goes to plant evidence at the amusement park where he strangled Miriam, unless Guy can stop him.
One of Alfred Hitchcock's most revered works, this redrafting of the 1950s bestseller remains a visual landmark to this day. Meanwhile, Raymond Chandler's hardboiled script retains its dark, relatable qualities.
Moreover, it reminds us that strangers are just friends we haven't committed murder for yet.

Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR!
I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.
Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.
I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.
Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent.
I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we will get to see a sequel!""""Apocalypse now"" is not a movie about the Vietnam war as everyone says, ""apocalypse now"" is a film that goes on during the Vietnam War, Yes, it's different. The 1970s is where Francis Ford Coppola is at the height of his creativity and genius, and in ""apocalypse now"" you notice all the noises of greatness of the director, we perceive the constant cuts and how difficult it was to make this film, but in the End was worth it. Here we have the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is agonized in ostracism about to be tried for murder when he receives a mission, travel to the extreme jungles of Cambodia to kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a man who goes crazy when he feels Power in your hands, the script sounds good, and even simple, but it has an incredible depth, thanks also to the more than three hours of movies, which at certain times even get a little boring, but at no time do you want to fidget or catch The phone, because Coppola presents us with an incredible, smoky, hot, wild and somber photograph, ""apocalypse now"" arguably has one of the best photographs I've seen in movies, along with his soundtrack that mixes classical music with pop and Very well the music scene of the 60s, with various sub intrigues, during the course of our journey we know many characters, all have their importance and show the irreverence and cruelty of this war, and the performances are great, nothing great. The weaknesses are for continuity errors not only in the script but as in the movie edition, but the film is so great that we understand it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Francis Coppola's masterpiece. Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen inspire people with their acting. The scene of the helicopter attack on the scene -this scene alone is a matter of writing- The use of Wagner's legendary Ride of the Valkyries was one of the things that impressed me the most. And of course there is the truth of Marlon Brando. The legendary player shows why he is legend, even though he is very rare in the film. The film did not humorously examine the war as in Full Metal Jacket. You can see the wickedness of the war more clearly. The only problem with the film is that the workout is too long. Sometimes people get sleepy. But none of this changes the fact that it is the best film about Vietnam. Follow my advice, watch it."*** This review may contain spoilers *** I watched this film for the first time yesterday. I knew it was about World war 2 but I didn't realize specifically which parts. Adrian Brody is amazing in this film playing the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman. It reminded me very much like Schindlers List not only because it covers the same themes and time period but also because it really made me appreciate the time in which I live. The way people got treated during that time was horrific and heartbreaking. This movie in my opinion had some very confronting scenes such as Adrian Brody's character getting brutally whipped by a German soldier and also a man getting thrown off the balcony from his wheelchair. These scenes for me were quite hard to watch. Overall though this film was good to watch. I can't imagine it would be easy to act those parts and put yourself into those situations but it was acted very well and very genuine. If you managed to watch Schindler's List then this film you will be able to relate to."This is the story of a little girl who has little to be happy about. She is part of a British imperialist family in India who are killed by stampeding elephants. She is left to fend for herself until she is collected and sent to live in England. She acts out and is very unpleasant, but is tolerated. At some point she meets a young girl who sort of takes her under her wing and puts up with her tantrums. They find that there are places everywhere to explore in the big house and the grounds. They do from time to time hear some whimpering on the other side of a wall. Their investigations reveal a crippled boy who gets his only satisfaction watching others play. This sets up the rest of the film. Mary Lennox, the little girl, suddenly has some purpose in her life and that's what drives things to the conclusion. Of course, this is one of the world's greatest children's books.""""Directed by Peter Jackson, Fellowship of the Ring, is the first film in a series of three, collectively entitled, Lord of the Rings. Based on a series of novels of the same name by famed fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings is the story of an all powerful ring and the struggle of a noble few to breaksit and its master's dark power. If you've read the books, you know just what a simplistic and dumbed down explanation that is. Lord of the Rings is much more than a bunch of furry footed creatures and wizards running about with swords and using silly medieval catch phrases. It's a journey of spirit and darkness unlike any other. Director Peter Jackson has re-created a world so full of history, detail, and affection, that it far surpasses the work of any other. The impossible dream of Tolkien fans has come true, and the beauty, majesty, and genius of Tolkien's world is at last fully realized""."I thought the movie portrayed the civil war perfectly. It showed how the African American soldiers fought for their place in the military and society. They proved themselves worthy of fighting. Overall the movie was action packed has intense scenes that made the movie goer question morality and gave them a look into what the civil war was actually like. MAtthew broderick's character was probably the best. His morality and conscience was questioned and tested through the perilous fighting and barbaric actions that took place in the civil war. Although the movie is now dated it still holds purpose in the world of movies because of its significance of showing what the war that divided this country was really like."You know when you hear other people whining about not being nominated for an Academy Award and you watch this movie, you kind of should be able to see through those other people. It's a real shame though that Idris did not get nominated and also the kid, the main star of the movie, whose giving a powerful performance.
But if you don't care about nominations and/or wins, but do care about really powerful movies, that do challenge you, you shouldn't care anyway. You should just watch this and be awed by it. It's really good and it will stay with you. It seems like an accurate look at states without real leadership. Where any party thinks they are the good guys and therefor are allowed to do what they want ... But is it that easy? And how do you get people to follow you? There are some tricks of course and you will see some depicted here ... watch but beware that this is not made for entertainment purposes only""One of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know if it's the Paris, or the protagonist's romantic fantasies, or the 20's that got me so deep in love with this movie. Opening scene with streets of Paris and jazz music are something I could watch separately over and over again. The eternal comparison of now and then, of our simple everyday life and their amazing life and work. The question we all ask ourselves, sooner or later, are we born in the wrong century? Could we be more successful and accepted in some other era? The fear that we might never be understood by people that surround us, and the comfort that we seek in words of those who battled same fears. What happens when we meet those who inspire us? Great story, great performance, beautiful picture.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It's been a few years since I've seen the film but that is unimportant as I know it like the back of my hand as I do the life and music of Mozart. The movie came first, however. The first piece that I ever played on the piano was the andante middle movement of Mozart's first piano sonata, a piece that doesn't feature in the film but the movie drove me out of my status as a musical dilettante and into the ranks of musiciansgranted, a crappy musician but a musician nonetheless. I wonder how many other viewers were so heavily influenced my Amadeus.
As good as the performances are in Amadeus (and they are all superb) the real star is the music of Mozart. For many people I am quite certain that the movie was their introduction to the greatest composer who has ever handed down music. It isn't the music alone that makes this joining of music and film so successful but the way in which we are presented with the music, the way Milos Forman deconstructs Mozart's genius for the benefit of those of us without the benefit of a lifetime of musical training. This is especially highlighted in the scene in which Salieri views the young composer's work as he reads it on the music stand (K 361 Gran Partita).
""He's taking the conventions but slightly rearranging them to produce an effect of surprise but he's not rearranging them to such an extreme extent that he loses contact with his audience and this is really, absolutely at the essence of Mozart."" This is an unattributed Quote: from a documentary on the composer which wonderfully describes his music in a single sentence. Amadeus is two hours and 40 minutes but it also precisely defines just what it is about Mozart that made him exactly what he was, is, has become, and will always be for everyone who appreciates music.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It is without doubt my favorite movie. In the 80s in the heat of the US space race and Russia, this movie made us dream of the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life, of breaking the air laws of flight and of giving a teenager the possibility of living a fascinating adventure .
When I finish this movie for the first time I was dreaming for several days that I had the possibility to live an experience like this. This film awakened in me an impressive interest in everything related to space and all its mysteries.
Today I still dream of piloting a spaceship from the hand of an alien.
Absolutely recommended.""I'm writing this review long, long after my original viewing of the film, and that's significant in itself: it's stayed with me this long.
Ben Affleck did such a good job on this movie I could hardly believe it was him directing. The gritty settings, the bang-on performances, the solid pacing... It flat WORKS just on a cinematic level. It's a good detective story with really compelling characters. Notably, Casey Affleck's performance is magnificent. Deadpan, absolutely, but it's a character that demands it.
What elevates Gone Baby Gone to true greatness, though, is the moral question posed in the course of the story. It's a great movie to see with other people, because it's sure to raise discussion.""Scientist Eddie Jessup (William Hurt) is doing experiments on himself--taking hallucinatory drugs and using an isolation tank. However it starts affecting his molecular structure and he may be regressing. His wife Emily (Blair Brown) loves him but can't get him to stop.
A REAL weird film full of trippy hallucinations and questionable science. It moves quickly and characters speak VERY fast so you're given little time to think how impossible this all is. I saw this originally in Megasound back in 1980. It was so intense I saw it three times :) This was justly nominated for Best Music and Best Sound. Brown and Hurt are great in their roles and Charles Haid is hysterical as Mason Parrish. My only complaint is the ridiculous ending. I just saw it again last night at a theatre and the audience was in hysterics laughing at the end. Still this is highly recommended.""When I watched it first time in a cinema(13 years old and it was my first Star Trek movie) I was disappointed, but now (22 years later, and after I watched it all from Star Trek universe for a several times, I think this is an excellent movie. Everything works fine with the continuity and I disagree with the reviewers that claims otherwise. I can only agree with a claim related to a destruction of a El-Aurian world by the Borg. It is not possible to get it passed almost unnoticed in the Federation and nobody recognized Borg as a threat. To make the matter worst, 80 years later Starfleet does not know nothing about their existence when Q put Enterprise in front Borg cube. The scene with crushing Enterprise to a planet is one of the Star Tek finest.""Making the most out of ones situation. But also acknowledging the talent one has and being able to stand up to people trying to take advantage of you. And all that while not being able to see. Ray is a wonderful movie, that is not afraid to go to tough places and ask tough questions. It's also not just glorifying the person/musician many loved and still love for the music he made.
No one starts from the top and especially back then, when you consider the color of the skin played a big role. While racism isn't gone and some could argue it resurfaced big again lately, this was made in a time when it seemed far away. Still Taylor Hackford is a great director and he knows how to get powerful performances out of his actors. Great story, great ups and downs and you don't even have to know much to really enjoy this human story ...""After pretty definitely dying off in the early 90's due to audience apathy and a string of borderline-flops, the slasher-film genre was revitalized thanks to master director Wes Craven's wonderful and subversive self-aware 1996 horror-comedy ""Scream."" Realizing that slasher horror could be ""hip"" and ""cool"" again with the postmodern twist that ""Scream"" added to spice-up its storyline, it quickly became in-vogue for studios and filmmakers to add a self-satirical meta angle to many new horror features released in its wake. And one of the most successful films to implement this new leaning towards comedy was certainly 1998's delightful and twisted ""Bride of Chucky""- the fourth film in the popular cult-series ""Child's Play.""
Directed by the fantastic Ronny Yu from a script by ""Child's Play"" series creator Don Mancini, ""Bride of Chucky"" might just be the best film of the entire franchise. After the somewhat disastrous third entry made seven years prior, the series sort-of imploded and there was a time where there was doubt we'd ever even see Chucky on the big screen again. Thankfully, the wait was worth it. ""Bride of Chucky"" is fantastically entertaining, and the newfound self-aware humor adds a lot to the film. By that time, audiences had wised up to the formula of the series and another bland retread would have fallen flat. By giving us such a radical and humorous departure, Mancini and Yu injected some much-need fresh blood into the ""Chucky"" experience. It was hilarious. It was unexpected. And it was exactly what Chucky needed at the time to win back audiences who had grown tired of his old antics by the time the third film had rolled out.
Jennifer Tilly stars as Tiffany, the former lover of the infamous ""Lakeshore Strangler"" Charles Lee Ray- who had transferred his soul into a children's doll known as Chucky. (Voiced by Brad Dourif) Longing to be reunited with her lost love, she manages to get her hands on the mangled corpse of Chucky and re-assembles him, bringing him back to life with a copy of ""Voodoo for Dummies."" While their reunion goes well at first, Tiffany finds herself crestfallen when she learns that Chucky never intended to marry her, and she betrays him by locking him in a playpen. Escaping, Chucky murders his former flame and transfers her soul into a female doll in a twisted bid for vengeance. Now, the angry couple must figure out a way to get their souls into new human hosts once and for all... and they have their eyes set on Tiffany's trailer-park neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade. (A pre-fame Katherine Heigl)
The fun of the film really lays in the shockingly sweet (in a twisted way) romance of Chucky and Tiffany. It's almost a demented parody of romantic comedies, and they have absolutely remarkable chemistry together. Dourif as always is a blast as Chucky, and it's a ton of fun seeing him saddled with a romantic interest in Tilly's Tiffany, as they repeatedly get on each-other's nerves, but also do have some genuinely cute moments together. It adds a lot of flavor and character to the proceedings seeing them bonding over butchering innocent victims. Stabile and Heigl are also a lot of fun as our somewhat hapless protagonists (who find themselves blamed for the murders committed by the demonic dolls), and there's also a really fun supporting performance by the late and great John Ritter as Jade's strict police-chief uncle who raised her in an oppressive environment. The cast is just a blast.
Mancini's script is tight, concise and never fails do deliver laughs with each scene. He also throws in the occasional shock and scare to keep horror fans happy. I've always admired how daring Mancini is with his characters, and he's never afraid to take a risk with the material, whether it works (as it does here) or not. (""Seed of Chucky"" being a good example of him going a bit too far.) Ronny Yu is a really great visual artist, and his completely insane sensibilities perfectly compliment the material, as he relishes in delivering gags and gore by the boat-load. I also really admired the musical score by the talented composer Graeme Revell, who had previously delivered a Gothic and operatic score in the series' second installment. Revell's music this time around is a bit more subdued, but works perfectly for the devilish romance between our murderous leads, and I think it's among his best work.
There's really not much I can say to the detriment of ""Bride of Chucky"", besides some minor nitpicks I had with a few of the scares and kills. It's just a fun, entertaining and often strangely adorable film, and I think it still stands tall as one of the best of the series. It might not have been the film that fans were expecting when they found out Chucky was coming back for a fourth installment... but it was the film the series needed at the time to reinvigorate audience interest and evolve as a legitimate franchise.
As a horror fan, I have to give ""Bride of Chucky"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am voting for 8 out of 10, not because of the plot, the actors, the idea behind the movie or the dialogues, but because of the ending. Until the very last minute I was neither disappointed nor satisfied with the movie, but when I figured out what Lee Weathers really was, I was stunned. Seconds ago I had considered her unnatural actions (like killing Skip Vronsky) a negative point, and I am a little surprised that I did not see that twist about Lee's nature coming. It makes sense though, and explains many aspects of the movie that might have been debatable until then, for example Dr. Lui Cheng asking Lee whether they met before which Lee denies.
I have to admit that I still was utterly surprised discovering the fact that Lee herself (or itself, considering her resistance against assigning a gender to Morgan) was not entirely human. I did not see it coming and it was presented very well. The timing of Lee turning her hands and the dialogue of the executives of the company was excellent.
Morgan is not one of the best movies I have seen (not even close), but it managed to surprise me in an unexpected moment.""I should start saying that I never write reviews, to be honest I never have written a review until now. So, you must be wondering ""why are you writing this review for that particular movie?"", my answer is simple. The Man from Earth isn't the best movie I ever seen,though is the kind of movie that really makes you think. The most powerful weapon present in this movies is its storytelling, which flows in such a way that one can't avert their gaze. I don't know about you, but this movie made me curious about a lot of things, things which I'm definitely going to check out, and that is the best thing I could get from a work of fiction.""Reviewers Notes;
1. As I write this, the top-rated IMDb review starts with the header ""a hard movie to explain..."" and that pretty much nails it. The film starts very slow, builds gradually, has the viewer hooked like a fish by the mid-point, and then falls a tiny bit short in the climax. But overall the experience is unforgettable, magical, and great fun.
2. In Japan anime, they revere not only their movies but their studios. It was always considered that the NA studios, even Pixar, don't measure up. But Studio Laiko in this amazing film has done things with stop-motion and color which make it a world standard and as good as or better than the best that Japan has to offer. I am even going to use some frames a screen saver, they are THAT good.
3. Lots of great voice acting but Charlize Theron steals, literally steals, the film and takes it to a new level. Makes you forget all about the goldfish that initially started the trend in ""star"" voices. Truly an incredible performance.""Wow, I'm surprised there were not awards won. The most gripping and suspenseful story to date in this amazing franchise. The characters were perfectly cast, truly amazing CGI and stunts makes for an unforgettable 90 minutes ever. I could possibly watch this movie over and over again. It really reminds me of the lord of the rings franchise, minus the long walks which is replaced with sharp second to second action. It really was a coming of age movie, it came at a time of my life where I needed hope in my life. Thankfully it was here when I needed it and it fully cured my phobia of zombies or as others say, the undead. Hopefully they will continue to make at least 5 more movies. Do yourself a favour, buy this title.""This film begins with the famous Gandhi Quote: ""An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind"".
In 1993, a series of 12 bombs went off during Ramadan all over Mumbai (Bombay) which killed 257 people (thought the film often says it's 300 plus). This film is about this event as well as the subsequent police investigation of it. It's all based on true events but is rather critical of the police, and as a result the film was banned in India for two years before the government eventually allowed its release. I don't think it was banned just because the police used torture in this film, as it's actually relatively common to see the police doing this in the Indian films I've previously watched. Other factors which probably contributed to this ban was the film's implicating Pakistan in the crimes as well as inferring that the way the police handled riots in December 1992 and January 1993 led to the bombings.
The film begins with a man under arrest pleading for the police to believe him that a group was planning on burning the Mumbai Stock Exchange. Foolishly, the police just dismiss this and soon you see bombs detonating all over the city. All this occurs in the first few minutes of the film and what follows is a step by step documentary style investigation. How the police captured and interrogated suspects (and tortured them in some), how the mastermind of the bombings abandoned his minions and how the events are all in context, as this springs from previous attacks in which hundreds of Muslims were murdered--and this makes the Quote: from Gandhi at the beginning of the film quite appropriate.
Overall, this is a very hard film to watch in places (such as the scene where the police use a hammer on one suspect's hand) but is also very well made and unflinching. And, unlike a typical Bollywood film, it lacks the song and dance numbers and just concentrates on telling the story.
By the way, I did some checking and as of today, one ringleader was arrested and sentenced to death (he was executed two years ago). Two main ringleaders are still being sought by the Indian government.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie's plot, scenes and events in the movie were very exciting and kept my attention the whole
The story told the events of the Union side when adding in a black regiment and kept it pretty accurate from a historical standpoint, possible one of the most realistic civil war movie (which there is not a lot of civil war movies since most war movies focus on WW2)
Really captures the prejudice they faced on the Union side and focuses on what the characters are going through rather not just the battle itself.
A good watch for anyone interested in a good, historical movie""*** This review may contain spoilers *** THE STING is a fine 1930s-set comedy adventure film re-teaming Paul Newman and Robert Redford after the runaway success of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. I found it more enjoyable than their previous outing thanks to the intense storyline, which is set in the world of gangsters and gambling and features oodles of suspense and tension as the two men attempt to pull off one of the biggest scams in history.
The thing that becomes quickly apparent when watching THE STING is just how well written it is. The script is very clever without being obnoxiously so and the involving opening set-piece is a fine example of this. Newman plays in support here and has less screen time than I expected, but the film belongs to Redford anyway and he's a delight, the best I've seen him. The third player in the thing is Robert Shaw, who brings level of quiet intensity to the picture that makes his character even more imposing than the famous henchman role he essayed in FROM Russia WITH LOVE.
Although THE STING has a long running time, not a moment of it feels slow or boring. Instead it keeps moving through interesting set-pieces, mainly focused on gambling (which is a fascinating cinematic subject matter in the right hands) but also including a number of decent foot chases too. Everything builds to a classic climax that rounds off an excellent film overall.""What a breath of fresh air in these dark times! Hidden Figures is an amazing, uplifting, inspiring story focusing on the successes of three African-American women whose mathematical and computer-science skills directly helped NASA launch astronauts into space (and back) and eventually to the moon.
The bulk of the events depicted are from 1961 at the Langley Research Center and Project Mercury. If you had asked me ""When did NASA desegregate?"" I would have been stumped, because I never knew NASA was segregated. The movie gives a palpable sense of the raw frustration and pain caused by senseless discrimination, and it does so so simply by facing us with the harsh reality and indignity of having to walk over a mile each day just to use the bathroom. The women entrusted to make critical astronomical calculations couldn't even be trusted to share the same space for a minute or two in what is one of the most common, natural, and inherent aspects of humanity.
And it's a double-whammy: they're black, and they're women. Hidden Figures is just as much, if not more so, about sexism and exposing the baseless belief that women either should not or cannot excel at science. There's a great satisfaction when the Director of the Space Task Group literally sledge-hammers the bathroom signs down, ending a practice that never should have started.
Do yourself a favor and catch Hidden Figures on the big screen, see it with a big crowd, and feel a sense of humanity trickling back in.""""Manchester by the Sea"" takes place in the dead of winter in the small Massachusetts coastal town of the title. This bleak setting and the stark, grim imagery that accompany it set the tone for Kenneth Lonergan's third feature film, which explores grief and our darkest demons in a way so authentic it can get uncomfortable at times. Yet its that same level of honesty that gives the film an unexpected sense of humor, a kind of tranquility and a quiet hope.
Casey Affleck gives a career-elevating performance as Lee Chandler, a stoic loner living as a residence building janitor in Boston who gets a call that his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler) is in critical condition. By the time he gets up north to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Joe has died, leaving Lee to look after his 16-year-old nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), and bury his brother, all while fending off painful memories of his past that this town evokes.
Although it would seem that ""Manchester by the Sea"" focuses on the grief at hand  a man mourning his brother and a son mourning his father  the film is actually about other challenges and traumas that Joe's death brings to the surface for these characters. That's what makes Lonergan's story and script so masterful  the present day action is only maybe a quarter of the story. What's happening beneath the surface in any given scene is everything else.
Lonergan cues us in by splicing in scenes from the past that powerfully inform the present action. As a director and editor, he inserts them rather abruptly and without the sometimes patronizing cues that most filmmakers use to indicate the arrival of a flashback sequence. The transitions are instead rather jarring and require some work on our behalf to sort out, but this echoes the jarring way they interrupt Lee's consciousness as well. Lonergan puts us completely in sync with Lee, setting up Affleck to have tremendous success.
Affleck does not miss his opportunity. His performance is understated, brooding and cold, punctuated by a few brief gun shots of emotion. This is not a traditional Oscar bait performance, though much of that thanks can again go to Lonergan for writing the audiences into Lee's skin, affording Affleck a great deal of nuance to work with. It's also in his character's nature to suppress emotion, to stay reserved, and watching an actor push back on emotion proves just as powerful as watching it pour out of them.
That's what makes Michelle Williams' performance as Lee's ex-wife such a significant complement. Williams gets pretty minimal screen time, but when she does, it's in her character's nature to open up the flood gates. An encounter between the two characters is the emotional climax of the film for this reason.
Other supporting characters also provide alternative perspectives on Lee's struggles, another part of what makes Lonergan's script so outstanding. The most complex dynamic is between Lee and Patrick, the teenager who wants more than anything to keep his life intact: being on the hockey team, playing lead guitar in a rock band and having not one, but two girlfriends. He does have his own struggles beyond needing closure from his dad's death, but it's how his life is affected by the adults, namely Lee, struggling around him that raise the most interesting points. Hedges provides a lot of comic relief, surprisingly, but he brings a lot of maturity to Patrick that helps elevate his relationship with Lee to something beyond the angsty teen and the bachelor uncle that doesn't want to have to deal with him.
""Manchester by the Sea"" has some powerful messages, messages that can be hard to hear, especially in the form of a movie that's nearly 140 minutes long and full of nothing but cold, dark imagery to the point that some viewers might walk away with Seasonal Affective Disorder. Yet these are the kind of messages that we need to be reminded of, even at the movies. Grief  overcoming the darkest moments that have defined our lives, is not easy. That honesty makes Lonergan's film one of the most important, albeit one of the hardest, movies of the year

Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more""Once in a while there is a film that shows some courage to tell events of a true story ... Oliver Stone, is a director who continues to highlight the injustice of the American government and the lengths it goes to. Snowden is a hero and will be remembered as such, when those who tried to tarnish him for speaking the truth, will have their legacy crumble.
The man is a hero.
I recently watched ""American Sniper"" and was blown away by the 'patriotism' bullshit propaganda that was almost on par with the the nazi propaganda scenes from Tarantino's ""Inglorious Bastards"".
This however, is relevant, important to us all ... and above all ... continues to happen, without our permission or knowledge.
I urge people to watch the film.""I watched The Great Wall in IMAX with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in Crystal clear images, projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with the powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!
If you are the person dying to watch the same old Rogue Story or a new story of hobbits like Fantastic Beasts...just don't go. But if you really want something refreshing without the prequel/sequel tag and you don't have any problem seeing Chinese people sharing their presence on the silver screen, this movie is especially for you. You won't get disappointed at all.
Damon and Pascal were very fun to watch. For Tian Jing, she was glowing. She justified her role. I also feel like planting my lips on her! 😘
No offense though!😂""I wasn't sure what to expect. It had been a long time since I saw the original - 20 years. I watched the original again to remind myself before going. I'm glad I did as although there are flashbacks in T2 I think you need to be very familiar with the original to get it.
I was worried they would be treading old ground or it just wouldn't live up to the reputation of the original. How could it? the original was so groundbreaking, so repellent yet enthralling, so hard to watch yet hard to look away. So genre defining.
I needn't have worried. This sequel is fantastic. The main characters are played very well. Its great to see them all again - like seeing old friends. Spud is my favourite. Its there's any fairness in the world Ewan Bremner will get a supporting actor nomination - hes great.
This film doesn't shock in the same way as the original - but it doesn't try to shock for the sake of it. Its full of humour - its really quite funny. There was lots of laughter in the cinema.
Its well made. Fast paced. Heart warming. Great story line - though really quite simple.
I left the cinema feeling uplifted.
I haven't read the novel this is based on so can't comment on that - but as a film - it works really well.""Best Ensemble Winner in SAG Awards 2017 is the prove that this movie offers something
IMHO Hidden Figures is the 2016 version of The Help, so if you love The Help, you will end up liking this movie too.. It is the story of 3 brilliant negro women who helps America launches their first rocket orbiting the earth.. diversity and racism issue are the spices that made the movie more and more interesting with some memorable and hilarious Quote: s such as ""Here at NASA we all pee the same color""
Taraji P. Henson lead the cast with a strong performance as Katherine Johnson, unfortunately this year's Best Actress race is so crowded that made her performance looks decent than other actresses.. Octavia Spencer gave her typical performance just like the one that won her an Oscar in The Help, so cheers for another nomination for this movie.. But the real gems for me is Janelle Monae in this movie, if her character could be explore much further, I believe she can do more
Overall, its a really good drama.. Like I said before, if you like The Help then you will end up liking this movie also
Rating : 4 / 5 stars""Before I saw this film, I was baffled by how polarizing the user reviews were. Tens and ones, but very few in between. After seeing the film, I absolutely get it. Start by asking yourself if you enjoy the following movies. Sphere(1998). 2001: A Space Odyssey. Solaris(2002). If your answer is no to any of these, particularly those last two, do yourself a favor and watch something else. It would be insulting to call this the thinking person's movie, because I can think of a number of highly intelligent people that would not like this movie at all. It would be closer to say it is the extremely patient, thinking person's movie. The pacing reminded me of 2001, though it is not quite that slow. There is very nearly zero action in it, but a whole lot of highly thought provoking concepts that build over the course of the movie. For myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I also understand the hate if you went and saw it, expecting something like Independence Day. In this movie, the battlefield takes place in the mind, and the heroes are the linguists and the mathematicians.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Hidden Figures is a movie filmed in 2016, in US, directed by (to me unknown) Theodore Melfi. With the main characters of Katherine G. Johnson (by Taraji P. Henson ), Dorothy Vaughan (by Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (by Janelle Monáe), Al Harrison (by Kevin Costner) and Vivian Mitchell (by Kirsten Dunst). It is an encouraging story about NASA colored employees back in '60, straggling between the pressure of segregation in Virginia and uncompromising first man in space race between US and CCCP. It starts with three black ladies trying to repair a car by the road each helping their own way, eventually harassed by a cop passing by on patrol car and then ending up escorting them to Langley as per the importance of the space mission they were working for. Then Kevin Costner enters the scene and right away I started to feel at my cinematography home. He is so confident and transmitting such an authority, it makes me feel just as so. I'm not going further into story line however let me share with you some of very encouraging moments (at least for me):
I like very much the Where the hell have you been"" scene. Actress Taraji P. Henson was just amazing how she expressed the pushed in the corner"" justified outburst. It came just about the right moment. I was starting to think to myself When the hell is she going to get p i s s e d off?"" and then relieve came over to me. Finally! Finally she got it out of herself. And they all listened. Even Jim Parson (Big Bang Theory) unpleasant as ever with a constant shine of prejudice in his eye ball. Before that scene the whole atmosphere was fake happy. After? Sincerity, openness freed up.
Another goose bumps scene, when Taraji P. Henson made her calculations at the top secret briefing room full of white men. Kevin Costner standing up was a nice touch.
Yet another emotional crescendo scene. Colored ladies department reassigned to handle the IBM beast machine. Things are moving forward while finally the white man understands which was very nicely portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. That gradual improvement of her respect to colored colleagues.
As well as Janelle Monáe attending fearlessly her first class in all white High School to gain entitlement become the first colored engineer working for NASA. Very nice touch the way she convinced Judge to get an enrollment. I wish everybody (including myself) would have such a desire for education to face all that difficulties.
There was a nice and well chosen music, like for example Miles Davis's So What tune was very fit for the first successful launch, Ray Charles etc. I liked the camera work as well. I'm not an expert, however the camera was nice and steady, not disturbing, shaky.
Perhaps, the only odd thing about this movie was that the atmosphere of '60 was not supported by a very simple fact of life, such as smoking. Nobody smoked in the movie and that is really strange considering the movie situated back in '60 when people smoked everywhere. There is not even a hint of smoking in the movie. Who knows why?
Summa s u m m a r u m it was a good quality movie with a message. I don't really care whether or not this movie is a propaganda or a racist historical revisionism. I'm only trying to see what this movie could give you: entertainment, nice and encouraging story, lesson to life. There is a clear message: don't underestimate people by their status. I'm very gladly confirming the current 8/10 ratings. Thank you.""This was one of the few truly great movies of 2016. This movie was even better than the highly predictable Manchester by the Sea.
Being a box office sleeper this movie will not get the recognition it deserves. Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges gave outstanding performances. I fear however that tripe such as LaLa land will steal the Acadamy awards.
The story was great, the performances were great, the music was terrific, the photography was good, AND the characters were so believable that you will be able to empathize with both the good and bad guys alike.
This movie presented itself as a ""modern day"" western complete with lawmen, Indians, bandits, bank robberies, and a posse. What is not to like.""A must-watch. In the backdrop of 1960s USA when the country was trying to catch up with the Soviets in space, Hidden Figures brings to light the stories of three black women who make their mark in a white-male dominated NASA.
Story (9/10): Hidden Figures talks about the struggles of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson to make their mark in the world's most respected space organization. As US battles USSR in the race to send the first human in space, there is an internal battle that NASA witnesses against racism+sexism. While the rest of the country is obviously divided between whites and colored, surprisingly, a very scientific organization like NASA is also not very different with colored toilets, colored coffee mugs, and colored buildings - just like in general public life where pretty much everything under the sun had a segregation. It is this discrimination that is stopping the US from achieving the full potential of their human talent - leaving untapped the geniuses in the black community. However, sense prevails eventually as these three ladies stubbornly place their foot through the doors of critical operations in NASA and through persistence, make their way through the white+male dominated work environment. They face their own share of struggles but they never give up and place their work above their egos, which sets them apart from the rest of the crowd. Diving into their personal lives where they interact with other fellow blacks, the conversations conveyed the difference in their perspective and approach towards fighting the segregated society very well. The good part about the story is that they have focused more on building positive characters than negative, which makes it a very ""feel good"" movie as you watch it. However, the best message of the story is that you can only fight oppression by hard work, smart thinking, and persistence - not violence and hatred.
Acting (9/10): Taraji Henson (playing Katherine), Octavia Spencer (playing Dorothy) and Janelle Monae (playing Mary) are brilliant in their roles. What I loved was the different shades given to the character of each lady, which may or may not be true in their real life. While Katherine is sincere and hard working, Dorothy is mature and very smart and Mary is playful but passionate about her work. These are the kind of roles that gets sketches into the minds for a very long time and these three ladies scored a perfect home run here. Jim Parsons was distinctively noticeable due to his BBT legacy and did well on a larger screen. The role was pretty much in his comfort zone. However, if the director imagined him in a negative shade in the movie, that didn't come out well. The rest of the supporting cast was good with their limited screen time.
Direction (10/10): Theodore Melfi's direction of the movie is great. From Scene 1 itself, he made it clear that this is not going to be a soap opera of oppression but a ""feel good"" story of how intelligence prevails over emotions. The character sketch of the three protagonists was very well thought and it brought the much-needed variety in the story. The brilliant execution of the story ensured that audience attention wasn't lost even for a moment. The mild humor on right occasions added good flavor to the overall movie. On the serious side, the depiction of Dorothy, Mary and Katherine's struggles against racial and gender discrimination is done beautifully. Theodore very intelligently used the part of the protagonists' personal lives to convey from where their strengths come and communicate their perspective to life.
Overall (9/10): Overall, the movie is very well made and must watch. If you grew up in that era, it will be like reliving the old days. If you weren't, you would get a glimpse of life in those days of segregation.""Silence, Martin Scorsese's long-in-the-works adaptation of Shūsaku Endō's same-titled novel about a Jesuit priest searching for his former mentor in shogun-era Japan, is a truly religious piece of filmmaking, in that it looks for meaning in the contradictions and absurdities of faith, instead of its assurances. Filmed in Taiwan, it limits its view of 17th-century Japanese life to far-flung villages, tiny huts, and walled compounds, effectively alternating agoraphobic and claustrophobic perspectives. Like The Last Temptation of Christ, Silence clashes the spiritual and the practical, the human and the divine. With the dialogue concentrated on the mysteries of faith and how Rodrigues' rigid insistence on God's existence might be its own form of self-deluded arrogance. Silence is an esoteric undertaking that appeals more to the head than the heart. Some may find Silence's agonised self-flagellation far too ponderous and tortured. But Ferreira's appearance elevates the movie beyond matters of Christian doctrine to universal questions about how society should best confront all forms of intolerance. A slow-burn tale filled with beautiful imagery and understated performances, its elegance yields Scorsese's one of the most subtle efforts.
My Rating :4/5""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Like in a typical Marvel Movie, this one has many instruments in it.
Fun, enemy emergence, intelligence, humor, fun, Western-like entrances, fun again, plot twists, enemy confrontation, lots of fight, fun, cars exploding, planes / helicopters crashing, funny dialogues, good guys differing on the subject, enemy reaching out for the purpose, good guys feeling emotional towards each other, less fun, the enemy is to be defeated, good guys feel heart-broken and go on their separate ways... oh a little fun at the end, too.
Wait, don't forget to check for the last scene after the credits!.. Wow, that was close!..
So, it was all carefully put together so that we remember what had happened since the very first movie. Therefore, we are ready for this...
First of all, Steve Rogers is a man not many nations nor countries can understand to the fullest. He has higher values any institutions in the USA can provide in the 21st century. Because, as we all know, the capitalism and the pragmatism were closing in on each other and did combine in the 20th century, and the results including the ""rightful ones"" seem to undermine the rights of the ""little guys.""
For instance, if a ""hero"" is to die, it is better for these two ""values"" that a hundred people die to save this hero than the death of the hero.
But, to Steve Rogers, it is more simple than interest related. How is that so?.. He thinks that no one is more important than another, save the heroes not.
If there is an interest in a fight, he will only uphold the truth. Okay, okay. It seemed exaggerated! So, he tried to stop Tony Stark by saying Bucky is his friend. But the reason he kept standing beside the Winter Soldier is because the Winter Soldier was used against his will. Yes, even in the dark side, it is up to the ""will to power"" to be truly dark...
On the other hand, Tony Stark is a man of ego. Hey, this is hard to say, too. By the way, he fights for the truth and good of the people; but if the things get complicated, he is easily distracted and blindfolded to the truth.
More to it is that he won't stop until he ""succeeds"" in doing the ""right thing"". But, it nearly always emanates from his own ego... Sad.
The other guys / heroes that gather around either one of them are soldiers rather than commanders. No, they are friends. And friends can be half-blind to the truth... Therefore they all do feel that they follow the right side.
Okay, verily, no one is saying that one of both sides is 100 percent the ""right side"". All are human, so is to err. But, Steve Rogers' way seems more humane. He cares for everyone; not just the well being of the USA.
Overall, the actions scenes are easy to follow. Good.
All acting is good. But Mr. Chris Evans and Mr. Robert Downey Jr. do a great job together. They are the stars of this one. Good!..
The dialogues are well-measured.
The soundtracks are okay.
The son who goes straight to the dark side broke the pattern and thought again about what to do. Good.
No hero / person killed another person willingly. Oh, this is an understatement. I accept that. But, you see, I was raised by the capitalism and pragmatism... So, I go by the big numbers, too. (No, I don't.)
At last, we can say that it will be interesting to see the quarrel suppurate in the next movie.
The new Spider-man seems very likable. I hope he will be the best in decades!..
""And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them. And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other, fight ye that which doeth wrong until it return unto the ordinance of Allah; then, if it return, make peace between them justly, and act equitably. Verily! Allah loveth the equitable.""
---The Gracious Koran, the 9th Verse in the 49th Chapter (called The Twellings)---""Pays to seize the upper-hand and have persistence, determination, and balls! The two McDonald brothers were hard working, honest, and ethical. Those three skills are not exactly a formula for financial success. ""The Founder"", a story about Americana. After seeing interviews, I was prepared to see a real hood-winking! What I saw was a man of the 50's, chasing the American Dream, the best way he knew how. During the 50' & 60's, people who set goals of being financially successful, were ""students"" of Dale Carnegie and/or Norman Vincent Peale's ""Power of Positive Thinking, driven by persistence and determination. I have to say, MICHAEL KEATON has become my favorite actor of the 21st century! He's even endearing as the ""bad guy"". Exiting the theater, I over-heard some women commenting the despicable actions, by their standards, of Ray Kroc. The ""handshake"" that was never honored was unethical and I'm not sure why he wouldn't have been more reasonable or fair, but other than that, I could support his ideas and drive. Given how hard he had worked, for so long, I admired his brilliance!""I don't know what kind of drugs all you people are on, but you need to switch dealers. This movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time. I don't care for most of the ""super hero"" movies, but this one was really good. Ya know, you can only do so many Batman movies before it's, been there, done that. I'm glad Superman is dead, that crap was old 20 years ago. If you wanna see those type of movies, go watch one of the 50 that's already out there. And Jared Leto whining about most of his Joker scenes getting cut...Good! That's another character that's been beat into the ground. And sorry bud, the only good Joker was Jack Nicholson. To all you people whining about how bad the movie was...Grow up and get a life. It was good and you know it.""This film gives us a set of characters that I never knew existed. They were women involved as ""computers"" during the early days of the space program. We get to know each of them a bit. Unfortunately, they are defined a bit too much by their work. It would have been interesting to get into more of the day to day pressures they experienced when they were not at NASA. With that said, it still is interesting to see what went on and how they strove for dignity and acceptance in the face of racial prejudice. Of course, NASA was (is) in the South, so hanging over everything are all the things that those who simply lived normal lives had to deal with. I understand that the whole thing with running to the bathroom was fiction. But it made a point. The writing on the blackboard and standing on a ladder is visual, but it was more likely done in notebooks or on pieces of paper. Did an entire group of these women march into the IBM computer room and take over? Probably not en masse. But I gave it a nine because it was a hallmark in showing us what these ladies, who were every bit as competent as their white counterparts, had to do to get respect. The movie is touching and exciting. I was pleased to see the events surrounding John Glenn's historic flight. I remember as a high school kid, how much we feared for his fate. The performers are quite delightful in their own ways. I thought the relationships with the husbands and husbands to be were a bit too contrived, but that's fine. We weren't there. See this movie.""This was an amazing movie and tugged on the heartstrings of everyone who saw it. No doubt the low score on the site can be attributed to the protesters who most likely didn't even see the movie. I ranked it as high as possible to bring up the average because in all honesty, this is by far the best animal movie ever.
The plot is simple enough for younger audience members to follow, and although there are some sad parts, they don't last for long. The plot is also intricate enough to relate to adults as well. The narration is superb and there is comic relief to bring up the mood. The film also includes scenes from the dog's point of view, which is extremely well done. The score was excellent and really helped convey the themes of each scene.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When you watch this movie, you can't help think of all the people in the world that try to stop others from just being happy and being themselves. The film is historical, of course, documenting the factual story of the ridiculous racism in the South, but it's not overwrought with the negativity. It simply shows a couple in love, raising a family, while others in ""power"" try to prevent them from doing so. Love is love, and who is anyone to try to tell someone else who they can love and who they cannot? It's hard to believe this situation still existed 50 years ago in the U.S., but when you see the headlines today from certain states in this country, maybe it isn't surprising. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga are excellent in their roles, and you realize that this isn't about law, logic or sanity. It's simply about love, and the appropriate last name on the court case (and the film) makes it all the more poignant. The film has some pacing issues, especially in the beginning, but overall, it's an excellent story that reminds us all Americans eventually do the right thing, even if a stubborn minority of them fight progress all the way to the bitter end.""Disney does it again. Another follow-your-dreams story featuring a protagonist resisting the voice of society, discovering who she is, and otherwise inspiring young audiences to do the same: to follow their dreams, to go after their ideals and desires, no matter the obstacle. For if you don't give up, and trust in your friends, you will surely succeed.
Judy Hopps is a rabbit who aspires to be a policewoman, despite her parents' fear of the bigger, more predator-filled world out there in Zootopia and the absence of rabbit policemen. Unlike other Disney films, however, rather than end with the dream/identity being fulfilled, Zootopia goes beyond that and thrusts Judy into reality. Of course, being Disney, you know the good guys will triumph and everyone will be happy in the end and the bad guy turns out to be someone you've already met, you know, the usual stuff, BUT STILL, I like how Judy's dream of becoming a policewoman doesn't end there, and the plot entails a touching friendship and a message of social equality rather than the mere dream archetype. The utopia of Zootopia turns out to be darker in hue than Judy ever imagined.
Zootopia is a land of mammals, predator and prey, who coexist and live as civilized beings. They're basically human but in animal form, and Disney brilliantly illustrates such a setting according to each animal's natural characteristics -- like how the streets run with multiple sizes of cars for, say, lemmings and tigers, or how the city is made up of districts for each habitat, etc. Another significant difference between Zootopia and previous Disney films is the incorporation of modern technology, such as smartphones. Watching Zootopia, you really feel like you're watching humans, just humans who look like animals on the outside. But they're human. Long ago, when the docile denizens of Zootopia were like the animals of our world -- that is, members of a natural food chain -- they decided to unite, and become civilized. In the same way, we humans have advanced in civilization and our ideals of toleration. As time passes, more and more do we see unyielding support for civil rights, first blacks, then women, now LGBT. As fellow human beings and fellow social animals, it is in our innate capacity to love and tolerate.
And being Disney, the soundtrack and songs are amazing and catchy; the puns and references to popular culture are prevalent and hilarious; and the characters are well-developed and memorable. In addition, Zootopia astounded me with the quality of its animation. The studio has certainly improved since the days of Snow White.
Like the featured song, ""Try Everything,"" when you fall, you can get up and try again. Our world may not be a utopia. In fact, it is far from one. But there is beauty and wonder still, and hope, and friendship, and love. Why not give it your all?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Zootropolis was a little dull and I avoided animated titles for a while. I didn't hold up much hope that Sing would be anything other than a hyped up title which offers a sedate movie experience. I was wrong and I am pleasantly surprised at how good Sing actually is. The soundtrack is phenomenal and the characters are very well put together. The main character of Moon is just right, balancing raw ambition with generally being a nice guy. The bears were brilliant but the best part of the movie is at the end when the characters perform their chosen songs. It was witty, funny and filled with real ""buzz"" moments. The rendition of Rocket Man was superb. Take your kids to see this one on the big screen. You'll be just as drawn into this great movie as they are.""As you're watching some movies you just know that you love them, and conversely some movies you just know that you despise them. Then there are films like 'Collateral Beauty' which can have you stumped as to your true feelings about them. It wasn't until the final five minutes of the film that I actually worked out I liked it. There was a reason for that though. At about the halfway point in the film you work out that the ending is going to be absolutely crucial to how you feel about the film. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply say that this could not afford to have a standard ""Hollywood"" type ending. In some ways it was, but overall it was different and unique enough to make the whole thing work.
There's nothing conventional about 'Collateral Beauty'. The story is told in an almost bizarre way at times, and I think this is a large reason why some people are being tricked into thinking they didn't enjoy it. It's also a very depressing film in its tone. There's a lot of very sad and impactful scenes that you need to brace yourself for.
There's obviously an all-star cast lined up for this one. Will Smith in the lead role thoroughly impressed me. We learnt even as far back as a particular episode of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' that he had impressive acting range. He still has it to this day and will get his much cherished Oscar one day I suspect. The one who disappointed me though was Edward Norton. Not in terms of his performance, but in his choice of role. He's so much better than what he was given to work with here. In the right role he's one of the finest actors ever to work in the industry. This was certainly not one of those roles.
'Collateral Beauty' really surprised me in terms of how much I enjoy it. There are certain ""cheesy"" elements to it if you want to look at them that way, but to do so would be a negative way of perceiving things in my opinion. I think the thing I liked most about the entire film though was that it made no apologies, because life makes no apologies. It may not be to everyone's liking, but I think it will certainly be enjoyed by more people than the critics are suggesting.""Verdict: an absolute ""Must See"" for the sheer impact of Hrithik Roshan's groundbreaking performance and an emotionally compelling story, very well told.
The story IS very simple.
A man, Rohan Bhatnagar (Hrithik Roshan) and woman, Supriya Sharma (Yami Gautam) meet, fall in love, and marry. Each has been blind since birth. Despite this, each has been living and working independently  she as the pianist for a dance studio, he making good money as a professional dubbing artist for film and television. (Some of the most light-hearted moments in the movie are watching Mr Roshan physically manipulate his face, nose, and throat to produce the range of voices needed.) But Supriya gives up her job after marriage and stays home during the day while Rohan is away at the dubbing studio. Thus she is alone and without aid when a tragedy is perpetrated upon her by the local 'bad apple', Amit, and his lifelong party pal, Wasim. Amit, we discover, is the spoiled younger brother of a powerful politician who shamelessly ""owns"" the police and pays them to cover up Amit's misdeeds. Rohan & Supriya's struggle to obtain justice despite corrupt cops and the even more corrupt politician thus forms the crux of what happens.
What makes ""Kaabil"" (English: ""capable"") so emotionally satisfying is how the characters and their journey are presented in such a natural way  despite being 'differently abled'  that the audience completely identify with each of the two AND their subsequent choices/actions from the very outset of the film: they feel like people we might know and care about in our own daily lives, so we invest our emotions in their fate.
Hrithik Roshan ...
Mr Roshan has always been unique, even from his début film itself, in his unsurpassed ability to completely 'invest' in each character he portrays and make each performance distinct: each walks, talks, looks, and even moves differently from every other. Thus, the unprecedented range of characters he has successfully embodied on screen. This tremendous range has enabled Mr Roshan to shine where other actors fail in portraying roles where the character is 'differently abled': first in ""Koi ... Mil Gaya"" (2003) as a brain-damaged adult with the mind and innocence of a child, then later as a quadriplegic former magician, in ""Guzaarish"" (2010). But with ""Kaabil"", Mr Roshan has outdone even himself.
As Rohan Bhatnagar in ""Kaabil"", Hrithik Roshan is not here playing any kind of superhero nor saving the world, but just playing a simple ordinary guy  (well, as 'ordinary' as that impeccably perfect bone structure will allow, which actually becomes a quip in ""Kaabil""; the neighbourhood bad guy harasses Rohan with the nickname ""Handsome"" to play on the character having never seen even his own face)  who just happens to be blind. And there are no acting 'cheats' here. No dark glasses to hide his eyes. No contact lenses to obscure his normal vision. Mr Roshan plays the blind Rohan completely eyes-wide-open  unfocused gaze, yes, but absolutely natural. The sheer subtlety and power of this portrayal! Never, at any point, do you not believe that Rohan Bhatnagar is completely blind. Mr Roshan establishes the ""capabilities"" of the character so well from the git-go that by the time we get to the action sequences even those, too, seem completely reasonable and accepted.
I understand, now, why critics and audiences have been lauding Mr Roshan's ""Kaabil"" performance as (yet another!) career best. I would not argue with those who have even hailed this as one of THE very finest acting performances in cinema, period.
His female counterpart, petite beauty Yami Gautam as Supriya, meshes seamlessly. She will touch your heart! Do not be surprised if her ""Kaabil"" performance propels this previously underrated actress straight to the ""A""-List of Hindi film actresses.
Ronit Roy and his real-life brother Rohit Roy make the most of this opportunity to appear together on-screen for the first time, as the power-justifies-anything politician Madhavrao Shellar and his care-for-nothing younger brother Amit.
Narendra Jha  (who, ironically, had just finished working with Mr Roshan in the epic ""Mohenjo Daro"" (2016) as the madman Jakhiro, a role which could not have been more different from the quiet, reserved character here)  was especially effective in the grey character at the core of ""Kaabil"", a police Inspector teetering on the brink of the bad side.
Kudos also to Suresh Menon, in a rare non- comic relief role very well played.
A special shout-out to the technical departments which made ""Kaabil"" possible: Resul Pookutty, whose brilliant sound design enabled our understanding of Rohan's world; ace cinematographers Sudeep Chatterjee & Ayananka Bose, who showed us that world using low-light and other challenging conditions; Ahmed Khan, whose innovative choreography for 'Mon Amour' made us truly believe it was danced by sightless people, and should be up for National Award.
Composer Rajesh Roshan's album is his best since a while. I particularly like the title song 'Kaabil Hoon' that voices Rohan's commitment to Supriya and the poignant 'Kuch Din' that allows him to recall their happiest moments. But even the remix of 'Haseeno Ka Deewana' (originally 'Saara Zamaana' from ""Yaarana"" (1981)) worked well for ""Kaabil"", presenting the twisted worldview of the criminally self-centred Amit.
Last but definitely not least: director Sanjay Gupta, whose ""Kaabil"" far exceeds in quality any of his previous works.
Final note: the general attributes of a blind character doing action in a film, by compensating with hearing and smell, may hearken all the way back to Japan's ""Tale of Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman"" (1962) and the wealth of later television and film projects which flowed therefrom. But Hrithik Roshan's portrayal of blind Rohan Bhatnagar in India's ""Kaabil"" is completely unique not just in its visceral power but the emotional engagement he brings for the audience."This is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes his is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes his is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes his is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes his is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes his is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb KaabilThis is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes his is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb KaabilThis is the best movie ever the bestest SHAHRUKH acting superb Kaabil is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes is nothing compared to this movie it is the bes"In the book, story follows a man who is sent to prison for rape of a 15 year old girl, this part is not mentioned in the movie.
Did not understand and appreciate the message in the movie first. I had to read reviews and articles on the movie to understand that the author was talking about life in general. Its not about the mental asylum only. It was fun to watch Danny DeVito play one of his first roles. Pace of the movie is excellent. Liked excellent portrayal of Nurse Ratched. Some excellent camera angle work can be appreciated. You feel attached to the patients due to their acting skills. Even the ending is not straight forward one has to conceptualize and understand why and what happened. This is one of the great film endings.""It is a good movie about fighting. It doesn't matter who you are , where you live, what you have it's only matter what you truly want in your life. We all have fears, many fears and as for fighting them we need to have something motivating us. Sometimes it's real but sometimes... Movie is motivating to live, to fight and to win. What if where you now is not your place. What if somewhere in the world big things are waiting for you. What if you will lose your chance to show yourself and just be who you are. What if you will waste your life and it will to late to change anything. It's always time to begin today. It's your day, THAT day""The Shining is a great movie that gives the chills every time I watch it. A true horror classic, a masterpiece by Kubrick.
The movie tells about Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall), and their little son, Danny (played by Dan Lloyd). They move into a big, spooky, scary, empty hotel where they see and experience a ton of truly disturbing things (and ghosts aren't even the worst of them).
The movie is also visually very impressive, even today.
I'd vote 10 out of 10. Bonus points for the iconic axe scene which is absolutely unforgettable.""Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.
'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.
As always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.
Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.
It is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.
Guy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.
Overall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox""Disclaimer: I love this movie. It's basically the best one ever made. I'm not usually this positive when it comes to evaluating film, but I believe that this particular one deserves all the acclaim and more.
The thing that stands out most has to be the action sequences. They are unlike most found in modern cinema with long, uninterrupted takes and beautiful choreography that really lend themselves to the realistic, bone-crunching feel of the film. Although the complexity of plotting left something to be desired, the filmmakers more than made up for it by building a rich, creative, history-laden world around their characters.
The Action: The superb action in this movie can be directly attributed to the co-directors and their star. Both directors have been performing and coordinating big-budget film stunts for years. Chad Stahelski even doubled for Keanu Reeves in several films. Reeves's stunt background and dedication to learning his character's gunplay and martial arts styles helped bring his scenes to life in a way that would not be possible with other performers. Because of the crew's skills in the art of choreography, less cuts were needed during fight scenes which afforded them a more immersive feel.
The Music: I have never been one to get too worked up, or bogged down, by the soundtrack of any given movie. Here, however, I found myself enthralled in its effectiveness. The gentle tune ""In My Mind"" by M86 and Susie Q really stood out by paradoxically fitting perfectly into the hot tub club scene. On the other end, Marilyn Manson's ""Killing Strangers"" provided a jolting assault of the rock variety to wake me back up for the next action sequence.
The Supporting Players: Numerous interesting characters populate this original world. The performances that stand out the most come courtesy of John Leguizamo and Lance Reddick. Their introductions pulled me right into their specific areas of the criminal underworld without feeling too overbearing. Though neither muggs the screen for more than ten minutes, their impacts are felt immediately and leave a lasting impression.
The Continental: As well-executed as John Wick is, I don't think it gets nearly enough credit for its creativity. The best use of this aspect can be seen inside the hit-man hotel, The Continental. This establishment primarily hosts assassins and other underworld types to be waited on by a staff providing world-class service to its patrons unlike any other. Most importantly, the hotel pulled me in leaving me wanting to know more about the history of this world to which we had just been introduced.
The Plot: My biggest gripe with the movie has to be that the plot wears quite thin at times. Having scanned countless other reviews before writing my own, I know that this is not an unpopular opinion. It's really just a classic tale of revenge where the protagonist pursues the antagonist until somebody gives in. The reason John Wick does not suffer for its overly simplistic plot is that it stimulates the viewer in other ways like a good-old-fashioned sense of humor. It never takes itself too seriously.
I can't image that they'll come anywhere near matching the magic of John Wick with its sequel, but I'm excited for Chapter 2 all the same. As long as they expand upon the interesting underground lore presented in the first movie while preserving the high quality action scenes, I have no doubt that Chapter 2 will satisfy my need for more John Wick.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In my opinion , Show of the movie date waslate. I have been waiting for a long time, I couldn't go to cinema. Anyway I had gone. There was not so much 3D effect. Actually it was magnicifaut movie for me despite Harry Potter series ending.In my opinion Severus Snape might not die whatever Harry have been waiting for many years.If you ask ma novel or movie? Always I say novel. There was some mistakes in movie.Eyes was same of Harry and his mother in novel whatever Harry's eyes is blue and mother's eyes is black in movie. There was also confused events in movie. For example Neville Longbottom was very in passive position, but he is like star in last movie. Harry Potter's character is played by Daniel Radciliffe all movie series.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A movie about communication (and how the lack of it causes us problems). A movie about how we interpret the other (the foreigner, the unknown, the visitor) based on our own language. Obviously this is how we establish contact, how we socialize. Languages offer us a way to make ourselves understood. The problem is that there is much more than we can express with our language systems. Moreover, when we try to understand the unknown through our language, we run the risk of misinterpreting the other.
'Arrival' offers a reflection on the importance of immersing ourselves in the culture of the other when we want to understand it. It also allows us to question how our ability to think is limited by our language, our vocabulary, our communication tools. In addition, it brings the reflection about how today, more than ever, dialogues are extremely fundamental. A dialogue, when effective, allows us, in addition to getting out of our arrogant and strongly cemented ignorance, to reconcile the differences that characterize us as humans.
Although I thought the movie was amazing and beautifully conceived, (and here I put a SPOILER ALERT) I disliked the way it painted China (and Russia to some extent) as a naive and inconsequential governance, performing acts that need to be corrected by the US. Beyond the philosophical conclusions of the film, the political outcome would be that the US would remain better prepared keep its leadership. Paradoxically, I thought that, given the character of the language that demanded translation, the Chinese would be far more successful in deciphering it than the Americans. Chinese ideograms and the way they embody concepts in their symbols are much closer to the language of visitors than our Western system. But finally, I'll leave such technical analyzes to those who really understand the subject.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Why can't Hollywood make films like this anymore? I'm a sucker for puppetry, and boy is it at it's finest. The designs on them are so memorable and they're so well-constructed that it's impossible not to admire their effort and quality. The sets are also very impressive and fun to look at. I also really like how while Labyrinth is a story, it has a simple setup and feels more like an experience into a world filled with inspired imagination and strange likability. The characters are lovable and have their special characteristics to them which makes you intrigued by what they'll go through next. And of course, David Bowie as the Goblin King is a match made in heaven. His acting matches the mysterious and unique feel of the character and is fascinating to watch with every scene he's in. Jennifer Connelly also gives a good introductory performance as Sarah, who unlike most teenage characters is kids films, is tolerable and likable. Who couldn't forget the legendary Dance Magic Dance number, or the scene where Sarah is trying to get Toby through those staircases at all those different angles and areas of the castle, or the scene with the helping hands, man are there so many things to be drawn in by!
The film is a ton of fun to look at, but at the same the characters are so charming and lovable, the imagination has so much thought put into it, and the performances are so into it that it intrigues your brain and well as your eyes. While that scene with the blue-screen effects and dancing orange lizard-rats is a little unusual, it's still passable and doesn't last too long. Labyrinth is an A+, creatively and lovably imaginative film that should be witness be everyone of all ages.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Overall, I thought this movie did a good job of representing the major events of the book in a more concise way. I was glad that the director chose not make a 600+ page book that at times was hard to read into a multiple hour movie. Sitting through that would not have been pleasant. That said, given that I have read the book, I felt there were a few parts in the plot that could have been made more clear in this adaptation - namely the bulk of the investigation leading up to the climax of the story...it felt a little bit rushed to me the way they skipped out on what I felt was a more natural chain of events; instead they included a scene with a character that was not in the book to move things along.
I did however appreciate the fact that the film toned down some of the more graphic scenes of the book...they were appalling to read, let alone be shown on screen and I appreciated that the point was made without showing too many of the gory details.
I have to mention a few other things besides my commentary on the film-book differences: I really enjoyed the casting of this film. I thought it was superbly cast all the way around. Though admittedly some of my favorite characters from the book had smaller parts, I was still pleased with how everyone looked. And I can only chalk it up to the casting that surprisingly Daniel Craig's British accent surrounded by everyone else's Swedish accent still somehow worked. Also it is worth mentioning that the opening credits are absolutely amazing. I thought they captured the tone of the book so incredibly well and were mesmerizing to watch. I would recommend this movie to someone based on the credits alone, though with the caveat that this film, even certain aspects of the credits, is really not for those with a light stomach.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The average viewer rating for this movie was 7.7 before I did my rating. And I didn't read other reviews for this movie. What I usually do is watch a movie and then give a review. If its been over a month since I seen it I probably wont even give the review. I take reviews seriously and if someone decides to watch this I really want to give my opinion of it as well as be accurate. So to be honest I usually review it after days.
But with that said this movie was great for a few reasons. Its horror movie is one. I can't state enough all the terrible acting in these horror movies and yes the budget reflects that. The banks just don't support horror movies like they do Hollywood movies. And why should they. They are corny, terrible acting and not well put together plots. Doesn't sound like a turn on your investment with me.
But enough of that. What made this movie great is the plot. Seriously I just gave a review for another movie and it seems like people are having a hard time with basic things like detectives and leading an investigation. Investigations don't go as planned, they leave you in suspense, who did it. You might have one set of suspects get there and you have to start from scratch. Not sure how some of these movies just get a suspect follow him then arrest him. I guess too many perry masons and murder she wrote for some of these people. But real detectives cases, its up and down. And this movie had twist and turns.
Danny Glover didn't have a great performance but he was interesting and very interesting. And realistic, some detectives never give up period. Cases hunt them. The real honest tell in the movie is the money they made. The budget was a little over a million dollars and they made 55 million dollars and started a franchise. Which I'm sure no one expected.
And just like freddie, and pin head (before they changed him to that model looking guy who had no business acting in a horror flick) this actor who plays jigsaw really gives you the creeps. So its a great movie must see and for horror flicks it up there in the top of its class. I've wrote some reviews but not many movies are up in the top of their class. This is a must see movie.
To get a 9 they would have had to have a better actors in the first seen. The younger guy in the tub simply was terrible. Thank god I like my horror movies with terrible acting otherwise he would have cost this movie huge rating points for me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Stanley Kubrick died four days after showing Warner Bros. the alleged final cut of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Those close to him claim that he considered it his best work ever, like many great authors do in their old age. I can certainly see why Kubrick thought so (if he actually did): EWS is the absolute, perfect representation of his kind of approach to cinema. Disoriented characters, an eerie duality, in this specific case between the world of daylight and that of nighttime, broken pieces of dialogues, loss of control over one's own purposes. In one sentence, Bill is THE Kubrickian character. The story itself, another adaptation from a novel, is hauntingly mysterious, with its apparently random encounters of strange characters, from the menacing unnamed follower to the sketchy owner of the ""Rainbow"" shop. The night wanderings by Bill reminded me of a simple, yet smart film by Martin Scorsese, ""After Hours"", which could be an inspiration for some of it. Another engaging aspect are the many inner links between different scenes that eventually add up to nothing but give a weird sense of connection and of a bigger scheme behind Bill's actions: the one that struck me most was the ""Place under the rainbow"" reference made by the two models at the party, which connects to a locale under the ""Rainbow"" shop where Bill buys his costume. As in most his films, Kubrick has a taste for the esoteric, hinting at many things without explaining anything clearly, which is to me his most interesting style feature. Ironically, I think that in this film Kubrick was so explicit while attempting to show us his own way of cinema that it loses some of the wonder the viewer has in his most ingenious works, first of all ""2001"", where the idea behind the film is so hidden and unclear that to understand it makes for one of the greatest experiences cinema can offer.
Kubrick's style choices for this picture are more similar to those made in ""Barry Lyndon"" than it may seem, for two reasons. Most scenes are shot with the impression of using only ""natural"" light, meaning there is no stage illumination but only lamps, Christmas lights and so on. Christmas trees are everywhere and their multicolored lights take us back to the ""rainbow"" theme, meaning the bright side of the world, under which lies the darkness of raw desire (see the models...). Secondly, Tom Cruise is used more like a mask himself than an actual man: his expressions are recurring and almost unnatural, as he tries to find his way in the labyrinth of his perceptions.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were married at the time of shooting, which reinforces the fact that Kubrick loved the interaction between reality and fiction. If in ""A Clockwork Orange"" the viewer actually goes through the Ludwig cure, here he has the opportunity of seeing unveil a crisis in a couple played by one of the most famous couples of the time. While I loved Cruise's acting, Kidman's felt a little too obvious and extreme, although I don't know how much of a fault she has in it, as Kubrick always had total control over his works.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Even though ""War Dogs"" isn't claimed to be an action film it has certain aspects of the mise-en-scene which puts it under the action genre. Such as, guns money and drugs. It is an all round spectacle.
I really liked the way this film was edited as sometimes we see captions pop up on screen such as ""if i wanted you dead, you'd already be dead"". Then, over the next few scenes we will hear the lines be said. My opinion of it was a nice touch from the editing crew as it makes the audience prepared on what the chapter is about. A lot like Tarantino's films.
During the film, we see the personalities of two friends and throughout the movie we see their personalities evolve as well as their friendship. Packouz (Miles Teller) is a masseuse working in Miami and at a funeral we learn that his junior high friend Diveroli (Jonah Hill) is an International arms dealer. When we find out that Packouz is having a baby, Diveroli takes him on to work at his company to earn more money. This gratitude of kindness and help gives the audience an idea on how friendship should be used and is the main moral of the story for me.
For most of ""War Dogs"", i loved Hill's character as we got to see his personality in a good way. However, after the FBI find out that Diveroli and Packouz have done illegal movements in getting 10,000,000 rounds of bullets to Afghanistan for the American military Packouz doesn't want to speak to him. In the final few scenes, we see Diveroli and Packouz in an elevator and Diveroli tells Packouz he was acting as his friend. This made me extremely shocked because we as an audience had learned to love this character and in an instance all respect had gone, making the scene have a powerful effect on the audience.
Overall, I loved this film and it signified the real meaning of trust and friendship and was a great spectacle.""I absolutely loved this movie, I had watched it in 1992 and never forgot Dil's character and the scorpion/ frog story. While browsing for interesting movies of the 90's I immediately identified Dil's face on google. I saw it now again, twice, because it is simply an amazing picture with messages that need to be understood about gender, sexuality, personality and identity. Great writing, superb acting (all the actors are doing a great job: Forest Whitaker, the IRA terrorists, the barman, Dave the crazy guy, etc), engaging soundtrack and with something of a moral twist behind it. It looks like a love story but it is really a story about love. You don't see many movies like this anymore. Don't miss out!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** What dreams may come is an excellent movie of Vicent Ward in 1998, however this film is little known between people.
This movie have many important and essential elements, all together make one dear story, this elements are: -The story between Chris Nielsen and Annie Collins before and after of death. -The nostalgic and profound soundtrack. -The impressive special effects about the life after of death. -The photography of nature and art.
I consider some parts of film are interesting: -During the Chris's travel, he has memories with each member of family. -When Chris realize his transition to the other life, he wake up in a place makes of paint, like impressionist art. -The communication between Annie and Chris trough of painting. -The absence of angels and demons, but the story affirms the God's existence. -The takes of nature: purple trees, waterfall, mountains and sky. These pictures give us an comfortable and surrealistic sensations.
The story can divide in specific parts: -The life between Christopher and Annie: when they were young, their marriage, their children, the death of Ian and Marie and finally the Chris's death. -Chris discovers the life after of death: the Chris's soul sees his wife, Chris going to the light (transition to the other life), Chris insides his own universe, first of paint later to the reality, in this lapse, he finds his ancient chief, Albert, and his daughter. -Chris going to hell: Annie suicides, Chris and Albert seek the tracker, the three go to hell, like Dante's Inferno, for rescue Annie, Chris discovers his son, finally Chris finds and talks with her wife. -The final resolution: Chris and Annie go to heaven and they decide to reincarnate for have a new story.
Finally, I believe that 'What dreams may come' is a excellent movie for many reasons and I believe that this film could get one better recognition for more people.""The sheer volume of prolific writer/director/actor Woody Allen's back catalogue means that any new work will always have audiences comparing them to his earlier, more universally-acclaimed pictures. Born in 1935, it has been over fifty years since his first peek behind the camera with What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966), and he still pumps out roughly a film per year. The declining quality doesn't help either, with (before Midnight in Paris) his only truly excellent film being the incredibly sexy Vicky Christina Barcelona (2008) since 1999's charming Sweet and Lowdown. Perhaps he had the idea for years, but it felt like Allen may be having a sly pop at the nostalgia-fiends feeding off his past glories with Midnight in Paris, a heart-warming and funny exploration of a writer pining for a bygone age.
Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a successful Hollywood screenwriter holidaying in Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams). He is also struggling with his first novel, about a man working in a nostalgia shop, and his bride-to-be isn't helping matters by insisting they spend time with her rich, conservative parents and her annoying, know-it- all friend Paul (Michael Sheen). Gil feels like he belongs in a different decade, namely 1920's Paris, where the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Salvador Dali enjoyed decadent parties and frequented the boisterous bars. On a walk one night, Gil is approach by an old-fashioned taxi as the clock strikes midnight, and the passengers beckon him to join them. Soon enough, he is chatting with the likes of Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his wife Zelda (Alison Pill), as Cole Porter (Yves Heck) plays piano.
As Gil's nightly visits to the 1920's play out, a wealth of famous faces bring other famous faces to life. The likes of Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and Dali (Adrien Brody) all brush shoulders with the awestruck writer, as well as the mysterious Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a muse of Picasso who catches his eye. The fantastic performances aside - Stoll is a particular revelation - Paris itself is a star of the movie, akin to what Allen did may times with his New York-set films. It's certainly overly-romanticised, but this only serves to heighten Gil's sense of wonder, and he is hopeless romantic after all. Midnight in Paris is Allen's wittiest, warmest and most effortlessly entertaining films since 1994's Bullets Over Broadway. It may be difficult to avoid comparing this to the director's classic works, but Midnight in Paris sits easily as one of his best.""First of all, I love Mel Gibson as a director. Not as a celebrity or as a wife-beater, but as an artist. Two of his films, Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, have both become instant favorites of mine. It's been 10 years since his last film, Apocalypto (which I haven't seen yet). When I heard he made a new film, I was hooked immediately. I suppose the main reason I love Gibson's directing style is because he gets really intimate with the content and characters of his films, close-ups and all. When I saw Hacksaw Ridge in a nearly-empty theater, my expectations were exceeded. The intensity of the battle scenes, and I cannot believe I'm saying this, rival those of Saving Private Ryan. During those scenes, the whole theater rumbled like an earthquake with the sounds of gunshots, flying bullets, mortars, grenades, and earth- shattering explosions. The gore was not in the least bit hidden or sugar coated. There was blood, bones, and limbless bodies galore! Because that's the way the Battle of Okinawa really was. Surprisingly, I wouldn't call the violence gratuitous but I know that other people would. Even casted B-movie actors Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington couldn't bring this film down. The only thing that I genuinely condemn about the movie was the portrayal of the Japanese soldiers, who were portrayed as a mix of savages and zombies. It's definitely an American propaganda film, but even so, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.""When is crime justifiable? Never, but.That seems to be the philosophical question mulled in this fast beat thriller as written by Stephen Cyrus Sepher and directed by Scott Mann. While the film is primarily one of action, the impact of the starting characters is such that the theme seems more thoughtful than most action films.
A father Luke Vaughn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is without the means to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. As a last resort, he partners with a greedy co-worker Cox (Dave Bautista) to rob a casino owned by the agile but terminally ill man called The Pope (Robert DeNiro) and his maniacal right hand man, Dog (Morris Chestnut). When things go awry they're forced to hijack a city bus 657 driven by Bernie (DB Sweeney) and take the passengers hostage. Now, in a high speed chase, Vaughn will not only have to outwit the police, led by Officer Bajos (Gina Carano) who are in hot pursuit, but he will have to contend Dog in order to make it through the day alive. But we quickly learn that things are not what they seem, and Vaughn has more than one card up his sleeve.
Clever, well conceived plot with many twists and turns and brought of by a very fine cast, including small parts by Kate Bosworth, Stephen C Sepher (yes, the writer!), Christopher Rob Bowen, Alyssa Julya Smith, Hawn Tran, and Tyler Jon Olson. A solid thriller worth an evening's watch.""Greetings from Lithuania.
""Frozen"" (2013) is a one amazingly looking good feel animated movie for a youngest members of a family. Adults surely won't like it as much as ""Shrek"" or etc. because this is a more friendly and cheezee movie oriented for the youngest audiences. Yes, it is cheezee as hell if you ask me, with especially some songs scenes looking more like an Eurovision song contest then actual movie, and with some songs (which become very popular) to which if i would need to ever listen to one more time again... don't ask.
Overall, ""Frozen"" is a beautifully looking, sometimes a bit (but just a bit funny) animated movie targeted especially for the youngest. It is a good nature movie, and its pacing is the best thing for more adults - at running time 1 h 35 min it almost never dragged. It is a good movie to see it once, but it isn't as original or exciting as i kinda hoped it would be.""With a Victorian asylum-based movie, you'd be forgiven for having preconceived notions of how the movie was going to go, but I was pleasantly surprised.
Excellent performances from Ben Kingsley & David Thewlis, Kate Beckinsale was also quite good, but I found it frankly odd that Jason Flemyng would take such a minor part after relative success in other movies such as Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and X-Men: First Class. I'd say he deserves bigger roles.
This flick gets a 9 from me for the acting, and the interesting ideas that it raises with regard to the treatment of psychiatric patients in those days.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I was eleven years old when ""Psycho"" was first shown at theaters in 1960. My mother absolutely prohibited me from seeing it, so I was soon secretly on my way by bus to the Ritz in downtown Elizabeth, New Jersey, probably by myself so that there would be no witnesses. I was so traumatized after the first half hour that I don't think that I had a clue as to what followed, even if I could understand it at the time. I wonder how many adults in attendance could still focus on the ensuing action during their very first viewing of ""Psycho"" on the wide screen.
From the opening pan shot of 1959 downtown Phoenix and the subsequent zoom into the intimate hotel room of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin), this movie never fails to maintain my interest even after many viewings over the past 57 years. It's just that good. No viewing, however, will ever have the same, terrifying impact of the first.
As talented as Alfred Hitchcock is as a director, and this movie ranks among the best of his many brilliant works, I do not believe that ""Psycho"" would have the same shocking effect without Bernard Hermann's remarkable, extremely tense score, which consists solely of nerve- racking string instruments.
In addition to the outstanding direction, musical score, and photography by John L. Russell, I thought that the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins were exceptionally good. In the case of Leigh, I have followed her career from her earliest films of the late 1940's (The Romance of Rosy Ridge, Act of Violence, etc.), and I believe that this stands tall as her greatest role. The handling of the resolution of Marion's inner conflict at a critical moment while she dines with Norman is especially effective, and her entire portrayal is Oscar worthy, even if she does only appear for less than thirty minutes. Apparently, Perkins' acting career fell victim to his own success here as his portrayal of Norman Bates was so iconic that he could not easily be identified by audiences as anyone else! In his small but significant role, I also thought that Frank Albertson as the fat cat who actually owned the $40,000 was terrific, and he seemed to relish his role as he flirted with Marion, a much younger woman. Pat Hitchcock as Marion's colleague at the real estate office was very amusing, and Vera Miles was very fine as Lila, Marion's distraught sister.
The one major flaw for me, as well as for other reviewers here, is Simon Oakland's awkward monologue at the end, which I found not only unnecessary but harmful to the film as a whole. While I didn't understand a word of it at the age of eleven, it still gives me a headache as a senior citizen today. Norman seated in the padded cell with the very creepy voice-over and the haunting, subtle superimposition over his image doesn't require Oakland's ridiculous and ponderous explanation at all. What makes it even worse is his psychiatrist character's inappropriate gleefulness as Lila and Sam finally learn the truth about Marion for the first time. This is such an impressive film overall that even this nonsense can't ruin it for me. I won't allow it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** For a movie that is based off of a true historical event, it's often difficult to find the right balance of an interesting plot and an educational experience for the audience. However, Free State of Jones seemed to have found the proper balance between these elements. For example, multiple scenes which contained action and more viewer appealing content(which was all realistic) would soon be followed by a dramatic death with an eerie five person funeral or the torching of someone's property. This is effective in any war related film because although these events almost all took place outside of the battlefield, it reminded us of the harsh reality of life during a war, which in this case was full of racism, corruption, and deserters and runaway slaves plotting rebellion. Another thing this movie did well was show the long term effects the Civil War had in America. Although the switch from Newton to his descendant Davis wasn't always the smoothest or most logical, the ending clarified that even 80 or so years after emancipation, segregation and racial differences continued to divide the South. Free State of Jones demonstrated that it could cause problems for any man with the slightest trace of African American in him at the time, like Davis. Therefore, I give this film an 8 out of 10 as I believe it had the perfect amount of information and actual movie plot to keep it educational and entertaining at the same time.""any times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you've seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you've been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that's me.
Notwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to ""move"" me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan's room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That's for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don't know and I don't care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don't watch this film if you're looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don't even skip this film thinking it's children's movie  no it isn't. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people's lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.
Okay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo day Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it's two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They're there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** HOW I GET A LOAN HELP @ 2% INTEREST RATE With victoriafinancier@outlook.com

Most thrillers and stories that center around murders and revenge are not that emotionally compelling. Their appeal tends to come more from the mystery of the story and the shock factor of revelations. Memento is not lacking one bit in this area, but goes a step further by delivering on an emotional level and perhaps even making us question the way we go through life.
Leonard's condition be a unique one that the majority of audiences have no experience with, but he's really no different than the rest of us. He just has a diagnosis to highlight it. All of us stumble through life with misconceptions because of the limited information we have. Leonard has to deal with the same thing, just on a heightened level. His solution is good in theory: only rely on facts. But by the end we realize that ""fact"" can be a malleable thing. Once Leonard decides that Teddy is his ""John G."", it does not really matter whether Teddy is his wife's murderer. That's Leonard's reality and he doesn't let himself think twice about it. Self -deception like the kind seen in this film can be beneficial as much as it can be harmful, but it was more powerful and striking to have the story end in tragedy.
The backward progression, while it may seem like a gimmick at first glance, was definitely a good move. The nature of the story called for it to be told in reverse. Watching Memento in chronological order would probably make more sense, but it would end up being a rather dry story. Most of the mystery and drama would be lost.
Our characters were not the most enjoyable to see on screen, but I think they were created well. Teddy, Leonard, and Natalie are actually pretty normal people without any personal qualities that made me like them. But all three of them had motives, flaws, and emotions like real people do, which made the movie as a whole better. It just wasn't shown in a flashy way that called for any great acting performances or snappy dialogue.
This is an excellent pick if you like thrillers and if you like non-linear story telling. If you like guessing the ending of movies and bragging to your friends about how good you are at predicting how things will play out, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. While there is a fabulous twist ending that will drop your jaw without resorting to fanfare, it is not the kind of twist that can be predicted based on what has already been shown. It's a very psychological story, which is what I love about it, but I know some people prefer more straightforward and external story structures. So just be aware of that. One final caution: this is not the type of movie that will gross you out or make your stomach turn with vicious murders and gore, but it could be emotionally upsetting. You will not feel hopeful at the end. All the same, enjoy! Overall Rating: 8.9/10."Real Steel is really a excellent movie ever I saw. Which is most popular to children and young also. it's starting to end everything is so excellent to me. A boy is changing his life with his father is so good to all father also. it's also future realistic and future world is going to be like this. now we are using smart phone and later will keep a robot in our house. So all are future related also. really a famous movie to me and I always watch this movie when I get free time. Other side past created robot is also showing a good image which is showing past also. past + present + future is real life which is also reality of Real Steel."Everything about this movie is excellent. the script, directing and oh my god amazing dialogues. Ajay Devgn wearing white cloths and his acting is one of the best of all time. the movies show why Ajay Devgn is one of the most versatile and amazing actor not only in Bollywood but world. amazing amazing movie. the movie has perfect casting and all actor has done amazing job, for most actor this movie is a higlight of their career. it is sad that they miss cast actors in second movie. this movie is the reason that upcoming Bollywood movie baadshaho is one of the most anticipated movie of year with Ajay Devgn, Emran Hasimi and Milan Luthria coming together again.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie could be classified as two short movies with reoccurring characters, but this is not detrimental to the movie as it shows the stages that the soldiers go through from raw recruits, to new arrivals to battle hardened veterans. The first part of this movie thanks to R Lee Ermey's, whose performance was phenomenal, real life experience as a drill sergeant made it really authentic and believable as the recruits went through their basic training, the fact that Kubrick let Ermey improvise his lines is an indication of how strong his performance was. The rest of the cast didn't need to act as if they were terrified of him as the genuinely were. In the second half, the movie focuses on Matthew Modine's Private Joker's time in Vietnam who observes the dehumanising effect of the war on both himself and fellow recruits, amid the carnage and bloodshed, when he sees first hand the war for the hell it really is. Now in comparing it with Platoon, as I've said in my review of that movie, you can't really compare it with this as they depict two very different aspects of the war. That movie depicts the war in jungle, whereas this movie, especially part two portray the urban warfare of the Tet Offensive, particularly the bitter bloody street fighting in Hue, which the Americans had to deal with the enemies underhanded tactics such as snipers and booby traps, and as a result has been described by some historians as the Stalingrad of the Vietnam war. In summary this movie is an authentic depiction of what raw recruits went through in the Vietnam war, and how they had to adapt to the hellish conditions which they fought, a must own for all war movie lovers.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Kubo has amazing presentation of a kids story. It's very clear on this right from the start. Our narrator is untrustworthy drawing inspiration from the many tales he's been told. You will know 90% of the story before the halfway mark. But the journey is the fun part.
Kubo is very direct in it's symbolism. TheJapanese mother who tells stories of the western inspired father. The story of how he took her from here father who was blind to the world. But through the combination of western and Japanese art the her father is able to see the world. But only once the smoke of fear cast by the selfish daughters is cleared.
That's about the deepest and least direct symbolism I got out the movie. Everything else is spelled out for the kids to understand. The monkey and beetle being the father and mother was told to you in case you didn't notice the major gifts from the mother and father being a monkey statue and a robe with a beetle on it.
The character development is also lacking. Everyone has one motivation that isn't supported by much more than that's what they exist for.
Kubo reminds me a lot of Life of Pi. Great presentation with very direct explanation of symbolism. If it left more up to the audience to notice I would give it another star and if it had a tiny bit more character development it would be a perfect score.""Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics.
The film stars the daughter of a chief who sets of on journey to save her island. She journeys to find Maui, a mischievous block of tattooed muscles, I mean demigod, to help her save the world. They bond, fight, laugh and save the world with the help of the dumbest chicken you have ever met.
The film doesn't exactly break boundaries, break from its typical story lines, explore mature themes or entertain adults the same way it can children. There are a lot animations that do this and Moana isn't one of them. I think this is the main reason people can't appreciate Moana. But WOW! It certainly leaves you feeling all chipper and sing-songy.
It's an utterly beautiful, light hearted (with an occasional tear jerker) and humorous film. If you don't like Frozen, Big Hero 6 or Finding Dory please don't watch. This is a movie I will recommend to anyone and everyone because its definitely in Disneys top 10 out of what...like 200 films.
For people who are complaining about plot and character dev. Please stop. Disney has worked to the bone to avoid cultural appropriation and misrepresentation whilst offering a visually stunning, humorous and adventurous plot. Sorry, if they didn't include that plot twist you were salivating for.
Its get 10/10 instead 9/10 because I enjoyed this movie too much."*** This review may contain spoilers *** I've seen this film quite a few times now I remember first seeing it in theaters in May 2015 the tribute to Paul Walker at the end with the song See You Again really brought tears to my eyes I still can't believe that he's gone...gone but not forgotten by his Fast and Furious family I loved I could tell that what Dom was saying at the end was really from the heart Vin Diesel really thought of Paul Walker as his brother in real life as well as in the films and that really touched me. We all know what this last film is about...Deckard Shaw seeks revenge on Dom and his crew for crippling his brother in Fast and Furious 6 you see how he goes after Han first then hacks into Hobbs' computer to find out who else was involved after calling Dom and sending him a message by blowing up his house so this is pretty much an action/revenge film in the end Deckard and Dom have a street fight which is pretty epic the soundtrack in this is also amazing to me this is probably Vin Diesel's best performance in the Fast and Furious series I also loved Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw and I'm glad he's coming back in The Fate of The Furious which is coming out this April but for me I don't think it will top this one it looks awesome but not as good as this. Paul Walker you are missed R.I.P. I give this a 10/10 and if you're a fan of the films and have not yet seen this I strongly advise that you do."""Inception"" works for the viewer, in a way, like the world itself worked for Leonard, the hero of ""Memento."" We are always in the Now. We have made some notes while getting Here, but we are not quite sure where Here is. Yet matters of life, death and the heart are involved--oh, and those multi-national corporations, of course. And Nolan doesn't pause before using well-crafted scenes from spycraft or espionage, including a clever scheme on board a 747 (even explaining why it must be a 747).
The movies often seem to come from the recycling bin these days: Sequels, remakes, franchises. ""Inception"" does a difficult thing. It is wholly original, cut from new cloth, and yet structured with action movie basics so it feels like it makes more sense than (quite possibly) it does. I thought there was a hole in ""Memento:"" How does a man with short-term memory loss remember he has short-term memory loss? Maybe there's a hole in ""Inception"" too, but I can't find it. Christopher Nolan reinvented ""Batman."" This time he isn't reinventing anything. Yet few directors will attempt to recycle ""Inception."" I think when Nolan left the labyrinth, he threw away the map.""12 Years of Slavery reaches theaters about 126 after the abolition of slavery in Brazil, which occurred with the Golden Law of 1888. The United States ended slavery a few decades earlier in 1863, but in a much more conflicting process that generated A war that divided the country. 1863 and 1888 ... it was so long since one would have expected that racism was not so much a problem in our society. Of course, it has improved, as shown by the election of an Afro- descendant to the post of US president, but situations like that of the soccer player Tinga, who heard the Peruvian fans mimicking monkeys every time he touched the ball in a game for the 2014 Libertadores, Or the beaten Negro, naked and chained in a pole in Rio de Janeiro, show why it is a very current film. And it deserves to be watched.
12 Years of Slavery - FotoSolomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a freed black man living with his family in the northern United States. He is a respected musician and lives normally. Certain day, he is cheated by work partners and taken to the south, where he is sold as a slave. From then on, we have a succession of harsh scenes and stomach-turning moments, reminiscent of The Passion of Christ, but without Mel Gibson's sadism.
After performing the brilliant Shame, Steve McQueen invests in a historical epic and does well again. He leaves aside the sober, gray photograph that represented the spirit of Michael Fassbender's character, to invest in hotter shots, as a result of the Southern United States' climate and the desperate situation of the protagonist.
A long-time director partner, Sean Bobbitt performs another great job in photography. It is distressing how you invest in detail plans, bringing the camera closer to objects and body parts of the characters. At the same time that the technique catches attention at a time when Solomon's hands play a violin, it has an impact when portraying the lashes received by him.
12 Years of Slavery - Photo In a few moments, the feature falls into stereotypes by depicting the white man from the north as progressive and considerate and the south as the caricature of the devil, but even this is solved by the presence of more complex characters such as Of Benedict Cumberbatch, a more welcoming and less repressive slave lord. Their presence, however, turns out to be quite questioning. Yes, he has no pleasure in torturing his slaves and even shows a little affection with Solomon, but he does not stop treating him as a commodity. In this sense, the racism coming from the character of Cumberbatch is of the one that we still see today in phrases like: ""I am not racist, I have black friends.""
After passing through the hands of Master Ford (Cumberbatch), Solomon will land in the lands of Edwin Epps (Fassbender), a brutal lord who treats his slaves with iron hands. The actor delivers an impressive performance, exuding hatred and revolt. He, however, manages to flee the caricature by presenting a relationship of possession and desire with the slave Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o). While waking the slaves to dance for him in the middle of the night, Fassbender demonstrates a true (though sickly) feeling before the young slave girl.
12 Years of Slavery - Photo12 Years a Slave (in the original) has all his strength in not being a pamphleteer. In this sense, it is a great counterpoint to the recent (and mediocre) The White House Butler and Cross Stories. The story (in the broad sense of the word) is already hard enough and does not need melodramatic reinforcements. Instead of many closes and phrases of effect, the director opts for raw and tense scenes. This is shown clearly in the two sex scenes of the production. In one of them, in fact, we see the rape of a slave by her master, which clearly reinforces the idea of ​​property and ultimate consequences. The other is between two slaves and is one of the hardest sequences of the film. There is no desire, there is the search for an escape valve, then to give in to despair.
The film is the clear synthesis of that classic cliché that ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". When we come across a slave practically hanged on a tree, surviving only by dragging his feet in the mud, it impacts more than all the catch phrases of similar productions. In the scene in question, it is evident yet all the work of sound design. All we hear is the breathing muffled by the rope and the feet scraping superficially the floor, besides the very creaking of the rope in the tree. It is an anthological sequence that will leave many people with their breath caught (puns aside). The way the world usually happens around that slave in a deplorable situation is as shocking as violence itself.
Without showing this to every picture, McQueen ends up making a movie more political than Lincoln himself.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I didn't know much about Milkha Singh's biography before watching this movie. But after watched, I surprised how a common person becomes a great world champion with his running skills. It's a real life story which I like the most. It's really inspired people to become like Milkha Singh. I watched full movie I never got bored.
Farhan played a very important role. He should have awarded for his great contribution. No one can play Milkha's role as played by Farhan.
I feel proud for him and respect such kind of peoples whose were the iconic person of India. He was really an awesome guy. I would like to watch it again and again.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I remember renting this movie when it first came out on DVD. And thought of it as a funny and cleverly executed movie that I wanted to watch again later on. It isn't as amazing as I remember it to be but it's still a very clever black comedy with heavily flawed but likable characters. It's a neo-noir film that has a more fast placed and edgy feel to it all. Although the biggest payoff and fame came from Robert Downey, Jr. playing Tony Stark. This is the role I remember Downey the most from. It's difficult to play a thief that is all talk and lack common sense and yet still very likable. But Downey managed to pull it off thanks to his acting chops and because of the writing. And probably his character is someone that can resonate with a lot of people. This is also Val Kilmer's 3rd most memorable role for me. He was just excellent as an overly sarcastic and somewhat pompous private investigator. And what drives this movie is the interactions and banters between these two characters. Overall I thoroughly still enjoyed this film and will probably watch it again in a few years...Maybe.
8.5/10""This movie has showed how legendary Steven Spielberg is. He did an outstanding performance directing it. The idea of making it in black and white was pure genius, it showed how life was drained during the holocaust. Superb acting by everyone especially Ralph Fiennes. And I have to say it again Spielberg did a legendary job!!! The story being real made the movie more interesting and more sad and dramatic than it is. Some people called it the saddest movie ever made and one of the most influential biographies ever told.
A bold and daring movie that had o be forbidden in many countries for its realism and showing the cruelty of the Nazis.
Watch for yourself and see Spielberg's greatness."It is a pleasant motion picture. performing artist Dhanush is quite recently brilliant in it. it is an unquestionable requirement watch motion picture.

This month we will be discussing ""The Dark Knight Rises"". I loved this movie. It is no ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) which was perfectly made but it does its job as a finale and closing movie. Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I am a Batman fan. I loved it from Adam West to Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989). Has it been that long already?! There have been tons of Batman movies as well as TV shows and they are all good in their own way. From Adam West to the animated series I use to watch from 1992 to 1995. They all have their own little spice to them. It's like trying to argue which is the best pizza Italy's or New York's. It's all taste and there are different pizzas and Batmans for everyone's taste! What a great world! There are a bunch of little Easter eggs and treats for the batman fan in this movie. From surprise characters to throw backs even returning cast members from previous films. This movie is a fun ride, with mixed emotions and lots of stress. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the end of a great trilogy and sometimes that's a little hard to swallow. That's why this movie has been criticized by some. It's hard to understand that you can close a story and finish it just right. Going into details will spoil the film for you but you have to remember that Bruce Wayne is a human with no super powers. The movie had to end the way it did. Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says When you make a trilogy there are rules to follow. One of the rules is to treat all three movies as one, with a first, second and third act. In the first film you are introduced to the characters (boring). Second you create havoc and put them in horrible places, which is awesome. Third you close it all and end it with a bang which causes sadness, joy and tons of other mixed feelings. ""Batman Begins"" showed you that Batman can be real and someone can train and build costumes and armor for such an undertaking as becoming a super hero. ""The Dark Knight"" showed you what a sequel should show you. Everything falling apart around the beloved characters we all learned to love from the first film (Think about ""Empire Strikes Back""). The Dark Knight Rises"" closes the trilogy in great fashion. Bane was awesome! Aside from sounding a little bit like Sean Connery, he was maniacal, and very tactical. He was no thug, having a plan since the first scene and he was smart. Also to point out one of the best beginning sequences ever! I am not going to say Michelle Pfeiffer is the one and only Catwoman but I AM going to say that her Catwoman WAS Catwoman! Anne Hathaway's character was a Catwoman type of a thief in this movie but not the Catwoman she could have been. Then again, you wouldn't have the ending you got. So in actuality she was the prefect, (see what I did there?), Catwoman in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe. Jack ""The Parent"" says The movie is rated PG-13 and well you know how I feel about the rating scale. I think as a parent we all individually need to judge movies ourselves. The whole ripping the heart out of a man's chest and casting him to the fire scene in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" only got that film a PG and if it was released today it would have been R. Be that as it may, there are some dark issues in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" so keep it 13""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One of the very few movies that has made me cringe. It shows how weak our minds become when,Something happens and we do not know how to react because the act is simply disgusting and we become blind accusers blind, people become manipulate with no personal opinion without valid evidence and proof, regardless of the maturity of people. A word and a feeling can quickly rip a life apart. This is what happens when people jump to conclusions, lives get ruined. That's what happens when people lie. The girls can't be really blamed for all this because she does not understand what she did for the simple fact that she Is just a child and she has no idea how deep Her words can cute a persons dignity.
for example when the mother actually convinces Klara that it did happen. Now what would happen if a mother did that in a custody battle out of spite and just because she's evil; convince her kids that their father hurt them and abused them and it was so terrible that they just can't remember? Everyone including his family would grow up hating him and for nothing.
I just wanted to point out that the Scene were the child psychologist did was wrong and unskilled, know that you are not supposed to imply an answer and nudge children in the assumed direction. When he was was asking Klara questions, he clearly handled it quite poorly. Klara clearly hated to be called a liar or was scared to get punished as she wanted outside when Her parents were Yelling, signaling she was terrified if that happened to her, so she just went along with whatever he was saying. I really hope this is not how things work in the real world. Great movie though, illogicality aside.﻿
What i think happened with Klara
Confabulation is distinguished from lying as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false. Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal, Specially in the mind of such a young child.
Spoilers
There are 2 meanings to the ending.
1) is that he will be always hunted because society never forgets once it sees someone as a predator. No matter how innocent you are - you will always be hunted.
2) he was shot at by his friends son because he firmly believe Lucas was guilty, and never realized that the picture he showed Klara would trigger the events, and i have certainty that he also killed Fanny.""If you want a movie that is entertaining, funny, action-packed with twists and turns throughout - then this movie is for you! The animation quality is as good as any out there.
The voice actors are sensational. Kelsey Grammar and Andy Samberg and their back and forth bantering is totally brilliant and any of us involved in business can understand the dynamic and completely understand the humour.
It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and never get bored.
Kids love it and there is plenty of content to keep adults laughing.
This movie is a terrific and I can't understand how anyone could not thoroughly enjoy this movie!""Chances are, if you've watched any popular movie over the last fifteen years or so, you've probably heard the line, 'The first rule of *whatever* is do not talk about *whatever.*' This is of course the most famous line from the Brad Pitt/Edward Norton 1999 classic, 'Fight Club.' In a nutshell, Fight Club is so good it's spawned many parodies and rip-offs, none of which have even come close to emulating just how good it is.
I'll give you a brief plot synopsis, but leave it there, as if I go into too much detail, I start running the risk of letting slip some major spoilers. Edward Norton plays a bored and run-down salesman who spends his days flying across America selling his wares. However, his dull life takes a turn for the interesting when he happens to bump into Tyler Durden (or rather Brad Pitt) on a plane. The two of them form an unlikely bond and come up with a novel way of dealing with male stress in the modern age  they beat the hell out of each other for fun. And, believe it or not, this idea soon spreads across the nation and 'Fight Clubs' start springing up everywhere.
It's about now in the review where I list the good and bad points of the film. However, I can't actually think of anything negative to say about Fight Club and, if I listed all its plus points then I'd probably be here all day. There's very little wrong with this film in general  it has everything from great central performances from Pitt, Norton and Helena Bonham Carter (and even a sterling performance from Meat Loaf  who'd have thought!) to wry social commentary, snappy dialogue and those plot points I refuse to mention for fear of being hounded off the internet for spoiling movies.
As I've already eluded to, there's definitely more to it than the synopsis, but anything more may ruin the surprises in store. Whether you like dark, intelligent thrillers or just want to see Brad Pitt topless, you really should check this film out at some stage. It's already a classic and, even after all these years, holds up very well with its themes of fragile male ego, bonding and the establishment in general.
When I watched it last I felt it had an almost 'Hitchcock-vibe' to it all, which would explain why it all feels so dark and timeless. If you haven't seen it, don't ask people about it, as they may well give away bits of it that will stay with you forever. Just watch it. Then re-watch it again with a completely different view of it all when you know what it's really about.""I really enjoy this movie. It is both a love story and a comedy. The casting is superb. The pairing of Beatty and Christie is wonderful and helps advance the love story. They had this on screen attraction and comfort being with each other. After I first saw this movie, I found out that they had previously dated. And, the other main actors, James Mason, Buck Henry, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon and Jack Warden, are wonderful in their roles. The end of the movie is special. I watch this movie from time to time and always enjoy it. Beatty deserves a lot of credit for the casting, writing, directing and acting. I hope one day it will be available on blu-ray.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano must rescue the kidnapped son of Jabba the Hutt, but political intrigue complicates their mission. Even tho it does have problems with story telling and some characters ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" remains an interesting chapter in the Star Wars Saga it still has a lot of lightsaber fight sequences, some of the jokes were pretty good even tho it was made for children and the dialogue was nice plus Ahsoka Tano does more in this movie than the actual Prequel Trilogy. It does have problems tho like i said with the story which could have been way better although little Hutt was pretty good and funny, having Jabba's Uncle felt a bit unnecessary and the opening intro was a bit weird but overall it was great having to go back to this world before Darth Vader and all this but also it was great to have a ""Great"" Prequel. (8.8/10)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Free State of Jones in which Newton Knight played by Matthew McConaughey struggles with the values of the confederacy. The death of his nephew and that the confederate army were taking supplies from poor townspeople pushed him over the edge enough for him to want to rebel against the Confederacy. In this film it shows the moral struggle between what Knight thinks to be right or wrong. When faced with this dilemma he looks to morals over barbarous actions. He eventually realizes that he doesn't want to be on the side in which it dehumanizes actual human beings. The movie overall was an 8. The acting is top notch and being based on a true story the accuracy was mostly all there.This movie is a very action filled American war story but, you can tell there are different moral messages also being portrayed.""I didn't intend to watch this movie but my kids wanted to see it. I was doing other stuff while they were watching it and somehow I got into it. The songs were really nice with some new ones and some covers of 80s songs. The story is pretty basic but the dialogue is very funny. Cooper made me laugh out loud with his sparse lines. Its too bad that we didn't get to know each of the trolls as they seem all interesting. The movie is not that long so I guess there was not enough time to flesh them out.
Overall, its a light-hearted fun movie which will put you in a good mood... if you give it a chance.""To start off the review I should mention that I am an 18 year old male university student and I can say that I enjoyed this movie. When most animated movies state that they are for the whole family, they often are quite childish and boring for the older members, but I can gladly say that this movie would be enjoyable for all ages. For example there are jokes that might be wasted on the younger children that gave me a laugh. The scenery for this movie is beautiful, serene even. What worked for Tangled and Frozen definitely worked for Moana. The voice acting was ideal, beautiful singing voice from Moana. Really emotive singing and meaning behind the lyrics, while respecting the Polynesian background. The movie is simply a feel good movie, great storyline that is easy to follow but isn't spoon feeding the audience. If there was to be a negative, it would be that the main characters did not really develop their friendship, there was little character development from Moana and that the movie was quite short in comparison. Regardless, it is a great movie that I will be watching again. Fantastic job Disney!""I know the reason why some Batman/TDK fans didn't like it because it was too overloaded, but the reason why they have to make it overloaded is because they needed money in desperation due to the automatic real life death of Joker actor Heath Ledger between TDK and TDKR.
Even if Bruce/Batman got his back-broken by Bane, sent back to dungeon and stabbed by Talia, which were all also considered bad, then that does not make this movie bad because Batman/Bruce is considered a bachelor superhero, unlike these other superheroes Clark/Superman, Steve/Captain America and Peter/Spiderman.
But the other reason why I prefer TDKR rather than TDK is because:
1.) Real-life actor Tom Hardy, who plays Bane, is still alive now.
2.) The violence in this movie is dark, gritty, intense and realistic, but not too fearfully overdone like TDK.
3.) Even if there's terrorism in this movie, that does not make this type of terrorism even fearful at all.
4.) At least I didn't see Bane nor Catwoman threatened to kill a single child in this movie.
5.) Bane killed by Catwoman than Batman is correct enough to be convincing because Bane is more of leading henchman villain and has his own supervisor, which is his partner, Talia.
6.) Batman killing Talia was also correct because we should know now that Talia is Bane's supervisor.
Stop all the hating in this movie, this movie is alright and even better than TDK, TBH, IMO!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** For me one of the few good films of the last twenty years. He went to see the movie. I've seen her at home several times. And I always remember that when I was in the cinema watching the thought, what woman, but what a bad actress is, but ... my mother, you can be a woman, you are going to give the Oscar. The film is huge in all sections. It gets you into it to the bone. It gets you in those days. You believe everything you are seeing.
Everything is real and seems to be happening at that moment. The film has an absolute truth.
The actors are all incredible. But Kim Basinger is above all others. It is like the goddess made woman who is, but also has sold her soul to the devil and asked, give me a good interpretation in my life and stay the rest. And he has granted it. Her presentation is very good, little by little, and there it is, beautiful with a touch of love and glamour.
The picture is great. It has a beautiful color, even in the street.
The management is great. It has staging, movement of characters, composition, beautiful plans. They are very well composed. But also, it is well worn, is well mounted.
The costumes are great as the makeup and the hairdresser.
I do not think you could ask for more of a movie, well yes, come back to see the.""The late Heath Ledger completely steals the show in this compellingly dark sequel to 'Batman Begins' What an extraordinary performance this is. It's rare in a blockbuster of this kind for the superhero to be only the second most important character. And to dominate, as Ledger does, almost every scene of a film that also stars Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, terrifically prowling and dynamic alpha men both of them - that's really going some. In recent years, only Daniel Day-Lewis, in There Will Be Blood, has been able to summon up anything like this toxic and intoxicating brew of energy, intensity and seductive demonism; talk of Ledger receiving a posthumous Oscar is not at all far-fetched. The Dark Knight begins with Gotham, as it always must be, on the brink of chaos. Gangsters, decked out in clown clothes in bleak near-homage to the Joker, stage a bank robbery during which they begin to shoot one another to get a larger cut of the money. Very soon, like a malevolent deus ex machina, the only clown left standing turns out to be the Joker himself. He is, it seems clear, a twisted firestarter, a self-proclaimed ""master of chaos"", a conceptual artist fuelled by a love of anarchy rather than mere money.""This movie is telling a completely different kind of skilled killer. If you love John Wick and Equalizer, you will even love this one much more.
Our killer in this movie has very depth background. They has very good way to tell few short stories, but, in the end, evolves with our Accountant in the way I can't imagine. I love the way that movie tell things and finally solve them all.
The action scenes are not too many, but filled with quality. However, like I said in the first place, this movie is very good at story telling, not just shooting scenes.
Accountant is the best movie of its kind =)""Being a film adaptation of a stage play, going into Fences with an air of caution was going to be likely for most audiences. After all, we have seen countless hit and miss attempts to bring plays to the big screen in the past and the fear was that this outing could follow a similar path. As it turns out the opposite is true, and the stripped back nature of Fences lends perfectly to the two powerhouse performances of Washington and Davis.
The very first act sets the tone for the rest of the film. Carried almost single-handedly for the first half an hour by Washington's Troy, a Pittsburgh trash collector living with the demons of his past and still dealing with the effects of 50's racism in America, the emission of flash cinematography lends perfectly to the movie's set up. We hear Troy spewing story after story, each one further exaggerated than the last, with his friend and wife in toe in his back yard. But this isn't storytelling as we're used to on the big screen; Troy's melodic, almost jazz like rifts ebb and flow much like his own life, travelling in every conceivable direction before arriving at it's end destination. It's this exceptional use of dialogue that separates fences from other failed stage play adaptations, leaving audiences hanging on every word that leaves Troy's mouth.
But Washington isn't alone in his outstanding performance and is more than adequately backed up by Davis who plays Troy's loyal and loving wife Rose who sits back quietly on the sidelines until midway through the second act where her performance really kicks in. If ever there was a line to sum up a performance then it's Roses ""What about my life? What about me?""; a line delivered with the kind of emotion and conviction that most actors will fail to achieve in their entire careers. A heart- wrenching and brutally honest assessment of her own life and ambitions spews from Rose's tongue in what is surely the film's most powerful moment.
It this kind of raw, emotive passion that makes Fences the success that it is. Sure, some will complain about the lack of cinematography or the way that Fences closely mirrors a stage production and feels that exactly that way; but that is precisely what makes the film the success that it is. A no frills, stripped down, back-to-basics set which puts the spotlight directly on the two leads and the film's two biggest assets.
Two powerhouse performances from two of the industries titans."The mind sees all... This is a beautiful message given by Kaabil. The Movie is far better than Raess which felt senseless and had a weak plot. Kaabil may not win at the box office but it surely will win a lot of hearts. The thing which i don't understand is why is it compared to Daredevil. Daredevil is a superhero with a type of sonar vision and can easily beat up 20-30 men whereas Hrithik's character struggles to beat a single guy and also that he is really blind with no sonar vision or something like that. There are some inconsistencies and it is not a perfect film but if you ignore all that you can certainly enjoy the movie. Overall worth watching. You will not be disappointed by Hrithik's performance."The story line of its Movie is really very inspiration which inspired everyone if we have the power to proof himself then no one can't stop us to go ahead.there are so many family & social issue which discourage him but he create a proper balance with them and find a common way to go ahead, the movie present its story in very strong way,after watching its movie with our incoming generation,they also ask us,is it possible ?,this is very important question which divert their mind set toward betterment. this is the story of a boy who give new Direction & set some milestones in history of world cricket ,inspired our next generation,how an leading qualities are developed in Their attitude .Movie is a very effective media which have impact on the mental assessment of our youths such healthy and inspiration entertainment is always welcomed and accepted in society.""Another zombie movie? Yes, and Yeon Sang-ho's ""Busanhaeng"" (""Train to Busan"" in English) is a cool one. The plot involves a zombie apocalypse overrunning South Korea, while a group of train passengers tries to contain the infected passengers. Just as most zombie movies give their living dead unique attributes, this one does: the zombies can't see in the dark, so they have to rely on their hearing (meaning that the living can sneak past silently when the train passes through tunnels).
It's not a masterpiece, but fun. I suspect that it's fun to play zombies, or whatever the infected people are supposed to be. The subplot about the absentee father and his daughter trying to reconnect gave the movie a more human side than most zombie movies out there. I hope that Yeon continues making movies like this.""Watching Thomas Vinterberg's widely acclaimed 2012 drama is a smarting experience because it is plain against our nature to watch a man being wrongly accused of a crime he hasn't committed, yet he has to live through its unpleasant repercussions. Lucas (Mikkelsen, in his Cannes BEST ACTOR winning role) is a divorced kindergarten teacher, a tender-hearted, restrained man who loves his work, then one day, out of blue, he is accused of sexually abusing Klara (Wedderkopp), the young daughter of his best friend Theo (Larsen). Soon, his entire life begins to unravel, and from the beginning, Vinterberg gives audience a clear view that Lucas is innocent, so by accompanying him through his purgatory, everyone in front of the screen can ask himself/herself the disheartening question, what is wrong with our society?
The first thing jumps into my mind is the disintegration of trust among people, not only among those casual acquaintances, but dear friends, it is far too quickly for Theo and his wife Agnes (Hassing) choosing the side of their daughter without trying to get the whole picture, or at the very least, give Lucas a chance to explain himself after the initial shock, he is their old friend, he deserves that, that's how fragile the bond of friendship, of trust can be broken, just by one false accusation.
Then who should be answered for this unfair deal? Klara, a precocious girl who is habitually ignored by her parents and develops an inchoate affection towards the kind Lucas, becomes intuitively vindictive when Lucas reclines her present: a heart-shape ornament she has made for him, and invents Lucas' indecent behavior to Grethe (Wold), the prudish kindergarten director. There is something uncannily disturbing in the story of Klara, in a subconscious sense and at that formative age, her premature mindset is a waking-up call for parents who take for granted of a child's inherent innocuousness, it is the bad seed which will flourish in adulthood if ignored. Yet apparently Vinterberg doesn't intend to burrow into that contentious moral compass, Klara is the origin of the misdeed, but not the culprit because she has no inkling of what kind of damage her words can cause in the first place, a chilling reconciliation scene between her and Lucas betokens a positive vibe of this dark tale.
So let's talk about Grethe, in any rate, she is shown as the main drive force behind the accusation, a woman who is so jaundiced in her preconceptions of the affair and unwisely or maybe unwittingly misconducts herself in tackling with the thorny issue, plus there is a self-congratulatory satisfaction in playing the role as a moral defender regardless of whether it is true or not, a typical canker of luxuriating in one's designated authority only to fulfill one's own self-worth in lieu of remaining dispassionate and objective. Finally, there is the self-righteous mob, blindly chooses to jump on the bandwagon as long as they can feel superiority and have someone else to pillory, a convenient and feel-good vent for their respective frustrations engendered from their respective lives, a horror has been rammed home by this compelling cautionary tale.
Mikkelsen is indubitably fascinating to watch, his harrowing gazing is searingly indelible in the climatic church scenes (which is also captured by the film's poster). All the supporting players dutifully takes on their various tasks as cogs in the wheel, in particular Wedderkopp, a very delicate role for a kid of her age, and a tangible ambiguity is amazingly elicited under Vinterberg's supervision. Established as a stalwart raconteur and a bellwether of Dogme95 movement, Vinterberg eventually finds the equilibrium between his full-grown aesthetics and biting social critique with the advent of THE HUNT, much kudos to that!""I'm so sorry I didn't make the time to see it while it was playing in theaters. I suppose I shied away from being any more jacked up about our intelligence communities than I already was. But now with the election behind us and with the possibility of Snowden being pardoned having just passed, I could summon up the courage to see a work of political art that might send me into a deep depression.
I'm not depressed having seen it now, but I am incensed. Perhaps there's been some poetic license taken but I've no doubt it's minor and beside the point. The argument is well made that Washington has gone too far and that Snowden's acts were more than warranted. The best analogy I can think of for the core issue is a father wanting to keep his daughter safe by locking her in her room. Does it work? Yes. But should any red- blooded American girl allow it? No. It's tantamount to a denial of her fundamental right to a life of her own making. Oliver Stone has given expression to the millions of progressives who have applauded the supposedly treasonous acts of Edward Snowden and in a lot of ways this is his greatest career accomplishment yet.
As a movie, the first half is fairly miraculous given the technical nature of the action. Nevertheless, what is going on is made elegantly and unmistakably clear by a score of brilliantly constructed scenes. And every established actor, and there are quite a few, seems further elevated by their inclusion in this politically risky, but near heroic, work. The second half is less impressive, but that's mostly because of the real-life, mindless acts of our elected and appointed officials.
If there's a bad side to all this, it does shed an unfavorable, but accurate, light on Obama's administration, and there's little appetite for that given our recent election.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This review contains spoilers.
Now...this was unexpected. I was utterly disgraced from The Force Awakens and just went to see a film I hoped would make up for it. I wasn't really expecting much more than an average good movie. Mind.Blown.
The movie was not perfect - I have only one thing against it - they really made the first 20 minutes kind of getting you off. But yet they were vital to the plot. I can't believe I'm saying it's just as good as Empire for me.
Now the good things. Acting was actually very good. I really thought the scene with Jyn and her father's hologram (merging with the Death Star firing) was marvelously directed and acted. Everyone made a balanced performance and everything felt real due to directing as well. I really though Edwards also managed to give some very emotional moments like the one I mentioned above and the last four minutes combined with the amazing score which surpassed John Williams' last attempt at The Force Awakens which I was very displeased with and the amazing acting and directing from that very same scene. Everything from it was just perfect and it's easily said the best scene in the whole film.
Now we were all excited about Darth Vader. I pretty much expected him not to have a lot of memorable screen time and I was wrong. Whoever was the new body actor, because I believe it wasn't the old one, did a fantastic job and really had some strong presence and no need to talk about the last scene.
I liked the new characters a lot. Erso is my fourth favorite Star Wars character. She was really well developed, was exactly what Rey should've been, had a fantastic arc and really let you wishing more and more from the character. From the trailers I judged she'd be just as bad as Rey and Boy, were I wrong... Cassian was also a pleasant surprise. He wasn't some Han Solo-like character and was something new and unique. No need to talk for K2 and Bodhi also had some development that passed by me the first time but I later saw it. Mostly - characters were likable. The movie managed to give us three villains that were all great and having some great presence. Ben Mendelsohn made a completely insane performance and managed to give us a ""deranged"" villain yet better than the ridiculous Hux from last year. Tarkin was so improved. Just the scene with him wiping out Krennic was amazing...
Overall this was a total surprise. Did not even expect something this good, it was amazing. I was looking in for a mediocre kind of satisfying film but was I wrong...I can keep talking good things about it all day.""With word of mouth, you may have all known what a big hit ""Dangal"" became lately and the critical accolades the film received. Instead of taking the promotions for granted, I insist you to watch this film first.
The film is based on a true story of an Indian wrestler, Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trains his two daughters, Gita and Babita, to win the international level wrestling competitions. It's commendable that few film makers have started to make movies on the real heroes of the country, whose tales of heroism are often unheard of. It takes a story from a small village of Haryana and takes it to an international milieu. Many are relating this movie with year's another hit, ""Sultan."" But these two films are in no way to be compared of. Though both the films are on wrestling, ""Dangal"" explores many entities like the social discrimination on girls, state of sports federation, father daughter relationships.
Where the film explores the wrestling arena from a small Haryana village to a national level training centre, the film is also filled with emotions, wit, and other finer nuances of life. Aamir Khan as usual is good, but the two girls as Geeta and Babita both were outstanding. Watched this film in theatre, and the audiences were seen applauding when the girls enter the arena and play for their country. The Haryani environment and the dialects used in the film gives it a mesmerizing touch. Just like ""Chakde India"" and ""Mary Kom,"" ""Dangal"" will remain one of the finest sports movies to come lately.
Rating: 3 stars out of 4""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Let us face it Resident Evil Movie franchise is not the best, but it is the longest running movie franchise based off of a video game. It has its ups and downs that provide elements to fans of the games and fans of action/horror genre. I no doubt enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The plot wasn't full of twists and turns and it wasn't Full of sub plots that made you go like WTF IS GOING ON?
There is one big twist in the movie but it was kind of already predictable if you listen with both your EYES AND EARS! Action sequences were amazing but blurry as if the camera man was running around maniacally with the camera to capture the best parts while fighting the villains... Also there are a few moments where it make you feel like you were playing the game such as: (Spoiler Alert). The scene where Alice faced the Flying Creature from Resident Evil 5... The whole scene references from that game in particular. Also, it does provide better scares since the previous three and gives you nostalgic moments and feelings from the previous film as well. If you've seen The first resident evil, and retribution, the Red Queen says one of my favorite lines that makes me just smile in excitement. To finish, it was great and fantastic. Fight scenes are all amazing, the movie was straight forward, a little rushed at times but quite entertaining, the final showdown is extremely phenomenal and expect Claire Redfield to throw in some action scenes as well(something I've waited for since Code Veronica). For those who've never seen it I truly hope you enjoy the movie... And to better experience the faulty movement of the cameras, PLEASE sit far away from the screen for a better visual experience! Thanks!""I have read the book ""McDonald's - Behind the Arches"" and I still liked this movie even though it covers only a part of it - or if I may say, just scratches the surface of it. Definitely watchable - especially if you haven't read the book.
Story (8/10): The story is not about the founders of McDonald's (although it talks about it as well) but the person who made it a fast food monster it is today - Ray Kroc. Shot in the backdrop of 1950s USA when the fast food wasn't so fast, Ray Kroc witnesses a revolution in a restaurant called ""McDonald's"" in San Bernardino where two brothers, Dick McDonald and Mac McDonald, are spinning out a burger, a drink, and french fries in just 30 seconds. Awestruck by the speed, the salesman inside Ray Kroc instantly identifies the opportunity to go grand with the concept which has the potential to change the food service business forever - franchise. Being a salesman, he very well knew how to convince the brothers. The rest, as they say, is history. The story depicts the persistence of Ray Kroc and his ruthless attitude to do everything it took to realize his dream, even sideline the original inventors of the concept. The writer even went one step ahead to show that, even outside his business, Ray does whatever it takes to get what he wants. As the story progresses, you realize you start feeling for Dick and Mac and develop an awkward appreciation for Ray Kroc and that's where, perhaps, the story scores. While the story spends a little time on showing what goes behind the cash counters at McDonald's, it focused on other things - the franchise model, the real business of McDonald's - real estate, personal life of Ray Kroc, and cost of not thinking big (which McDonald brothers paid). When compared to the book, the story left out many things like the McDonald's University, the quality control process and how they revolutionized the sourcing. However, that wouldn't really fit into the script, perhaps.
Acting (8/10): Michael Keaton, playing Ray Kroc, essentially took the movie on his shoulders and did a great job. His understanding of the character and the nitty-gritty is great. The expressions, dialog delivery, and the depiction of passion (or if I may say ""raw insanity"") for making McDonald's gigantic are simply brilliant. To be honest, it felt like the rest of the cast was ignored to build any strong presence in the movie. Nick Offerman, playing a ""tough-outside-timid-inside"" Dick McDonald and John Caroll Lynch, playing a ""good-guy"" Mac McDonald, did a good job but they hardly had a chance to show any kind of variety. Laura Dern, playing his wife, is good too. The rest of the cast just revolved around Michael Keaton.
Direction (7/10): Identifying what's relevant and what's not is very tough in a biopic and the director, John Lee Hancock, did a good job of it. What I loved about the movie was the amount of research done on building Ray Kroc's character. At the same time, I guess that's what went wrong as well since it essentially came at the cost of the rest of the characters. The overall flow of the movie is quite smooth, so it doesn't lose audience's attention even for a second. The climax was shot very well - especially the conversation between Dick McDonald and Ray Kroc is something to watch out for.
Overall (8/10): Overall, it's a good movie to watch if you want a glimpse of what made McDonald's. It wouldn't give you many technical details into McDonald's per se, but definitely watchable. Not a memorable movie but good enough.""I was never interested in seeing this film. This may seem surprising as I spend much of my time investigating cybersecurity. However, I had my reasons for this. First of all, I had already watched Citizenfour, the documentary on the Snowden incident. I found it mildly interesting but not compelling. Why would I want to watch a Hollywood production on the same topic? Secondly, I was suspicious about a film created by Oliver Stone. Stone seems to have an agenda that is too visible in many of his films. He's not as bad as the pseudo-documentarian, Michael Moore, but I was worried that I would get too much of Stone and too little of Snowden. Finally, why would I want to watch a movie for which I already knew the ending? I call this the 'zen of movie watching"". This is a movie you watch to enjoy the process rather than the conclusion. It can usually only be pulled off by a well-constructed movie. Death of a Salesman, for example, tells you the ending in the title. The play (or movie) shows you what events led to that final moment. Would I really be interested in seeing how Snowden ended up in Moscow, especially since I already knew the story? To get right to the point, my doubts were not justified. This was a good film. It is not simply the events shown in the documentary but more the story behind the story. The film's success largely rests on the performance of the lead actor's portrayal of Snowden. In this regard, the often under-rated, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, does a remarkable job. It has been reported that even Snowden's family praised the similarities between Gordon-Levitt's portrayal and Snowden, himself. Gordon-Levitt claimed that he repeatedly listened to Snowden's speech patterns in Citizenfour so as to get them correct. Whatever; he managed to bring the Snowden character to life.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the acting of Shailene Woodley, who played Snowden's romantic interest, Lindsay Mills. For the life of me, I could not fathom how Snowden could become so interested in such a two-dimensional woman. It was difficult to see any on-screen chemistry between the two and Woodley's stilted, robotic performance didn't help matters any. I kept hoping he would dump her and get on with his life, but, sadly, she kept interrupting the flow of the film. I can only assume that the real Lindsay Mills was much more charismatic.
In contrast, the relationships between Snowden and his superiors and colleagues is quite well done. This and Snowden's battle with his own conscience make for the most compelling elements of the film. Stone may have an agenda, but he also shows both sides of the security vs. privacy debate. If he did not, we would never fully understand the dilemma that Snowden was cast into. It is this, and not the romantic relationship, that kept me interested throughout the film.
For the average, cybersecurity-naiive viewer, much of what you see will be eye-opening. I'm sure many will not believe that what they see is true, but be assured it is. Most of all, this was an unexpectedly entertaining movie which I think most people will enjoy. I especially liked the extra touch at the end, which I will not reveal in this review.""This movie is very well done I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again. It is a pleasant experience.
It creates a world and every character in it fits perfectly into it and also takes you into the world as well that when you start watching it you feel you are transported into the ambiance and feeling the of the place it's set in.
It is also very aesthetically pleasing. Very elegant, warm, loving and beautiful. Beautiful and handsome actors, colourfully rich and interesting setting and complementing dialogues between the main characters.
There is a good balance between the simplicity of how the events unfold and the depth of emotions presented.
There are definitely room for improvement and some less interesting scenes but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie as it is.
Pitt and Cotillard do a wonderful job creating their own characters and also to create the couple that they were, makes them totally believable allowing the audience to enjoy the ebb and flow of the husband and wife dynamics.""""Ten years, thirty countries no one finds us out and we can't even last a week in suburbia."" Jeff (Galifianakis) and Karen (Fisher) Gaffney are a normal suburban couple with an average non-exciting life. When a new couple moves into the neighborhood they become friends with them, but the new couple has a secret. Now Jeff and Karen are put in the middle of a deadly high stakes deal with no idea what they are doing. First thing I have to say about this is that the movie is really funny and entertaining. There really isn't anything all that new and the movie is a little cookie cutter, but the acting and jokes make it seem fresh and exciting. The chemistry between all four of the actors is almost perfect and really helps the movie a ton. This movie won't win any awards or become a classic, but it is hilarious and I laughed throughout the entire thing. That is what a good comedy should do. I would compare this to Central Intelligence. You pretty much know what's going to happen the entire time, but you can't stop watching and laughing. Overall, a little generic and predictable but a movie that will keep you laughing and extremely entertained the entire time. This is a great watch. I give this a B+.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Brisk moving and a great story, this melodrama based on true story and holds tight to main points i would have covered this movie delivers a promise of determination and opportunity through persistence. 52 years old Ray Kroc with a long list of failures behind him (not unlike Col Sanders minus 13 years) never gives up with persistence keeps at it and finds a small McDonalds operating on high capacity and is shocked then decides to travel 1500 miles just to see it. Only point I would have mention is sad end of one of McDonalds brothers who died the day after hearing that the 1500 McDonalds was opening in town near his hometown in Concord NH. Kroc inspired by the American Dream is human, not perfect and is shown to be a liar the end and one must think adulterer reading between lines. Keaton performs adeptly as Kroc, a perfect casting. I didn't like the metaphor of McDonalds as church. McDonalds brothers do a great job too.""This movie is about family going through life's worst crap together! I think Ben Foster should have gotten a nomination too for his gritty portrayal of a big brother to Chris Pine with a shady past but so much heart! This movie has it all action, bank robberies, police chases, tender moments and a few tissue worthy scenes! The acting in this movie is a master class for all would be actors and each actor brilliantly portrays his character with detail and endearing pluck! When you route for the bad guys and the good guys equally? Well, you've got yourself an award winning movie on your hands! Highly recommend this one and the hubby loved it too!""The Dark Knight is the best movie of all time!!! Batman vs Joker. Awesome!!! Heath Ledger and Christian Bale. Best Movie of all time. If you like action and super heroes go see this movie. loved this movie!! It was great!!! Knock out hit!! They should make another Christian bale batman movie!! Ben Affleck is the worst new batman!! bring back Christian bale!! and Christopher Nolan!!! Warner Brothers bring back Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. The new batman movie is awful with Ben Affleck. The new superman is terrible too. His plastic surgery is terrible. Please Warner brothers stop making these terrible super hero movies and bring back Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan. The only comic book movie Warner Brothers made that was good was suicide squad. Will Smith was okay but the joker was the best. Make a new joker movie with Jared Leto and Christian Bale. That would be an awesome batman movie. Not Ben Affleck. Overall this is the best comic book movie, super hero movie and best movie of all time. My favorite movie. I could watch 20 times and not get sick of hit. Check it OUT""Wow, what a masterpiece!
I re-watched The Sting recently for my family who'd never seen it. The story line depicts a bunch of grifters who need to take down a big-time mobster bank in the 1930's. What an all-star cast of actors in the prime of their careers - Robert Redford as the youngster who needs schooling in the ways, Paul Newman as the grizzled veteran, Robert Shaw as the big- time mobster, and tons of superb supporting stars you will recognize.
The acting is terrific. The music is great. The plot will keep you on your seat from start to end. The Sting keeps you rooting for the underdogs throughout. This film is one of the rare gems that will be fun for young and middle and old folks alike. Except for some gun shot violence, and a little tawdry scenes with all that gambling houses offer, this film is fine for all.
Sit back and enjoy the ride. The Sting - a must see masterpiece! Enjoy.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Amateur tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wants to divorce his vulgar and promiscuous wife Miriam (Laura Elliott), so he can marry the elegant Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the daughter of a senator, and hopefully have a career in politics. On a train, Haines accidentally meets Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), who recognizes Guy from the sports pages and knows about his situation from the gossip pages. Bruno tells Guy about his idea for the perfect murder scheme: the two should ""swap murders"". Bruno will kill Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's hated father. Each murderer will kill a perfect stranger and will have no identifiable motive for his crime, and therefore they will not be suspects. Guy never imagines that Bruno means the suggestion seriously; he humors Bruno by pretending to find it amusing, but Bruno interprets Guy's response as agreement to the scheme. Guy lets Bruno light a cigarette with his (Guy's) monogrammed cigarette lighter; instead of returning it, Bruno puts it in his own pocket.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** One of those movies that makes you want to read the book. I haven't (yet) but I hear it was Kurt Cobain's favorite.
'Perfume' is stylish, original, memorable, and pretty much a perfectly executed movie. The story is magical and enthralling and moves forward in every scene, but the movie is also carried by the visuals both beautiful and ugly, and the wonderful acting. Despite remaining nearly expressionless throughout the movie, Ben Whishaw remains compelling and relatable as a sociopathic serial killer whose greatest ambition is to smell the wondrous smells of the world.
Alan Rickman, may his soul rest in peace, delivers another stand-out performance as the worried father of the prettiest girl in town (what father wouldn't know in his heart that HIS daughter is the prettiest?) who will stop at nothing to find the killer.
Metaphorical and philosophical, the movie invites the audience to think for themselves and ponder at the meaning of various things in the story, and to experience the world outside them in a completely new light.""I love this movie so much I watch it 4 times a year. The way it's written/directed is brilliant. Characters are developed beautifully and the way the story is setup is magnificent .I love how everything links up .Guy Ricthie thanks for making this film I truly love it. For me this is much better than Snatch which I also love .Enjoy this fun ride pacing is perfect . There's never a dull moment .Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did. English cinema is far more superior than American when it comes to originality and taking chances . America will never make something as gutsy as this . Cast is amazing I cannot fault any of the performances . Lock,stock and two smoking barrels is a much watch film.""Most people hopefully know the storyline is not entirely accurate (but it is based on actual events and actual people). However this movie is all about this delicious comic book style and the epicness of a long lost era.
For us Greeks it also hits a nerve as a (quite idealized) depiction of what we are taught in our schoolbooks about the Persian wars. Watching a movie with the heroes of our history makes us proud and it is a very welcome positive reference to our country especially in the context of the last years.
For all the 1/10 reviewers please relax, it is cinema, the great escape from reality. I'm already looking forward to the next one.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The story of a broken man who has abandoned all hope and feels as though he will never find a means of redemption for his sins. He finds friendship in the innocence of a child, however, and willingly lays down his life to save her; ""greater love has no one than is..."" It's been done before, but this is quite possibly the best that I have ever seen.
The reunion between Creasy (Washington) and Lupita (Fanning) at the end of this movie is, without a doubt, one of those scenes that makes any grown man with a soul and a daughter, niece, or otherwise young lady in his life that he loves dearly, tear up, no matter how thick-skinned he may be. There is no trash-talking, no epic gun-fighting, and no explosions; only a brave man accepting his fate; willingly dying to preserve her life and innocence.
This movie is, easily, a 10/10. It is a movie that you have to see before you die.""I really like Micael Curtis movies. This one stars some of filmdom's heavyweights. Mainly, James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, with Humphrey Bogart thrown in. The two are childhood friends, growing up in a tough part of the city. Cagney becomes a gangster, going over to the bad side while O'Brien becomes a priest, also going over to the bad side (just kidding). We also have the Dead End Kids who later became the Bowery Boys. Of course, at some point, the twain shall meet because of their chosen lives. As different as their lives are, they are true to themselves and there is a real love between them. Bogart plays a lawyer in the early part of his career as well. O'Brien does what he can to make things turn out for Rocky (Cagney), but the die is cast and at some point there will be a lot to pay for. This is a really good crime movie which will make you cry. Nice work.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I wonder why would I want to re-watch this movie after 15 years passed by? I've seen it right after its release and kind of just shrug it off and basically just flush it down the cinematography toilet. Was I missing a point? Did I need to mature to this movie? No. I simply needed to experience more tragedy and sadness in my life to comprehend the movie.
Let me start with a simple fact, this movie is not a typical horror that makes your heart jump and scares the s h i t out of you. This movie is about different horror. It is about horrors you experience in your life.
The movie was filmed back in 2002, directed by Mark Pellington with main cast of Richard Gere (John Klein), Debra Messing (Mary Klein), Laura Linney (Connie Mills). The story is about successful, happily married Washington Post journalist, who unexpectedly looses his wife. All that happiness between John and Mary (I wonder if this is not a reference to Peter Yates's romance) is within seconds crashed to pieces by strange car accident. We see this insect-like humanoid creature flying through the car causing his wife to freeze in fear and loosing control over the vehicle. Then drawn by unknown force only to end up in the town Point Pleasant, first by curiosity and monster chase, then by looking deeper in the basic questions of life.
I admired the mood of the movie emphasized by an excellent soundtrack, eerie and cold. Sometimes even changing to cacophony of madness. As well as by graphic effects like those little moments when picture get blurry or colors start to play games with you. Also the whole set up, scenery, was all snowy, g r e y, cold. All together giving a right touch to it. Giving you fear from what's coming next. It is like a premise to a bitter truth how we will always be afraid of an inexplicable, unknown, from things we cannot grasp, comprehend.
I think to watch, to like this movie depends on what state of mind you are. You really have to set your mood watching this. The whole movie after 5 minutes of happiness is full of darkness, despair, rage, madness, sad, g r e y and cold state of mind. But that's how the life is sometimes. Even though you have it predicted. Call it Indrid Cold, a moth-man, call it whatever you want, we are simply not capable to comprehend every phenomena using our faculties. So sometimes we simply have to accept the things as they are. Very nicely a lady cop character Connie is trying to explain to John to drop that madness and return to a normal life, to enjoy a life, to find happiness and not to dwell on sadness and despair. And he decides good, not to pick up that phone.
This said, I think this movie is not a mere monster chase. There's more to it. What can you possibly do when a bridge on which you are standing with both your feet suddenly starts to collapse. Not very much. It collapses anyway. Important is what happens after it collapses. Do I want to rebuild that bridge or just stay there the whole life looking at ruins?
Really heavy movie that introduces different kind of horror. It's about tragedies in our lives and desperate attempts to stop them or understand them. Perhaps even that is why people are trashing this movie by such low ratings. I am happy to rate this movie 8/10. Thank you.""A professor of phonetics, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) wagers that he can pass cockney street urchin Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) off as a sophisticated lady. Higgins is a confirmed bachelor, and misanthropic, especially when it comes to women, and his interest in Eliza is purely professional. However, while she is the one who is supposed to be changing, he seems to be changing too, and falling for Eliza...
Wonderful musical. You won't hear me say that often, as I generally dislike musicals. My Fair Lady is different, however. The music blends seamlessly into the dialogue, the music advances the plot, rather than just acts as padding and the music is good, giving the movie a suitable lightness and energy.
Good plot too and some great performances from Audrey Hepburn (though that's a given) and Rex Harrison.
Won the 1965 Best Picture Oscar.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** the movie is so nice to see, the chemistry between SRK & MAHIRA is fabulous. once again SRK proved he is the king of romance , MAHIRA is looking so beautiful in this movie.
dialogues are also entertaining. what to say about nawazuddin siddique, we all know about his acting he is real actor...natural actor in fact
one thing ....that MAHIRA's role should be more in the movie...she was the interesting part of the movie...after all its SRK's movie...romance is must.
heart breaking situation is the climax, SRK dies over all movie is fantastic. must watch""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Much of the film is based on the first, third and fourth books in Miller's original comic series. The Hard Goodbye is about a man who embarks on a brutal rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer, killing anyone, even the police, that gets in his way of finding and killing her murderer. The Big Fat Kill focuses on an everyman getting caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police and the mob. That Yellow Bastard follows an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured serial killer. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story ""The Customer is Always Right"", which is collected in Booze, Broads & Bullets, the sixth book in the comic series.""I didn't have this theory about ""The Princess Bride"" for years, until I came close to the age of the grandfather that Peter Falk portrays.
Here's my theory. The grandfather goes to the bedside of his grandson, portrayed by Fred Savage, prepared to do what grandfathers do - read him a story. But no, the grandson protests. Does it have sports in it? This is a silly ""yucky"" story full of kissing. Skip the kissing parts! So the grandfather decides to teach the grandson a lesson (the beginning of my theory). He takes what was probably a straightforward tale of love lost and found again, of giants and evil princes and rescues and magic spells, and embellishes it with the wisdom that can only come from living sixty years on this planet. Because, let's face it, The Princess Bride as we are told has much wisdom in it.
What are the chances that a story that has been around for a hundred years has lines such as ""You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is ""never get involved in a land war in Asia"". Only somebody who lived through the Vietnam War era (the grandfather) would come up with this. Too bad Dubya wasn't read this book as a child. Then there is the bit about the Dread Pirate Roberts - an unseen villain who turns out to be a series of villains. He would tuck Wesley into bed each night after he captured him and say ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" What other sentence so captures the sentiment of working for large corporations these days who will throw you out into the street without a backwards glance? The book hits how people believe something is real or not real based merely on their feelings about it with this zinger as Wesley carries the princess through a dangerous swamp. She cautions him about the ROUS's (Rodents of Unusual Size). Wesley's defense - ""I don't think they exist"". One immediately attacks.
And finally a great Quote: about love. An angry Prince Humperdinck after being rejected by Buttercup goes to where Wesley is about to be tortured and states ""You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say."" Only after kissing frogs for decades can I say this is so true. And on it goes.
Thus most of the wisdom of living modern life can be found in this tale within a tale, and I highly recommend it for its humor, its wisdom, and uniqueness. I don't think I've seen anything quite like it.""I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in this one. Which is frustrating, because as a whole it was actually pretty good, but there were some problems that really should not have been there. The Killing Joke is my all-time favorite graphic novel. I have read and re-read it dozens of times, so when I heard DC was making a Killing Joke movie, I was ecstatic. When I heard they got Kevin Conroy (the one true Batman) and Mark Hamill (the best Joker ever) for it? I literally ran around squeeing with joy-- and I'm a grown man. When I caught wind of the special, one-night-only event to see it in theaters? I pulled out my wallet and got tickets, because my favorite Batman thing ever was going to be a movie. It's never fair to expect perfection of a movie adaptation, so I let myself go along for the ride as it started with a Batgirl story. I nodded, thinking ""Cool, this'll set up the Killing Joke stuff that happens with her to have more emotional weight."" And it should have, but then it went in a direction I still feel very uncomfortable with every time I think about it-- spoiler: Batman and Batgirl have sex. Ok yyyy.... Yeah, no, that should only happen in the context of Dick Grayson being Batman when Bruce has disappeared. There is an uncomfortably large age gap, it's not true to the characters, and it's just weird. Even though the story keeps showing us Barbara wanting it, it's still not right because of everything about who they are as characters. Then, after that... interesting... encounter, we move into the actual Killing Joke turf. I will say that section was well-adapted and definitely worth watching. But another complaint about this movie is that the art quality was very inconsistent, and often was downright bad. Did I expect it to look exactly like the graphic novel? No. But did I want it to be at least on the higher-quality end of the scale for DC animated movies? Of course I did, and it was probably the worst looking one to date.""Back when I was younger we had a slang for certain people. It was used for people who we considered heartless or maybe someone that operated on a ""I don't give a bleep"" level. We called them cold-blooded, or cold. It was a term of endearment though. ""Man, you cold."" Like, man you're doing some stuff I could never work up the nerve to do.
That's how I would characterize this movie. Cold. Along with cold it was extremely intense. Like that hold-your-breath-so-you-can-be-aware-of-everything-that's-going-on intensity. And the pervasive musical score with the low bass chords added to the intensity.
I thought the movie was going to be a hit-man/double agent/super spy movie with extreme gadgets, extreme explosions, extreme stunts and an extreme death toll. It's not that. Or I'll say, it's not quite that. This movie went for authenticity. There's no 007/Ethan Hunt/super spy performing these miraculous fight moves, deftly killing people with the most unlikely weapon and escaping death defying situations. Upon seeing Emily Blunt (Kate Macer), I figured she'd be a super badass that would be kicking butt and taking names and could outdo even the best man. She was bad, but there was a realistic limit to her skill set.
The action was gritty, slow moving, calculated action that conforms to the rules of physics and reality. There's tactical planning on a basic level, constant communication and methodical execution of said plans. And did I mention that it's cold?
The story is a simple yet terrific one. The U.S. is stepping up its effort to curtail drugs flowing into the U.S. from Mexico with the help of an ""adviser"". This adviser has a right hand man, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), who adds an element of mystery to the entire operation. And he adds the frigidness. This man sleeps in a freezer. He drinks water and pees ice. Every scene he was in the temperature dropped. He was one cold piece of work.
The movie was masterfully done. It drove home the seriousness of the drug violence without making it look fake and superfluous. Even the subdued nature of the acting added to the quality of the film. No person was out of place or there to make a splash. This was just one of those movies where the pieces fit perfectly. Sicario has just become one of my favorites.""A professor of phonetics, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) wagers that he can pass cockney street urchin Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) off as a sophisticated lady.

You say ''is this the end, come on give me 2 hours more'' and you are being hooked on whiplash. That's some kinda awesome some kinda sad. Because whenever i watch it again i know what's gonna happen. i wish i could not know. That's what whiplash makes you. One of the best films that i've ever seen in my life. The meaning of excellent. This film. A different film from others. And J.K Simmons deserved Oscar for sure. An excellent acting. The way to teach of Fletcher is incredible.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wow. Just wow. I thought I knew enough about the crash of '08 but this film explains every angle and tells you all about the background shade leading to the robbery of the American Dream for most Americans. I knew about people buying house they couldn't afford, I knew about the garbage bonds and rigging of the etc, etc, etc. But OMG, the whole system is dirty. These people shouldn't be allowed to see the light of day if you ask me but they're living large and playing your average American into slavery. Bankers, Wallstreet 'ladies of the night' and the lot of them. The system isn't broken.. it is just working against your average American. And this movie gives you a much needed peak into the circus.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wow! Incredible and moving film. All the actors and actresses were brilliant through out. I was genuinely upset at the end.
All the other reviews were spot on so i don't feel like i need to go on.
For anyone who thinks this is just another war film, I suppose it is albeit from an angle not much of us see.
Think inglorious bast**d's but without the dark comedy slant. This Is a brutal depiction of just one of probably many efforts throughout the war. Rip to those brave men and women.
Total immersion in the film and I was genuinely upset at the end. Well done to all involved. Never forgotten.""Dear Zindagi Review-Positive Points-Few Emotional Scenes Plus Great Acting By Alia,Srk & Excellent Direction By Gauri Shinde(Cam work is good nowadays in all movies so don''t need to say. 1.Storyline Rating:7.5 Content:8 Commercialization:5.5 Entertainment:7.5 Acting Rating:7 Alia Bhatt: 4 Shah Rukh Khan: 4 Kunal Kapoor: 3 Yashaswini Dayama:6.5 Direction Rating:7.5 Music Rating:7.5 Cinematography:8 Editing:7.5 Very competent acting.

This is so functional on every level. Every piece of dialogue has purpose and is at the same time interesting, funny or impressive to say the least.
It's filled with great character arcs, and good symbolism in the costumes of the characters. Han Solo, once a scoundrel non-believer, turns into a faithful man who has seen the power of the force. His black and white costume shows that he is neither a good guy, nor a bad guy. That's why he wears different clothes in the sequel, to show his growth as a person.
I get that some criticism of this film may be that it's too mainstream, and that we've grown tired of the countless tropes this movie has, but I try to look at it with a filmmakers perspective. I see Star Wars as a very original Kurosawa homage: it's got the symbolism, the action and the same type of characters.
Conclusion: This will always be one of my favorites. It's hard to beat a film with structure as good as Star Wars, and that's why I rate this film ten stars.""""Anand"" has always been my favorite movie in Bollywood till date! The captivating and touching acting by the late Rajesh Khanna was memorable! Amitabh Bachchan played the perfect supporting actor role. The story, screenplay and direction by Hrishikesh Mukherjee for me, was undoubtedly the best by any Indian film director ever! What I liked about the film the most was the fact of how a terminally ill patient (Anand), knowing that the days in his life are limited, still enjoys every bit of it, and makes everyone surrounding him happy! The diversity shown by few supporting characters, like by the late Johnny Walker, who played the character of ""Muralilal"" was impressive! The songs were very deep in meaning and soothing. The best scene from the movie would be the death scene of Anand, played by Rajesh Khanna! 10 out of 10 stars, no doubt!""This film seems to have had mixed feedback from viewers. Professional critics loved it, but general viewers didn't seem quite so enthusiastic. Nonetheless, after having seen Psycho, I'd become an instant fan of Hitchcock, so I whacked this movie on without hesitation.
What do I like about it? Well, it has to be said that it's even more suspenseful than Psycho, with levels of psychological threat reaching such tangible heights, that the film feels all-out claustrophobic and physically grasping; very impressive.
I also like the ambiguously supernatural elements to it. You're given ample Easter eggs to try and figure out for yourself why the birds started attacking people, but there's never a resolution on that front. You're left to form your own opinions on it, and what's more, when the final scene comes to a close, unlike in Psycho, the words ""The End"" don't appear on the screen. That single editing technique may even be the most powerful aspect of the whole movie.
Yes, in horror films made before and since, we've had psychological and physical scares of more or less every description; but never have we seen one where we're not only scared while watching it, but we're also scared when the film comes to a close. When that most-ambiguous end scene passes, you leave the living room feeling as though the film itself is following you  haunting you, even; trying to get into your systems and tangle about with your sanity. The movie did that to me so well that even as I write this review, the concluding shot of the film is hanging luridly and clear as day in my thoughts. So basically, viewers of a nervous disposition: beware! Many of the characters are also very well done, being endowed with as much development as they could possibly need. Seriously, there are some scenes in this film where the characters totally blow it right out of the park. My personal highlight on that front is that scene where the main lady is in that diner, conversing with that snooty ornithologist and that hippie Bible-basher. Not a word of a lie; that scene is just, wow. First-class drama is the only term for it.
Is there anything I don't like about this film? Well, there's only a very minor patch for nit-picking, and that's the pacing. The first half of the movie is patience-testing slow, with too much emphasis on general drama.
Verdict: 99%. I prefer Psycho by an extremely slight margin, but this is still a wholly top-quality success from Hitchcock. With well-fleshed-out characters, mind-bending suspense and an extraordinarily powerful ending to rival the poignancy of all others ever, The Birds is a must.""When i first saw the trailer i said it's a must watch but i saw it yesterday,now lets start the presence of characters literally zero,bad plot bad acting even the bye bye man himself he would have made the movie good but unfortunately because the acting of surrounding people got him in the legs and him bad eve Jacob trembley's sister was in it that was one of the reasons i was so excited the screenplay was shitty really shitty so as directing,they have to make a sequel to make a good movie like they did with Ouija i wanted to love it but no this 2 grades just for jump scares a bad shitty plot bad makeup good costumes and decoration the problem with the screenplay is that it left big Questions left and silly things and i wont forget the bad silly acting of every single person in this i wanted to adore it but sorry i can't Lie and Say its good or not bad""WOW, what a waste of time. I convinced myself to watch this no-brainer. Nothing against ""popcorn"" cinema in general. I love watching some action-packed well made movie once in a while. But, what a piece of garbage this one is, and frankly not (as I feared) because of Ben Affleck as Batman. He actually did the ""best"" acting. But if you have Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther, Henry Cavill as Superman, or Jeremy Irons as Alfred... wtf? Is this a movie about worst choice for a role? ...it's like putting liberal idiot ""scientist"" Neil deGrasse Tyson in a movie ...oh wait.
The story line, if you can even call it like that, has huge gabs and leaves lots unexplained, almost as the producers wanted to tell everything about both main characters but in the end failed by focusing on trivial stuff. This doesn't do either Batman nor Superman any justice.
On the good side, I'm now at a level where I actually might try to watch the Ghostbusters remake, just to have something truly awful to wipe this from my mind.""I cannot believe this was a Tim Burton film. It seems like he only was paid to put his name on that monstrosity. Awful direction, awful photography, i won't say anything about acting, it was really unlucky. I haven't read the book, since i saw that Burton was going to make this film, so i was patient to enjoy one more of his wonderful works so far. Since when you decided not to be an artist Mr Burton? Since when you decided to care only about money? I could not stand to watch it till the very end, it was worst than the league of extraordinary gentlemen. I am giving 2 stars out of 10, and i believe it is too much.Next time he decides to sell his name, he should be more wise. Not again, Mr Burton, please, not again.""When you combine The Sixth Sense, Prometheus, A Beautiful Mind and Independence Day with coffee cup stains you arrive at err umm 'Arrival'! With a plot as solid as a soap bubble, we can but wonder, how it got nominated to the Oscars. The number of coffee cup stains you see on the screen is the number of movies it has derived inspiration from.
Except for one scene that shows gravity drag, there was nothing impressive about the film (not a spoiler, it's on the trailers). If shivering can qualify as acting and a didgeridoo sounds alien, we can't help, but judge the imagination of the Director.
After half a century, Hollywood has finally gotten bored of portraying Russia as it's arch enemy and have elevated China to this post. This movie would have been complete if they had thrown in some robots and zombies.""I am being generous with a 3/10. This film is just empty, hollow, blank... Nothing ever happens.. It gets cheesy quite a lot. Characters are bland, there is no chemistry between them. I actually wanted to go out but felt sorry for my money, and then got sorry for my wasted time... I never got to care for anyone in this film... Don't believe the hype because this is one forgetful movie which you will never want to see again, not even on TV. There are many illogical scenes that make you wonder what they were thinking, and that is only food for thought there is. I only liked costumes and scenery, some fighting scenes were kind of fun, but we've seen it many times in many other fantasy films.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There could possibly be two miracles in this film, first will be the miracle on the Hudson and the second will be your ability to watch it all the way to the end. What a boring film, not to take away from Sully's amazing feat but this would have been much more suited to a short 10min film than a feature.
A film filled with padding to stretch it to feature length. Let's watch Sully go for a jog, let's watch Sully sit in a hotel room and think, let's watch Sully sit in a bar. The fact that you watch the landing in full twice really shows the amount of scraping necessary to get it over the line. Tedious.""Two young Jesuit priests travel to 17th-century Japan, where Christianity has been outlawed. The priests wish to verify whether their mentor has apostatized, but end up facing their own crises of faith. Silence is a huge disappointment, mainly because the main premise, a young priest having a theological crisis in the horror of Godless Japan, does not transfer well to screen. It may well be riveting in the original novel, but the interior world of Garfield does not sufficiently become exterior. This despite ample narration from the protagonist himself, and the bizarre introduction in the last 20 minutes or so of an as yet unseen character, a European merchant whose heavy-handed exposition is, I suspect, intended to close the narrative in a way the images and momentum to this point have failed to do. Garfield performs well, Liam Neeson is reduced to a cameo, and Tadanobu Asano is similarly under-used. An implicit critique of Christian missionary in foreign lands is under-developed. What the Japanese made of these interlopers would be worth exploring, but the film shows little interest in the Japanese point of view. For the first time ever, I was bored by a Scorsese film. Silence is dull, and lacks vision.""I have enough money in my wallet to bankroll this. This reminded me of a Speed Racer show, fake cars coming out the shoot and it got worse. After 10 minutes I was poking myself in the eye. Canned music, Mad Max costume knock offs. This was bad and the acting was worse. How anyone could watch this entire movie was beyond me. Malcolm McDowell must need money very badly to do this. They used Can-Ams with fiberglass kits for the cars. Very low budget and they did have some quality actors in this who took these roles for some unknown reason. I will acknowledge they used green screens to their advantage. This would be a great $10 video game for the Nintendo.""Tom Ford is a real filmmaking prodigy. With just one previous directorial effort under his belt (2009's surprisingly sensual ""A Single Man""), Ford has shown exceptional talent handling actors, and he has a definite eye for composition, location shooting and how long a scene should play...what he lacks is supervision. A gallery executive, fraught with weak finances and a shaky marriage, receives the final draft of a novel her ex-husband has written. She becomes absorbed by the gruesome story of a man who loses his wife and daughter to southern yahoos in the desert--and comes to see how the painful prose is relevant to her own house-of-cards existence. ""Nocturnal Animals"", adapted by Ford from Austin Wright's novel, ""Tony and Susan"", features tightly-controlled, anguished performances from its talented cast, but is long on repellent or inscrutable detail (a mysterious car pulling up to a security gate, a paper cut bleeding like a deep wound, a naked man sitting on a toilet--and wiping himself in a tight shot), as well as cheap shots, such as a ghostly ""boo!"" coming from a baby monitor. The movie, filled with unhappy and sometimes repulsive people, is certainly a polished piece of work open to interpretation, but perhaps a more judicious editor could have eliminated Ford's unnerving penchant for excessiveness. ** from ****""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Gosh, I generally love Tim Burton films, but what happened here? Much was changed from the book, and I would say every change was for the worse! Too much CG, bad acting, implausible plot hang-ups! As one other reviewer noted, the whole feel of the book was changed from magical and timeless (the book) to forced and clumsy (the movie). Halfway through the movie, the whole plot is changed from the book to a dopey amusement park scene where all the snot-nosed, peculiar kids with quirky powers ""gang up"" and defeat ferocious, powerful and supernatural monsters and their sidekick half human cohorts. Kind of like Home Alone meets Aliens--LOL! What the ! If you have loved and admired the book(s), you might want to stay away from the movie--why Mr. Burton tried to ""fix"" something that was not broke is beyond me!""No matter the genre, a second film in the franchise is always expected to up the ante. Whether that entails expanding the scope and scale or just developing your characters to a new point of awakening is up to each film individually. Resident Evil Apocalypse adds nothing new to what the first film already established. In fact, besides a slight setting change and some new faces, this is the exact same movie.
It's unfortunate that Milla Jovovich got so tied up with the Resident Evil films for all those years. She's a talented actress, and quite good in the movies, but she's never given much to do besides wear inappropriate clothing (especially in an apocalypse) and throw some punches. Alice's character arc is the same as the first film. She initially finds herself estranged to her surroundings, she finds companions, punches are thrown, guns are shot, bad people try to take her and shake her world to the core, and then she revolts. It's quite laughable.
For whatever weaknesses the first film had, at least it felt original and grounded with reality. 'Apocalypse' has a ton of action and new set pieces, both of which may wow the casual film-goer, but those sequences are constantly tied down by fast and lazy editing. A lot of films in the mid-2000's fell victim to jump cut fight scenes where you don't actually know who's punching who, you just get caught up in the excitement. With 'Apocalypse', not only do you not know who's punching who, you honestly don't care where the punches are landing anyway. It's not that I overtly disliked any of the new characters we were introduced to, such as Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivera, Angie Ashford, L.J., or Terri. But I found nothing unique or interesting about them, especially compared to the original gang in the first film.
Sure, Jovovich is always entertaining to watch as Alice, but with nothing new added since the last outing, I can't possibly give the film a positive review.
+Jovovich keeps it watchable
-Lazy editing
-Rehashed plot
-Nothing unique about the new team
4.4/10""There is no one Robin Hood story, just an accretion of folk tales, antiquarian speculation and literary invention. The Saxons versus Norman theme was an anachronism that originated with Sir Walter Scott. The story can legitimately be set in the time of Richard and John, of Simon de Montfort or of any of the first three Edwards. Robin can be a yeoman, as in the ballads, or he can be an earl fallen on hard times, as the Elizabethan playwrights had it. He can inhabit the realm of history or, increasingly in modern retellings, that of fantasy. He can be a merry trickster or a grim guerrilla fighter. The only constant is that Robin Hood is an outlaw.
Except in this version. Well not until the last five minutes, anyway. This it is claimed is an origin story: the story of how the Robin became an outlaw. The problem is that the actor playing Robin is too long in the tooth for a prequel, why he is outlawed is never really made clear and the plot, such as it is, has no particular connection to any story element associated with Robin Hood. Just a few characters with the same names. Not that Robin himself is ever actually called Robin Hood.
So what is this film? An action adventure story, in which playing fast and loose with history can be excused because we are on a helter skelter ride of thrills? Nah, it is far too plodding for that. An historical drama then? Well in that case some grounding in real events seems to be a prerequisite. I don't really know where to start on the historical inaccuracies. But let's start right at the start. Richard did not die on his return from the crusades, he had already been back to England and was campaigning to secure his lands in France. The castle he invested at Chalus-Chabrol was defended by just forty men of whom only two had real any military training. But Ridley Scott needs to reassure the audience that this is going to be a full-blooded epic (because the next hour and a half is going to be really dull) so the siege becomes a major production number with Richard struck down in the thick of the frantic action. Rather than, as history records, being hit by a lucky potshot and lingering on to die of gangrene in his mother's arms.
After that, well actually after that any resemblance to history flies out of the window, with vague, incoherent references to Magna Carta and the First Baron's War being tossed into a stew of anachronistic ingredients that barely bubbles to a simmer. For me the most precious moment was when the turncoat Godfrey begins speaking to Phillipe Augustus in French, and the King says, 'In English, please.' The King of England couldn't speak English let alone the King of France!
Okay, you can rely on the average audience having a tenuous grasp on English history, English audiences not least, but this is the most geographically challenged Robin Hood film since Kevin Costner took the rolling English road to Nottingham by way Hadrian's Wall. Or perhaps the producers of this film had a different Nottingham in mind, since the Nottingham here appears to be a seaside Hampshire village rather than a heavily fortified midland stronghold.
Some effort is made to get the material culture correct, but it always bemuses me when the producers of historical dramas lavish immense care and cost on authentic costumes and set dressing, and the script is then entrusted to a hack who can't be bothered to do even the most basic Ladybird book level research. Having the peasants playing Celtic folk rock at their celebration did in any case rather detract from the carefully constructed medieval ambiance.
So we have a story not set in real time, not set in the real world and not grounded in myth. Just a jumble of badly integrated plot elements, topped and tailed with some tacked on action sequences.
It is a film without point, without purpose, without soul.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** How the *** can this be for 12 years and older?! There are closeups of penises in this movie.
This should be in the adult section!
That stupid penis-scene does not even add anything to the movie. The rest sure is PG12. I don't see why that pervert scene is in this otherwise enjoyable movie. We liked it, particular the slapstick, the unexpected crazy narratives and the over the top Bond-style. Altogether well worth seeing.
I vote a 1 just because you can not allow children to look at mens erect private parts.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** What I'm starting to notice about these Despicable Me movies are how they put the best jokes in the trailers and everything else in the actual film usually s@cks unless you're a five year old kid who can never get sick of the minions talking in gibberish. This is a four out of ten stars kind of movie but I'm giving it just one star to help offset the current ranking. I swear, people love to give the stupidest movies ten out of ten stars if it can make them laugh just once. And that is why this film is near garbage. I know, I know.. this movie is made for kids but, is it really? It has, or tries to have a bit of adult humor but it fails. I swear I'm not going to pay a penny to watch anything by these directors.""I remember how a sketch from an early episode of ""MADtv"" featured Jason Voorhees IN SPACE! I wonder how the creators of that sketch felt when this movie was released. Okay, it wasn't exactly the same, as this movie takes place in the future. I remember looking up Leonard Maltin's movie guide and being amazed at the sheer number of slasher films that his book seemed to be cluttered up with! I think ""Friday The 13th"" has the most numbered sequels of anything in his book. It was weird looking up plots and finding out the villains died in the last movie. Every single one of them is back!
It was bad enough that they lied to us with ""Friday The 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter"". Then they lied AGAIN with ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday"". It looks like this is still the last canonical appearance of Jason in this timeline, although they simply made a remake years later. It's weird how they attempted to make the formula different in the last couple of movies. It's a pity they were just as dumb as the originals, if not worse. Anyway, this film features Jason being frozen for hundreds of years and then terrorizing the people on a spaceship. It's weird to see how these supposedly genius scientists are every bit as stupid as the kids on Crystal Lake.
They just get killed off over and over like the dumb teenagers hundreds of years ago. I guess you could argue Jason simply became more powerful, but still they should know better. I was amazed at how awful the CGI was in the training simulation. I guess that might have been intentional, seeing as how it was a simulation, but it still looked hideous. We even got to see these guys die twice. I'm glad I watched this on Friday the 13th even if it wasn't in the title. I saw it on the Syfy Channel and honestly, it fit right there with their cheesy movies. *1/2""The original TV version was outstanding. This version was a sequel to the Hammer version starring Daniel Radcliffe.
Too many scenes were so dark as to obscure what was happening. The general gloom reduced the atmosphere rather than adding to it.
Scriptwriting lacked a clear dynamic. The original story by Susan Hill was a classic ghost story and provided a credible premise for the haunting. It should be possible to build on this, but unfortunately this sequel failed to do this. Ostensibly, all the ingredients were present, but... well, it takes more than an old neglected house and a bunch of wartime child evacuees to make a spooky film.
Too episodic in plot to be effective. Overall short on tension and thrills.""Im really sorry i wasted 1 hour and half of my life on this, total waste. This is the worst movie i have ever seen, words haven't even been invented yet to describe it. The acting is really bad, it doesn't even feel like Keanu, and the rest of the cast is just doing so bad . But the worst thing is how ridiculous and unrealistic things happen. Many things are overly exaggerated and painful to watch.
This is my first review ever, i had to do it so people can be warned. Biggest let down from Keanu Reeves, avoid this at all costs!If you have a brain this is not for you!
Complete waste of money in the making of this movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Here's an in-depth summary of the movie:
Main character uses time travel to get a girlfriend, then we spend the rest of the movie watching his boring life play out.
There, I just saved you 2 hours.
The acting is bad, the characters are flat, the comedy isn't funny, and the story (if you can call it that) is a boring waste of time. Based on its current IMDb score (7.8), I would say this is the most overrated movie of all time.
Anyone interested in a good time travel movie (as I was), don't even bother.""As to how this movie became a cult favorite is beyond me ..
This film not only lacked in imagination and was filled with dull moments, but there was nothing tense nor suspenseful about it.
The special effects were good enough for its times, and the ambiance was fantastic and essentially the plot focused on paranoia is a good one..but here lies the problem ...
The suspense and tension was not cleverly executed, it was dragged down making only the top notch special effects pop.
The film did not have a single female character which could have added a romantic element, no absolute humor and no fear factor aside from the ugly 'thing'.
Bored through most of this dragged dull mess i regret investing a single second. Alas, its done and so please learn from me : Don't watch it or you'll be bored to death.
I just can't seem to be a john carpenter fan ... i get disappointed with all his films.
Final Grade C-""This movie is basically the same as any other karan Johan movie, kal ho na ho, Kuch kuch hota hai, etc. All of these movies basically have the same story line. It always has to be a love triangle. Just because the movie has sharukh khan, aishwarya and ranbir in it doesn't mean the movie has to be good. When I turned this movie on thinking it was gonna be great and all, halfway through the movie and yet there was no story they were just going places acting like idiots. It was nothing new and exciting. My husband didn't even know who directed/produced this movie but 30mins into the movie he said ""I bet karan Johar made this movie"" and it was true. movie had good actors but story was such a clichè""So glad I didn't pay to see this mess in theaters. I love key & Peele's sketch comedy and throw in the always beautiful Nia Long for good measure and you have my attention; plus, I'm a cat lover to boot. All that said, as others have noted this thinly plotted violent comedy is just a series of sketches that drag on way too long. This would have made a funny 30 minute special episode. But at 100 minutes, it's just one over-long scene after another. Yes, there are other things Key and Peele are trying to do in addition to the laughs. But a comedy is first and foremost judged on being funny, not a chore to sit through.
Let's just forget this first (and hopefully not the last) feature film outing from this duo and remember them for a great TV show and fitting send off for Pres. Obama.""This is an amateur rush job with incoherent unnecessary elements that jut out like sore thumbs - worthy of a cartoony loony tunes effort that almost parodies the more seamless and logical story lines of earlier Alien - and Aliens, and dares to ride cheap on their coat tails. Naomi is utterly miscast. Her English accent is a cardboard papier mache type. Guy Pearce is superfluous. Matching Naomi in cosmic hamminess is Idris Elba's acting - woefully wooden. The twists and turns have all the impact of broccoli gloop on a cold plate. Fassbender might as well not have bothered. Badly edited, silly story line and wasted opportunities. Let's hope prometheus II - covenant is better bowled.""Someone I know who hadn't seen any good films said this was his favourite ever movie. Unsurpisingly it was not very good. He should have watched Star Wars when he was a kid instead of this incoherent nonsense. Here are some reasons its not very good.
1. The plot is dumb. 2. The action is forgettable. 3. The dialogue was all over the place.
Some positives;
1. Kurt Russell is always entertaining.
That's about it.
Overall I'd say of all the John Carpenter films I've seen, this was the worst. Halloween and The Thing are a lot, lot better.""An American remake of an Oscar winning film from Argentina with a decent cast misfires and bores the audience to death with a misguided effort. I've never seen the original film, but I know it has to be better than this wreck.
In the aftermath of 9/11, the watch on terror is at an all-time high. Two counter terrorist agents, played by Julia Roberts and Chiwetel Ejiofor are called to a crime scene because it is suspiciously close to a mosque they are keeping tabs on. The crime scene involves a dead body in a dumpster and coincidentally the dead person is the daughter of Roberts. Ejiofor becomes obsessed with tracking down her killer. Plastic face Kidman also stars.
The film is split between two timelines. 2002, when the body is discovered and more than a decade later when Ejiofor is still on the case, off the books. He's no longer part of the unit, but he seems to be the only one who cares about finding the guy who once got away. Ejiofor sells the obsession of the case, but fails to connect with Kidman when the film forces a love story between them. Kidman doesn't do much to help him in this situation, she delivers a wooden performance in an underwritten role.
The film tries to be clever and pull a fast one on the viewer, but anyone who has seen a film before can connect the dots well before the film ever reveals anything. Poor writing aside, the director, Billy Ray doesn't seem to be able to thread a suspenseful case with this story. One scene in particular takes place at a baseball game and a chase ensues. How is this not even the little bit suspenseful? Poor camera work and editing come into play as well, they seem amateurish.
At no point, did I care about either timeline, nor the character decisions. I can see an interesting story here and I can only assume it was told masterfully in the original film, here it is uninspired. A real shame, since American remakes haven't fared to well.""I never write on the internet, and yet, here I am. The movie is simply horrible, tacky and terrible acting. Don't even bother. According to the guidelines, my review does not contain enough lines, as the minimum length for reviews is ten lines of text. The problem is, there's nothing more to say. Acting is crap, story line is crap, casting is crap, everything is so far fetch... typical American movie where everything can happen. This is simply not realistic and not interesting at all. I'm so happy I didn't pay to see that movie now available on Netflix. The movie was so boring that I even took the time to look at tomorrow's weather on the weather network. Seriously, don't watch. It is simply not worth it. Here's my ten lines...""The original was so good. I mean really good and I'm happy I already knew it, because this remake would have ruined it all. Underwhelming would be an understatement. It really takes a good concept tries to run with it, but never really touches the viewer or gets you to the edge of your seat. Well maybe once or twice, but even then the moments were much bigger in the original.
And it's not down to the actors, they do their best to convey emotions and carry the story as good as they can. But just more or less copying the original (some minor tweaks, like the terrorist thread America was really afraid of after 9/11, which some would say is being used in a shameful or clever way, depending on your view of things), is not really helping the cause much. Watch the original! I beg you! There is a reason it was at the Oscars (they do get it right from time to time)""Blind side? Who was actually blind were those who gave Bullock an Oscar for this. I mean, I'm not saying she didn't perform well, she actually did, but how is this worth an Oscar?!
This film is the definition of stereotyped, feel good, American film. I already knew how it was going to end after 40 minutes. It almost felt forced, cringe-worthy at some points. Perfect white family, Christianity, stereotypes of black people and projects, they even threw in some Republican politics.
And it's not even close to the facts, to the real story of Michael Ouhry.
Fortunately...""Late-WW2, Allied-occupied Italy. A nurse at a field hospital is tending to a badly burned English pilot. He has no identification so is referred to as ""The English Patient"". Slowly she starts to piece together his background, including a passionate yet doomed romance with a married woman.
9 Oscar wins, including Best Picture. You have got to be kidding! I really don't know what all the fuss was about, as the movie is pretty dull. Empty, style over substance and pretty much schmaltz for schmaltz sake. One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners.
It wasn't like it was such a bad movie year - you had Fargo, Jerry Maguire, Sling Blade, Trainspotting, The People vs Larry Flynt, all of which are infinitely better than this.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The new Hollywood musical with the intriguing title ""La-La-Land one of the most talked about motion pictures in recent years with two of Hollywood's most attractive and popular younger generation stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, can best be summed up in a single three syllable word ~~. PA-THE-TIC!
-- Gosling, in spite of a name that makes one think of goose liver, is indeed quite handsome in the traditional Hollywood leading man mold, but when it comes to acting or personality he is no Cary Grant or Jimmy Dean, and as far as dancing goes he couldn't carry the jock strap of either Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire. His love interest and dancing partner, Emma Stone, a lissome (skinny) redhead with gigantic blue eyes, and no breasts to speak of, is a much better dancer, and generally a far better actor, but seems to have aged considerably since her extraordinarily vivid interpretation of a sexy young college co-ed in love with her murderous philosophy prof in Woody Allen's ""Irrational Man"" just two years ago. In this picture she is in facial closeup much of the time but looks haggard, worn, and older than she is supposed to according to the story. The dance numbers seem to be an attempt at a homage to Astaire and Ginger Rogers in slow motion, but they are so badly set and choreographed that after a while they just become annoying. One particular Gosling Stone duet set in the L.A. Planetarium is so ridiculous with them antigravitationally traipsing on thin air against a galaxy of stars that it is downright embarrassing. The young lovers are clearly meant for. each other but their divergent career dreams and aspirations, she as an actress he as a Charley Parker type serious jazz musician, keep them apart in the wake of arbitrary script manipulations that seem so phony you get the feeling the actors had to keep asking themselves, ""Hold on a sec --what were we supposed to be doing in that last scene?"" Pathetic scripting, pathetic unmotivated dance scenes arbitrarily inserted, then ineptly executed -- pathetic unfocused direction - no wonder Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) have such pained expressions on their pretty faces all the time. I actually felt sorry for Emma in some scenes suspecting that she may have been physically unwell while going through the motions. I kept looking at my watch wondering if this thing was ever going to end. The running time was 128 minutes but it felt more like five hours. The final credits with handsome art-deco lettering were a great relief when they finally came up and put this picture out if its misery. No more Damien Chazelle for me. He also directed another sado-masochistic abomination entitled ""Whiplash"". Give me Mondo Cane ... Bottom line: A film almost as dopey as its dumbbell La-dee-da title.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** he video game adaptation franchise finally concludes but not on a high not, just another mediocre film that has not succeeded at the domestic box office. Alice (Milla Jovovich) survived the war in Washington D.C. and roams the streets. She hasn't seemed to learn from her five other movies, still walking into traps and finding herself in trouble. Alice ducks, flips, and shoots her way out of dire circumstances on more than one occasion. The action would be a lot more fun to watch if there weren't some many cuts that make for confusing action and hurts the narrative, a signature of Paul W.S. Anderson's directing style.
The story revolves around the mission the Red Queen gives Alice to cure the T-Virus infection with an airborne antivirus that remains in the bottom of the hive from the original film. The movie, like the others, insists on filing the information from the beginning and adding to the story. In this past, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) conspired to orchestrate the outbreak in a biblical delusion hoping to bring about a figurative flood from the story of Noah's Ark. Alice is kidnapped by Dr. Isaacs, who claims that she only killed a clone back in the third film. The doctor is also heading back to Raccoon City in an armored truck trailed by an army of undead.

Executive 1: Have you watched Monster Jam recently?
Executive 2: No. I don't watch that stuff
Executive 1: My little boy was playing with his Hot Wheels and asked about a movie.
Executive 2: You think kids will go for it?
Executive 3: Have you seen their toy profits? A film would be a cash grab!
Executive 2: We don't own the rights to either Hot Wheels or Monster Jam
Executive 1: That's okay, we can just fictionalize it
Executive 2: But we can't just show monster trucks for an hour and a half
Executive 1: Hmm what if we incorporated it into a robot story?
Executive 2: You mean like Transformers?
Executive 1: Ohyour right. Too similar. How about an alien?
Executive 2: Like E.T.?
Executive 1: Exactly! Our hero will find him in the truck, and the alien will be able to move the car around like a monster truck.
Executive 2: I like it! It could end with a bunch of monster trucks doing the same thing.
Executive 1: We'll call it Monster Trucks!
Executive 1 & 2: Greenlit!
In North Dakota (which it's clearly not with mountains and lakes in the setting), a high school student Trip (played by Lucas Till) works at a junkyard to save up for his dream to simply leave. Meanwhile at a nearby oil drilling site, an underground water system is discovered that also unleashes a monster of some kind. Manager of the oil site, Reece Tenneson (played by Rob Lowe) orders for the creature to be found to prevent the press to find out about the fracking about to be pulled off illegally.
While working to getaway from his mother Cindy (played by Amy Ryan) and her boyfriend sheriff Rick (played by Barry Pepper), Trip discovers the creature that he names Creech. The squid-like monster turns out to be playful, like a kid version of it's species. Trip also sees that Creech like to hide out in a truck that he's been working on. He and fellow student Meredith (played by Jane Levy) manage to out run the oil companies security firm when they come looking for the creature. Tripp makes a bunch of adjustments to his truck so that Creech can make high jumps, wall climbing, and pretty much anything to make it a monster truck.
Where do I begin with this one? It's said that this film had been sitting on the shelves at Paramount Studios and I can see why. Apart from having a creative but standard story, the choices made are strange. Both actors playing our high school leads are clearly in their late twenties, so I don't know why they simply didn't change the script to make them college-aged. Even if that was the case, both have little to no personality which makes them boring to watch. The majority of the performances are stale, including an underused Rob Lowe.
You must think that Monster Trucks must be one of the worst movies right? WellI'll say that I was disappointed. Not because I had high expectations, but lower ones. Creech does have a lot of personality and even some of the truck stunts are fun to look at. I think that if I was seven, I would have gotten a kick out of it. The problem is that the film is clearly made for kids, and if I had a child that wanted to watch it as a time killer, I wouldn't object as it doesn't have any bad morals; just a premise that adults will simply find too juvenile.
I'll give this two monster trucks out of five. Honestly, the film is meant to be kids entertainment rather then family entertainment. It knows what its for and tries to give it's audience a fun time. I certainly didn't, but the kids in my theater seemed to enjoy themselves. I'd say this is something to save for Netflix or ITunes rather then the movies. Let the kids start their engines and the parents can stay in the garage.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** How anyone can take 100 million dollars, a tremendous cast and the characters of one of the all-time great children's' books and get this tedious drivel is beyond me. The moment I realised that the opening 'pirate adventure' was not just a dream sequence but rather the 'reality' side of some new post-feminist iteration Alice's life, I knew that I was going to hate this movie  and it did not let me down. All I can hope for is that the dismal returns on Disney's investment guarantees that the studio won't desecrate another classic. Wishful thinking I'm sure - they didn't learn anything from John Carter. There is a reason why people still avidly read these books a century after they were written - they are that good - they don't need to be rewritten, updated, have their characters co-opted or their name and tradition exploited.""It seems that a lot of the complaints come from people who expected an action movie. But not every alien movie has to be that ! So if you like the other kind, slow paced, low-key, intellectual... then go watch Contact.
Arrival draws a lot from Contact : themes, pace, plot elements. Both are stories where the big alien encounter mostly serves as a device to explore the psyche and emotions of a single human : the female lead role.
At times, Contact managed to make you ponder about science and faith. In the end, Arrival, with more sets and more CGI, and a gripping dark atmosphere, will mostly make you think about its plot holes and shortcuts.""Believe me I love Trainspotting..It is a master piece...but this was some disjointed crap with no storyline...Begbie's character was inconsistent and a parody of himself...the rest of the movie was literally clips taken from the original movie and spliced in like a shitty ""compilation"" TV episode where there is no budget so they use old clips...
I didn't buy any of the relationships between the characters like Renton and Sick boy...
And what happened to the sauna idea? they start of a great sequence where they are building a brothel and then ooompff...just disappears
kinda slow and boring to top it off...and the lack of budget really shows""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This film is ridiculous from the beginning. It's a story about an egocentric, especially strong Super-Woman. Nobody needs such sluts! Another Try to build a female Terminator. Another Try to impose feminism to the society. Another part in the propaganda-puzzle, to destroy traditional families and support lesbians as a normally alternative of partnerships. That's the way to make politics today. You maybe only see an Action-Movie, but the secret messages are going directly in your subconscious. Believe it or not. Hollywood makes politics, since decades. It wont take a long time and the first propaganda-movie against Donald Trump will appear in the cinemas."".... of boredom.
A rating of 7 means that brain dead zombies are now rating films at IMDb.
The directors were real geniuses, they could make a zombie film that is slow moving, tedious, insipid and without scares.
The little actress is pretty bland, Glenn Close was miscast and the pseudo-scientific explanation for the zombie epidemic is very unsatisfying.
It was very hard to stay awake throughout the film.
On one thing the directors succeeded, after a while watching this bore fest, one's brain function shuts down and we all start behaving like zombies.""very mediocre and totally unforgettable songs sung by actors not singers. Not good dancers trying hard with bad choreography, story is pitifully bland with no real credible plot and an even worse ending. I know many people have rated this highly far too highly in my opinion, but to balance that I have heard from many people who were so very disappointed and some even left during the film.. The 1/10 is because of the very high mark it has maybe I should have given a more reasonable mark 2/10 mo more, just over 2 hours of my life lost that I cannot ever get back.... I think maybe it is a ""Kings new clothes"" where people just follow the bandwagon frightened to say LA LA Land the movie was and still is pretty bad...""You are probably not going to see this film for riveting story-lines and in depth character studies. The RE series has about action and fun sequences. Leaving aside all the ridiculous plot points and lazy screen writing, the editing of this movie is going to become legendary for it's awfulness.
I've never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie. Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4 camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so it's impossible to follow what's going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to figure out what's happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes 5-6 edits and quick cuts?
Bring the puke bag.
I guess they tried to film some neat locations and the costumes are pretty and sets, but you wont even notice with the multiple edits jarring your eyes.""Good night every one.
I give a 3 stars to this movie, out of pity, because in my opinion it deserves a -3.
How could you, Matt, accept to work in such a... melé of monstrosities?
It is a melange of horror, scifi of the worst quality, disconcerting adventures, bad script, nonsensical situations, and exuberant beasts, by more tons, that MGI can put in ten movies of the Jurassic times. It's like millions of ants running away from their burning nest. Only the beasts of this movie have the size of a whale.
All in all we can add to this lunacy the very advanced defenders of the Wall, more valiant than Wonder Woman with artifacts of war that the Russians would had paid in gold to have for their Revolution. That is what I saw in this film, other people might boo me.
Blessings!

C*""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie depicts only the incident on the oil rig. The real disaster, the catastrophic consequences on the environment are not taken into the story line. I was expecting much more. You can learn a lot watching some videos on youtube.
Most important part of the story seems swept under the carpet and hidden to the audience.
The topic is so critical and the result is so outrageous that everything about screenplay, the acting, the visual effects, are not worth to be judged.
So disappointing that makes me angry. 3 stars, because after all is a good disaster movie. If it wasn't a true story it could be a 6.""Perhaps the idea was to make a movie in the style of a funeral cortege, as one long, slow lament. If so, writer Noah Oppenheim and director Pablo Larraín have succeeded. The result, though, is a ponderous, portentous, heavy-handed film, illuminated by Nathalie Portman's star turn as Jackie Kennedy. She is stunning, and is ably supported by Peter Skarsgaard, Billy Crudup, John Hurt and Greta Gerwig, among others. But when a cast like this, with a central performance as good as that, can't prevent the enterprise from sinking under the weight of its pretensions, there's not a lot to be said in mitigation. Mica Levy's Oscar-nominated score is among the casualties: beautiful music, which will sound great on an album I've no doubt, but it doesn't help the film escape its weary slog towards the end credits. Madeline Fontaine's costume designs, which also got an Oscar nod, are fortunately free from the obsequies.""This is not a horrible movie and you're capable to see it through, but absolutely nothing more. The idea is kind of cool and the story could work. The problem is that it's poorly made and some of the acting is awkward. They tried to be deep and have a secret motive, but it ends up flat. Instead you end up with something that only is weird and doesn't make any sentence. But i must say that both Will smith and Edward Norton does a okay job and tries, but their mediocre performances can't save this move. I usually like Edward Nortons work, but I guess good actor can do bad movies to. Wouldn't recommend the film, but if you do see the film. It wouldn't be the biggest mistake of your life.""The first part of Lion I would give a 9, unfortunately the second part is in the minus numbers, dragging this whole affair into a frustrating thing where you see greatness just out of reach because it appears the studio wanted a shorter movie. That could be wrong about the studio being the cause, but the problem is there anyways. The second part of the movie where we meet up with the big award hype around Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman's parts in the movie is equal parts confusing and overly melodramatic. The melodrama is caused by the audience not being given enough to understand why they are acting the way they do, and the confusion is caused by the same. It jumps all over the place without allowing enough to fill in their stories. How can you follow a story when big chunks of the motivation are were left on the cutting room floor? I imagine there is going to be a directors cut that will flesh out the second part of the movie and make that part watchable, because as it stands it is not. The first part is really well done in every way, but maybe it also could have been a bit longer in certain parts because there was just so much great drama there. So it is hard to understand the acting accolades for Dev Patel when most of his scenes have him acting in ways that left me feeling like I was only hearing one side of a phone conversation because his emotional tone was all over the place, his concerns were all over the place, the drama was all over the place - and we are not given much to know the details on why? That was less so for Nicole Kidman, but her part also left a lot to be desired.""You read a fantastic piece of work,enjoy the research that went into creating every situation. Eventually you look forward to watching the ink take form on screen, your imaginations turned to audio visuals. Then as you sit down to watch the film, with all of your hopes and expectations, suddenly you feel a punch in your gut. Well, not quite literally, but utter disappointment causes that feeling.Even if you consider the movie as an independent entity, besides the novel, there's still no coherency in the plot. The characters have no definition, their development are not defined, the key motive is not clear, and the story just rushes from one scene to next without any precursor. The core concept is so deep and thought-provoking, it deserves a good amount of explanation to the viewer.The pandemonium of characters and scenes diffuses the intensity of the core story. There could have been wonders with Tom Hanks as the lead. The characters of Sienna and Elizabeth Sinskey are all over the place- confusing and misleading. All in all, very disappointing experience with the film! Leaves a feeling that novels should just remain novels and not translated into audio visual. It's not just to the author.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If you have not watched the movie yet, stop reading now before anything gets revealed... SPOILERS AHEAD!
Ever since the first Resident Evil was released, I was willing to keep an open mind about it. And this is coming from someone who is a HUGE fan of the games! I actually enjoyed the first five movies very much so. Different, yes. But still entertaining as can be. Plus, knowing that all of the original heroes were supposed to return for one last stand, was what I was most excited about. Alice fighting along side, Claire and Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy, Jill Valentine, and Ada Wong, it would have been like a dream come true. But all of that changed when I found out none of the actors were asked to return. Instead, we got nothing more than characters who were very quickly disposed and continued to focus on Alice. Figures since, she's the director's wife.
When Retribution concluded, we saw humanity giving a last stand against the undead and BOWs, leaving one of the biggest cliffhangers for this movie to pick up with. And when it starts, the fight is already over with. (a flat out waste in my opinion).
The Story became more confusing once the history of the Red Queen was revealed, as well as Albert Wesker (the main video game villain) being nothing more than just an umbrella employee. Dr. Issacs had his shot in part 3, so why they decided to bring him back (with various clones and such) was beyond me. The Final fight should have concluded with Wesker vs Alice but that's just me.
And in conclusion, though this movie was revealed as ""The Final Chapter"" the ending certainly did not make it seem that way. Wasn't the closure I was hoping for in any way. The only plus side was some of the action in this movie but all in all, I was rather disappointed between the overused jump scares, the rushed/confusing story, but above all, the exclusion of all of our past heroes and having made no mention of them whatsoever.""This movie does not work in any shape or form. I've heard people say that this movie is bad but at least the action is good. If some of your friends say that to you, terminate the friendship, you do not need friends with a bad taste in movies.
Action in this movie sucks, and here is why. There is so much camera shake it gives you headache. Not only is the camera shaking like there's an earthquake going on, there are so many cuts during the action scenes that you can't follow who's where and what is happening. This makes action scenes very painful to watch. I don't even remember what the monsters looked like because of the shaking and all the cuts.
Going further, the horror. So many jumpscares. So close to one another. From the start of the movie to the end, it's just jumpscare after jumpscare. The first two got me, but then it just became annoying. They were very predictable too, because every time there is a jumpscare the music stops. This movie does not deserve to be called horror.
So many idiotic things in the movie, I won't even bother naming them. Only one example. So this group of people is trying to get to the Hive, the guy in the Hive sets the security to maximum. What happens? The people enter the Hive basically on the front door. Maximum security, and the 5 ton steel vault door is open. The door only closes while they are entering to create a stupidly fake tension scene. Goodbye logic. This is just an example, many more things like this in the movie.
Acting is bad, plot holes left and right, and conflicting story lines with the previous movies. I'm starting to wonder if my rating was too generous.""Boyle directs this in his usual teenage-style of fast cuts, cool music, and with little real empathy for his characters. Trainspotting is so overrated, largely because its unique in its own way.
I've watched countless gory horror films, yet the scene where the sh*t hits the... well bowl in this case, was probably the most abhorrent thing I've seen on screen. Was there any need for it? Does anyone want to look at human feces on screen?
Boyle is not a good director, despite the hype. Watch the Beach again, and Trance, the boring Sunshine, and he just comes across as if he's just graduated from film school and has all these cool tricks to try out. No depth I'm afraid""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is a boring pile of horse manure. It starts off as a poorly made gangster film, then side steps into a shoddy tale about racism and eventually becomes a mawkish love story. It finally sticks it hard in your ass with a depressing, wretched and tragic ending.
Ben Affleck is a tiresome misery - he makes a good movie or a high profile movie like Good Will Hunting, or Batman vs Superman:- then he says to himself:- ""Awesome I have got every-bodies attention I must now make a series of tedious, annoying, self-indulgent films to teach everyone a lesson!"" 'Gigli', 'Man About Town', 'Runner Runner', 'Pearl Harbor', 'Phantoms' etc , etc, etc.
If I see one more film where he tries to play the strong silent type but comes off as a sullen faced sanctimonious bore I think I will vomit my damn guts out of my ears. I don't know why but he keeps tricking me into watching his terrible films, films like ""Argo"", what the hell was that all about? Or ""To The Wonder"" which was a baffling hateful snore fest. Or that piece of movie garbage ""Paycheck"".
Please Lord give me the strength to remember how disagreeable of an actor Ben Affleck is and avoid his films like the plague. And Lord help other innocent victims to avoid ""Live By Night"" as if it were gonorrhea! Finally Lord, please find a more suitable actor to fill the role of future batman movies:- maybe Josh Brolin, Or Michael Fassbender or even Russell Crowe, or even Mel Bloody Gibson! or oh yeah Christian Bale!"*** This review may contain spoilers *** OK this is my first review and maybe my last only time will tell.OK I agree with all the other reviews in that this movie was a clichéd movie and slightly bias towards the US. Yes the acting was pretty iffy to say the least maybe except ole Morgan and the plot the usual middle eastern terrorist trying to blow up the west.The movie wasn't that bad for chases and explosions and the aerial shots of London were nice but that's about it really. So that's why I gave it 3 star and god knows what the actors were paid for this but good ole Gerard did run his socks off and kill everyone somehow avoiding getting killed himself. Also what really annoyed me was how in heck can 75% of London's finest bobbies and 65% of the queens own palace guard get infiltrated without getting found out er. Don't bother unless you like car chases or have nothing better to do."Comapire this to Independence day Resurgence, This is by far the worst overall film of 2016, I can't believe such a franchise turning to be so good when they made Divergent become such a bloated segment, I can't hardly imagine a good divergent series sequel, They keep getting worse and worse with each recent installment I cannot take this seriously, On Rotten tomatoes before the movie releases it got 0% so i was wanting to not see it when i saw the rating, But i went anyway, I made a big mistake! I liked some of the actors and the training scene and that's all. I somehow manage to find that scene before it got released to theatres, That was pretty cool. And the rest of the movie was a massive disappointment with a lot of potential on trying to make Jeff Daniels a well acted celebratory, When it rolls over from one step to another nothing in this film collaberates with either the script, direction or both and turned it out to be a complete mess as long as possible, The ending was crap. But the beginning at least made sense,
Let's Move On! I should really stop looking at reviews before watching the film i can tell if a movie is bad or not, I can tell the difference between a good movie and a bad one, With a bad movie the plot holes appear out of nowhere while with a good film the plot follows up to the actual storyline, And also the ending is better with good movies and with bad movies the ending looks trashy.
Now Let's Talk About The Montage, Half of it was Absolutely Unpredictable that the previous film made it's point, This sequel wasn't able to complete what is suppose to be have come, Having the previous film with more excitement than what we have nowadays,
In The End... I'm Sorry but this movie was the biggest Disappointment of 2016, It was Released Somewhere around April in my country, There was nothing else in theatres apart from the Huntsman Winters War, Which I didn't wanna sit through, 10 Cloverfield Lane which the tickets were sold out, The Jungle Book which I'm waiting to see with my group, Zootopia which I've already seen, And The Boss which looks dumb!
I gave It a 3 because i did enjoy some of the film, But wasn't enough to make it a good sequel, It was Completely Unnecessary and was an utter failure.""ALLEGIANT is the third film in the DIVERGENT series, following on from the rubbish INSURGENT. Originally there were meant to be four films in the franchise but this film did so badly at the box office that there's talk of the fourth film being a TV movie which will be interesting to say the least. I really don't like this franchise at all, finding it a mere rip-off of THE HUNGER GAMES which was itself a teen-friendly rip-off of BATTLE ROYALE, but the good news is that ALLEGIANT is much better than the last film in the series, although that doesn't make it good.
INSURGENT was all about predictability and mindless action whereas ALLEGIANT at least has a plot of sorts, even if it isn't a very good one. The same problems that exist with the first two films are also present here, with too much time given over to teen moping around and all of the established adult stars limited to showing up, intoning a few lines of dialogue, and disappearing again. Shailene Woodley makes for an ultra-annoying heroine and hardly someone you can root for. The running time is overlong and too much of the story is padded out with scenes of characters travelling around. The thing that annoys me is the needless way they throw in CGI shot after CGI shot as if that's going to hold the attention; the bit where they float about in those giant bubbles is the nadir of this film. Still, some of the sub-plots are mildly interesting, and at least this film appears to be going somewhere which is better than normal for the franchise.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** M. Night Shyamalan went for a meta approach to his fantasy film. The movie strives to deliver twists from the previous film but it fails on several accounts and ends up being rather dull. Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is the handyman around an apartment complex fixing broken sinks and killing pests. He has a tragic past that he doesn't like to tell the residents about. When a woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) appears in the pool, she tells Cleveland extraordinary things that lead to a fantastical adventure.
Hunting the lady in the water is the Scrunt, a grass-covered wolf. There are lots of rules and mythology brought into the movie but none of it comes to very much and the characters are almost as confused as I was watching it. The movie takes its time to introduce each resident living in the apartment complex including crossword puzzle solver Mr. Dury (Jeffrey Wright), movie critic Harry Farber (Bob Balaban), and the young college student Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) whose mother knows of a fairy tale and serves as an expositional tool.

First and foremost, there's nothing scary about this movie other than a few, very brief moments of terror and intensity.
Second, a couple spending a few days out in the wilderness is not a new movie story line.
Third, all the actors were convincing in their roles. The movie was well made which is why I didn't render it a 1 or -1. Alex (Jeff Roop) is Jenn's (Missy Peregrym) boyfriend and Brad (Eric Balfour), a lone man who gives extended, off the map, deep woods tours.
Fourth, and in the beginning, Jenn has no idea what a colossal idiot her boyfriend Alex is. For example, Alex proceeds to give Jenn a hard time for wanting to bring along defensive bear spray citing she won't need it because he believes there are no bears where their camping.
Fifth, Alex decides to showcase his excellent land navigation skills by not bringing a map, and by getting them hopelessly lost. He felt his memory of past visits to the expansive wilderness their in was more than sufficient.
Sixth, Jenn had a cell phone. Maybe they can use the cell phone's map app to determine their their location. Once again, nuclear engineer Alex took care of that by taking Jenn's cell from her without her knowledge or consent. Way to go Alex!
Seventh, in the mist of all this dismal stupidity, along comes a man eating bear with a taste for human blood. Alex and Jenn are in a tent and see this monster coming. Does Jenn ready the bear spray? No! They sit their in the tent like a couple clowns waiting to be devoured!
Eighth, Alex ends up getting devoured while Jenn sits in the tent and lets it happen while she still possesses the bear spray which she will later leave behind.
Finally, the whole camping trip was orchestrated by Alex, the neurosurgeon who wanted to propose to Jenn. Once the bear enters the scene, the movie becomes extremely painful to watch due to the stupidity of Jenn and Alex. They were such idiots that I started rooting for the bear to end it.""What a terrible remake of such a great classic! I was practically falling asleep the first fifteen minutes! And I don't like the way they changed things! The fact that there's now a real boy and ""real"" animals is unnecessary! I didn't even finish the whole thing and I was disappointed that they ruined such a great original movie! It's upsetting! Cause I watched The Jungle Book from 1967 a lot when I was younger! I wasn't around when the original came out, not until 31 years later. But it's just so upsetting to see such a great movie ruined by unnecessary CGI technology and the plot being switched around! And the fact that the person who voices Kaa isn't even a guy like the original just really aggravates me! So many wrong things about this movie! What a let down! And I don't think I'll finish watching it or watch it again!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Is this the worst movie I've ever seen? No, not really. It's more like a thing that exists, and... that's it. This just exists, fails on every level, and yet... doesn't make me angry.
This is the textbook example of a bland comedy/action film, and stuff like this is the primary reason as to why I detest most comedy films nowadays. And in my humble opinion, being bored is somewhat worse than being angered.
Comedy fails. I don't see where the comedy is. It's like this movie tries to be an action-adventure with elements of comedy thrown in, but it's so non-existent that it doesn't even matter anyways.
Action fails. We're talking about video games attacking famous locations, and even though you DID manage to make the special effects not look like assets purchased from a storefront, you still threw the whole budget to trash by showing, like, two seconds of action per scene.
Story fails. I'm not expecting Shakespeare levels of brilliancy from someone as notorious as Adam Sander, but I expect a better excuse than ""LeL aliens!!!"" if you want me to believe that a bunch of video game characters are attacking Earth.
Characters fail. That's because there is none. You heard me right, there are no characters in this movie. That's it.
The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is that it made a Nintendo property appear in a Sony property with the Donkey Kong scenes, but that's it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It is about time to stop telling kids lies about the tradition of Coca Cola consumerism Christmas/Santa Claus. This is NO lie that needs to be told to children. Take away the gifts and that Coca Cola Red Monstrosity. Do a movie about that, Hollywood... But it would be harder to sell. I have no problems with giving presents to each others on that particular day but you can give a present to anybody at any day. But THIS is not the purpose of Christmastime. This is not the story why people celebrate. Thus making the movie a really really blant animated fantasy flick. It is just wrong. The interpretation of this time of the year needs to be told for what it actually is - daylight/sun. The movie got nothing going for itself. The voice talent of tom hanks is bothersome. This movie is a stinker all over. A big fat lie told to kids and grown ups too. Jaaaayzus.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie started out well. A very attractive woman surfing on a beautiful, secluded beach. There was some great cinematography and shots of the area. Blake Lively even seems to be a decent actress.
Then the shark stuff starts, and from the very beginning, we have to forget about everything we know about sharks and play pretend. First of all, she really ticks off the shark somehow by disturbing its ""feeding grounds."" She approaches a dead whale that the shark was feeding on and seems to have offended the shark somehow. So the shark ignores the thousands of pounds of floating, dead meat in the water for the rest of the movie, and pursues the 100 pound surfer girl exclusively.
The surfer seeks refuge on the carcass of the whale, then the shark drags a dead whale many times its size further out into the ocean, and seems hell bent on knocking her off. In her escape from the floating whale to a small rock outcropping, she's bitten by the shark, and has some serious wounds from both the bite and coral. The shark is circling her, she's bleeding heavily, and there's no one around who can help.
At this point, I'm still willing to forgive the whole shark ignoring the dead whale to pursue a person who isn't even in the water any more. It still felt suspenseful. I wanted her to find a way out and survive. The movie still had my interest and I still cared what happened to her.
Then things got real, real stupid. The shark continued to circle, and killed a drunk on the beach who was trying to reach her. Then it killed two other surfers that she'd met the day before. It tried jumping up on the coral to reach her, and pretty much completely stopped acting like a shark. She managed to escape to a buoy as the tide came in, and the shark proceeded to rip the giant, steel buoy to pieces. She shoots the shark with a flare gun then lights whale oil in the water on fire with it, also lighting the shark on fire. I had already written off the movie at this point, but kept watching as I was already close to the end.
She then ties herself to the anchor that was holding the buoy in place, and as the shark breaks the chains away she is pulled hundreds of feet under water in the matter of a couple of seconds, and the shark chases her at full speed with reckless abandon to kill her. It ends up impaling itself on the jagged spikes which were apparently part of the anchor.
And yea, that was it. A stranded, wounded surfer with nothing kills an over 20 foot long shark by making it chase her into spikes. Dumb.
You know what would have been good? A wounded surfer on a small rock outcropping tries to keep her sanity and get help to survive a shark attack. Leave out the dead whale because that kind of made the rest of the movie not make sense. Don't make a wounded, half dead surfer kill a 20+ foot shark, that's not the victory that the movie needed. It would have been sufficient to have her survive. You don't have to schlock it up with the typical Hollywood type ending.
Sharks are scary enough, you don't have to make it cartoonish shark with a vendetta against a surfer. Every time the shark did something stupid that a shark would never do, it became less suspenseful. I don't know why they went down that road, but they turned a movie that started out pretty suspenseful into a SciFi Channel made for TV special with a dumb ending.""Based on real events, this film was a disaster! I'm writing this review while the film is still rolling... well it took me 4 days (everyday watching a bit of it) to get to the last half an hour of this film and I cannot bear watching one more second. If I was watching it in a movie theater I'd surely walk away.
In the true story, a force of around 300 men chased a huge number of European art treasures to save them from the Nazis and rescue the heritage of the Western civilization. I guess that the number of men was enormously reduced in this film so that the viewer could relate and connect to the characters.. well probably I couldn't care less even if a bomb demolished them all. Some of the real events were altered to serve the dramatic portrayal and every time the film tried to look serious the scenes only seemed hilarious.
The WAR COMEDY film was not funny and the war action scenes were so badly executed that they seemed like rehearsals.. For a moment there I thought that the main characters did not care about what they were doing.. as if some of them were forced to do it.. and this goes even for Cate Blanchett! I don't know how the movie managed to make her look so bad.
I did not really expect something so serious, but at least a light movie that makes you laugh.. something like ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"". Yet, this movie failed at every level. I only gave it 3/10 because it is based on a true story that was historically quite important. Or else I consider it only slightly better than ""Battle of Los Angeles (2011)"".""I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called ""family"", against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.
I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the ""characters"" of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.
Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).
Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. Chiché story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.
A waste of time, at least for me.""I'm a huge Scorsese fan, so I was excited to see this film. I knew going in that this was not the normal Scorsese work, so I was also curious and even a bit anxious to see him step outside of his typical genre. For the first hour or so, I was fascinated. For the next half hour, I became a bit bored, but still hoped for a satisfying payoff. When it finally came, I was massively disappointed. Maybe I missed something. But I'm pretty sure I didn't. I realize I'm in the minority of people who seriously dislike this movie, but I just don't understand what's so great about it. I gave it 4 stars due to gorgeous sets and cinematography, and pretty damn good acting. Too bad these potentially interesting characters had an immensely uninteresting story to work with. If you're not familiar with the plot, it centers around a boy who lives in and around a train station, set in days past, who dodges various surly types (Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen), while trying to unlock a mystery involving an automaton left behind by his deceased father. Sounds promising right? That's what I thought. I was wrong.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie starts by trying to make you feel uncomfortable by using lots of long close up shots and grating sounds. I'm fine with this device for building some tension and discomfort but after a while you see it doesn't really lead anywhere.
What could have been an interesting story is ruined because the director decided to jump between timelines for no other reason than they can. I think it's supposed to be 'arty' but it's really just jarring and frustrating. Very few scenes have any meaningful dialogue. Because of this there's no real character development or engagement. Sure it's easy enough to fill in the blanks but I just feel it was lazy writing.
All in all the most intriguing part of the story is glossed over and misses its own point because of bad scene order, low quality writing and a soundtrack that just sounds like someone pressed shuffle on their phone. They should have pressed skip instead, and so should you.""It absolutely baffles me that so many people have rated this movie a 10/10. After watching both Red Dragon and Manhunter, I've never been so disappointed. The acting in this movie was sub par at best; it was impossible to watch at times. The characters were not well constructed at all and there honestly wasn't one character that truly felt like they fit this movie. Watch Red Dragon if you haven't already and you will never watch this movie again. There were no thrills to this movie, the final scene was one of the worst climaxes I've ever seen, though there wasn't really much build up to it so you could only be so disappointed. This movie does for Red Dragon what The Godfather part 3 does for the original godfather. Save your time and your money, do not watch this movie!""Total Recall, the original, was the cutting edge of science-fiction when it first came out, and it had an original plot and good performances. It was pure entertainment. The movie is already a classic, right? This being the case, I wonder why movie studios feel the need to spend millions of dollars remaking a movie that was good, into a movie that is not good. Granted, the special effects and visual style are great in this modern version, but the movie doesn't have the thrill, feeling and entertainment factor that the original.
Besides, the performances are mediocre. Farrell, a great actor, is wasted in this movie. Biel plays her usual tight-pants bimbo character, which doesn't make her any favor as an actress nor give her credibility as such. Beckinsale shines at times as villain, but not much because she is not the person for this role, which needs of a mix of house-wife bimbo dangerous gal both in looks and performance to create the ambiguity that her role needs to be believable.
I found myself bored while watching this movie, despite some scenes being visually stunning, all the visual production very sleek, and quite cool.
Despite some glimpses of goodness, this movie is not good. In cases like this I think studios should think about donating so many wasted millions to charity institutions. That would be good.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The most heroic aspect of this movie is the heroic effort it took to sit through the whole thing.
Kick Ass was half a good movie. It started strong, then petered out at the half way point. But even the bad second half of that movie was better than any part of this sequel.
The movie tries hard to be funny, but it isn't funny.
A promise to a father's friend takes precedence over a promise to a father. What? Hit Girl breaks the promise to her father, to keep fighting crime, to make a promise to generic cop father's friend guy. At least she goes back to keeping the promise to Big Daddy.
The movie set up a conflict between mf'er and his uncle, but it never paid off on that conflict.
The movie set something up with Kick Ass' upgraded costume, but never paid off on that. Kick Ass can barely hold his own in a fight with Chris, MF'er, shown to be a complete wimp throughout the movie.
I used super speed for this one - often fast forwarding through parts of it so I could get to the end faster.
I thought the end fight was going to be good. But it wasn't.""How in the hell this got a rating above 7 on IMDb is beyond me and I'll never trust this site again. There is nothing redeeming about this piece of crap movie. Tried to be funny and cute and it's not. What little plot is ridiculous and dumb, gratuitous nudity, swearing etc.... Russel Crowe is fat and bloated and Gosling is a tiny bit better but nothing can save this waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip this joke. An obvious rip off / knock off of Lethal Wespon films and can't even come close. Buddy films can be fun but this one isn't. Disappointing to sit down with friends and after taking all kinds of time we select this movie. Kept hoping it would get better but never did. People walking out of the room early. Awful. An example of why Hollywood just makes garbage (mostly) now. Total Garbage""Between the soldier's light quilted armor sewn perfectly with a machine, the symmetrical cross gable roof on the Church built with dimensional lumber not introduced until the 1800's, the phony modern Scot's accent (in the 11th century who knows how they spoke. Not English certainly.) the ""fingernails on the chalkboard"" music mixed far too loudly and the the whispering voices mixed far too quietly, the net result was that the movie was just simply a mess. Pretty cinematography. Good acting (probably should have acted with a made-up language and subtitles. Pig Latin maybe. Moe: Omay. Larry: Arrylay. Curley: Curleycue, Nyuk Nyuk). Silent would have been the best. We quit about halfway through in in total frustration. Not recommended.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Most times, I can understand why others enjoy a film that I don't but this is one occasion that truly baffles me. So I question: did the initial hype influence enough people to believe the Hurt Locker was a great film before they saw it? Surely the sheer number of folk who enjoyed this film puts paid to that theory - we can't all be that gullible, can we?
Baffled, I recently decided to re-watch it and I have to say, unlike a fine wine, it hadn't improved with age. The first half hour is scene setting. The subject matter and ""characters"" and introduced. At this point, the film shows promise but sadly, it just doesn't develop from there.
Second time around, I still couldn't detect any plot. Characterization was shallow. In the absence of these elements, there's nothing to draw this viewer in or propel the film forward so all we get is a series of isolated, generally uninvolving scenes - though admittedly, a couple of them are quite powerful.
When the film ended, I felt I hadn't actually watched a film at all, so lacking was it in vital ingredients. But then it wasn't a documentary either (not enough explanation, characterisation or factual content). Whatever Hurt Locker is, it just doesn't entertain me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Trying to be kind to this Film is difficult. Like so many recent 'Horror' Films this just falls flat on almost every level and like so many, frustratingly so. We've all - certainly in more recent years- heard of this Forest and have no doubt heard of the numerous cases of people going here to sadly end their lives. So to then make a Film specifically and unapologetically set in and around this location should have led to one hell of an offering, filled with drama, suspense and genuine psychologically based 'Horror'.
Instead what we have here is void of all these components. We also have a poorly cast leading Actress who couldn't carry her shopping never mind a Film, poor dialogue between characters and to be honest what seemed to be a mish mash of conflicting ideas as to what direction the plot should take. There was little cohesion in this Film sadly. We had the usual trope of people doing stupid things, saying stupid things and generally just acting stupid. There was no drama, no suspense and nothing of any psychological depth. There were plenty of attempted jump scares though sadly even for them you knew exactly where and when they were coming and so even the vain hope that they could somehow save this was sadly lost.
Overall a sadly pathetic attempt at Film making.""While watching Home Alone it became so plainly obvious (to me) to see just why Macaulay Culkin would never, ever survive his transition from being a child star into anything that even resembled that of a successful actor as an adult. Never. And, it's true. He wouldn't. 'Cause, believe me, he didn't.
The writing was so clearly written on the wall for Culkin. And it was quite plainly evident even here in Home Alone. I mean, just like child star Shirley Temple, all of Macaulay's appeal and charm rested solely on the pre-packaged concept of her/him being perceived as that little tyke who was just the sweetest of all the ""cutie-pies"" imaginable.
Like, let's face it, it takes real talent (as well as a certain amount of cuteness, of course) to make it as an adult actor. It does. And talent is something that Culkin seemed to possess so very-very little of (and it showed) once he had grown out of that darling, little ""baby"" phase of his.
So, unless you're a child, yourself, or an adult who's easily amused by implausible nonsense, then Home Alone's story is just gonna leave you mighty high and dry - 'Cause, hey, other than being completely childish, there sure ain't much joy, merriment, or laughter going on in this one. No way.""One of the worst movies in this genre. The child star was supposed to be cute but she was grating and wooden, she was at times really annoying to watch and it was hard for me to watch the movie. This is the only Spielberg movie where i walked out of the theater than endure more than 30mins of the movie.
The movie just starts all of a sudden with a very pompous girl who has insomnia but looks perfect. Her acting was was a pain to watch and i am surprised that she made the cut ahead of so many other kids who would have made the movie a treat to watch. For some reason the graphics and CGI were too bright to enjoy and the camera movement sometimes gave me a whiplash.""""Midnight Special"" offers an intriguing premise and an impressive cast, but aside from the sporadic dazzle of otherworldly beams of light, there is little else that shines here.
The film possesses a somber tone, not unlike the far superior Nichol's film ""Take Shelter,"" and within this atmosphere Michael Shannon  playing the supernatural boy's father, Roy  is free to do what he does best: stare into the middle distance broodingly. Unfortunately, the script does not provide sufficient emotional depth for Shannon to draw upon. He's a desperate father who will stop at nothing to protect his ""special"" son. That's really all it boils down to.
The typical security and intelligence types of the US government comprise the film's primary antagonists. We're also exposed to a forgettable duo hailing from a religious cult whom regard the young boy as some kind of conduit to a higher power, and so these two under-qualified beige men are burdened with divine purpose: apprehend the venerated youngster.
Thankfully, the government types and cult members aren't their typical obnoxious selves, as they're oft-presented in film; nonetheless, they are decidedly vapid and nonthreatening. You won't find here a menacing pursuer such as the likes of Anton Chigurh from ""No Country for Old Men.""
The gradual revelation of the powerful, yet fragile young boy's supernatural powers may prove enough to keep a science fiction fan's interest piqued throughout the film  considering his feats are equal parts remarkable and ambiguous. Regrettably, the film's climax is rather underwhelming and trite. We're provided with something tangible to marvel at, but much is left unexplained and to the imagination. When room is left to interpret and speculate about a film's ending I'm usually thankful, but here I'm just left feeling short-changed and disappointed by uninspired writing.
There may be something to be said about themes relating to parenting, sacrifice, loss, and faith, but the film just wasn't engaging or rewarding enough to warrant my probing it for meaning""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Everyone and the audience in Basic Instinct has seen a noir, or a Hitchcock. That is, except for our lead detective protagonist, who walks right into danger's arms and willingly embraces it. The first half and hour or so of the film is full of furious winking at the viewer. We have to play along with what seems like parody. Stone's reveal is with a knowing smirk on her face, as if she knows what everyone knows, that she will curl him around her fingers and get him to do whatever she wants. She might as well have a big, blinking sign floating above her head reading 'FEMME FATALE'. There is a bespectacled therapist ripped straight out of The Big Sleep, and who isn't fooling anyone; she immediately takes the glasses off, and is revealed to be another sexy conquest of Nick's after they air their dirty laundry out in the open. Catherine's massive inherited mansion seems to be eternally lit with shadowy rays of light bouncing off the pool - a perfect noir storm. She opens the door in revealing clothing and then proceeds to flaunt her naked body anyway in full sight of the detectives. No wait, that's not obvious enough. Later on she tells Nick a couple of key facts: one, she's not wearing any underwear, two, he'll pick up the drink and cigarette again, three, she's very good at lying, and four, she's going to kill him. Nick's partner, a bumbling, heavyset oaf, is oblivious to the searing sexual tension in the car. They're basically having sex from the first time they lay eyes on each other, and the dialogue is the foreplay. It's a wonder the actors can wrest with lines this heavy with a straight face. Every word is twisted, double edged, laced with the suggestion of ""we're gonna bang"". 'Sex' is actually only used seven times in the whole script, but with Verhoeven's penchant to linger on their sultry stares for a second or five too long, it seems like hundreds.
Yet one could never accuse Verhoeven films of being straightforward - look to those who missed the point of Starship Troopers. This one's a little tricky. If you know Verhoeven you have to give him some benefit of the doubt. The first half of the film plays like a B-movie noir parody - not just once, but twice, Stone has an excuse to get out the ice pick and get stabby stabby. Haven't these people ever heard of an ice tray? The movie world is where a degree in psychology means you can pull a man's mind apart with ease - she knows Nick's whole history, his vices, his temptations. Beth, the actual shrink, sort of flails around helplessly. So Verhoeven shows that he knows the genre inside out, and that he's self aware. But the second half takes itself far too seriously. Having shown all its cards, it doesn't know how to conclude, so it just shoves the pair back under the covers. And after two hours of suggesting that there is more than meets the eye to this girl, it goes back on its word. Oh, she was serious when she announced out loud that she was going to kill him? I thought she was supposed to be the smart one.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I don't care if some people think that this movie is great. I don't care if its gotten 98% on rotten tomatoes, or if it won best animated film, or if people for the most part loved. I wouldn't show this film to my kid and think it's terrible. What kills me is that Inside Out has a pretty creative atmosphere. The animation is really nice and colorful, and the idea of someone trying to cope with a new environment is an idea worth discussing in a kids film. But the comedy is really awful. There are many awkward and unamusing moments, and not for the right reasons. Also, I don't really like the choices of actors to voice the characters. I mean, Amy Poehler as Joy? Why couldn't you get someone like Ellen Degeneres again? I'd probably be able to tolerate her more. And that leads me to my biggest problem. The characters are pretty unlikable. Joy does nothing but act egotistical and is constantly mean to sadness, so when there's a sad moment, I have no sympathy for her. Sadness is really obnoxious, if not more than Joy. All she does is complain and act like a pill. But it's okay because she's the one who'll make things better in the end, right? No. She's a tool for Joy to learn her lesson, and it does't work because I don't like either one. And look, I know that moving to a new town is difficult, but I feel like Reily is a little too mean in her new situation. She shuts out everyone around her, doesn't act all that nice, so I don't really root for her. Why didn't she just tell her parents at the end that she was upset and express her feelings? Why did she have to act unkind to everyone? Some people claim to have cried during this film, but I didn't cry once because none of the characters were likable. This is worth skipping. I don't know a lot of people who like this film, and I don't think it's a very good influence on kids. I hope it's forgotten.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** After about half an hour, i was so annoyed with the whole space ship crew that i hoped the aliens would just kill them off and get it over with quickly. The decisions they make are so dumb that it seems completely incomprehensible that anyone would ever trust them to fly an expensive space ship all by themselves. Usually in survival type films there is at least one character that you should develop some sort of sympathy with, but there just isn't such character in Prometheus. The thrill and suspense scenes become kind of awkward when you hope for the wrong guys to win. I do give it three stars because i didn't fall asleep or got annoyed enough to turn it off. For some odd reason, i thought even AVP was better than this.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Seriously??? I was looking forward to watching this because it was so highly rated. I hate gore horror but love spooks! Nothing like a movie that builds up tension and suspense. This was like a t.v. episode of A Haunting in ""some city."" It had spooky start. It seemed like it would go well but then it is a cheesy Amitiville Horror rip off. I am obviously in the minority here.
Potential plot SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS
This turns into a cheesy Catholic vs demon story. They could not even come up with something even slightly unique. Very choppy. Characters not interesting. Then the final straw- the person who must be exorcised. Ugh! So overdone. This was so boring.
I don't know how anyone who is a fan of the genre could possibly be excited by this. I found a movie like, It Follows, so much creepier.""I should have known better when I saw the Adam Sandler credit; after all, he's made a career out of terrible movies. However, once I started I had to continue out of curiosity, just to see how abysmally awful it was going to be. There's plenty of noise, guns, violence, anal insertions, and more nipples than you'll ever want to see, held together by a plot that may have worked under better hands. Sandler plays a jerk (what else is new?) and Spade his patsy. I found it hard to care what happened to either one of them!
Do yourself a favor and find something that requires a few more IQ points!""I'm tired of watching the same plot over and over on this kind of movies, I just don't understand why can't we have good sci-fi movies anymore.
Acting is mostly OK, but the characters are so void and stereotyped. Technically is also well done, but we all have seen these scenarios many times before. Everything is highly predictable. It is frustrating to acknowledge they missed a good opportunity to make a decent sci-fi movie with such good resources at hand.
This for sure could have been a good movie, it only lacks imagination and avoidance of beaten-to-death clichés.""This was maybe the worst movie I saw in about 10 years. I would be embarrassed to act in this movie and the directing was just awful. Even the acting or the camera work wasn't good. Everything was just bad. And then it is incredibly preachy: If you are a non-believer you are 'doomed'? Come on! Word of advice for atheists or agnostics who are tempted to watch this movie: don't do it! Word of advice for religious people: ask yourself if it is really necessary to show that non-believers are less worthy or in the wrong and have to be convinced to find faith. Try not to be biased watching this and ask yourself why do you have to be indoctrinated by movies like this to think atheists are worth less.
Stupid dreadful movie. I can't even find words for it.""It has so much potential. Great cast, great sets, great premise. It is hard to know what went wrong. Lets start with the plot. Pretty weak. There were so many opportunities for action, drama or humour and there was just nothing. So it scores nothing Dialogue: I do hope that this was not ad-libbed. Because then I would have to say that the actors got it seriously wrong. Let's just assume it was a the corny dialogue that made most of the stars look like they were phoning it in using autocue. There was one scene with a minster, a bishop a rabbi and an orthodox priest. again a target rich environment for humour.. and it was just flat.If there was any clever word-play I missed it And that sums up the whole film. Great possibilities, under-par delivery. Disappointing""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Pixels was a movie I was optimistic about seeing. Then I saw it. The first of a few problems is the actors. Adam sandler is a good actor in this, but his character is bad, the female and the nerd dude are forgettable, Kevin James and Peter dinklage are awful (Acting and characters), and the rest of the cast is irrelevant. The plot loses cohesion as the movie progresses, and it is not explained how dinklage cheated on both the arcades and in the pac-man battle, and the aliens somehow know eddie cheated. The last and most glaring problem is major anachronisms throughout the film. As well as Madonna, Samantha Fox, Daryll Hills, John Oates, and Max Headroom all being relevant AFTER 1982, when the capsule was stated to have been launched, many games are also improperly shown. Arkanoid (Taj Mahal, it's not Breakout, as that was only on the Atari 2600 and 5200), The duck hunt dog, Paperboy, and tetris were all after 1982 (Duck hunt was released first in the 1970's, but the dog did not appear until 1984 on the NES). The only positive is the pixel effect. Though technically voxels, it still looks very nice. To Quote: Rotten Tomatoes ""Pixels has little replay value and is hardly worth a quarter.""""*** This review may contain spoilers *** So this review has spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, the only continue reading if you don't care for spoilers.
So the start of this movie, up till 95% was absolutely awesome. I was hoping for the sweet revenge of DiCaprio totally taking down this institution.
However he last 5% of the movie shows that he was dreaming/imagining up ALL of it. All the 95% was his frickin imagination!!!! Oh my gosh at that point I felt like I had wasted HOURS of my life. The first 95% of the movie likse 2+ hours. I know movies aren't real, but now the STORY WASN'T REAL. I watched the movie for the story, just to find out in the ending that everything up to that point was not real story, just imagination of the patient. What on earth?!? If the ending was where DiCaprio got revenge on the institution, then this would be mind blowing 10 on 10 review for me!""With all those big name stars, and a topic I like to know about I was looking forward to seeing it all. Not for long though, but I persevered for about 20 minutes, and then saw the last few minutes, and the extra piece on the DVD. Is that enough to be able to comment?
Well, it's longer than I've given some other really big earners! Unless I can see what is happening from very early on, they have a problem in keeping me there. They failed. So, why rate it as HIGH as 2? Coz the special effects are impressive.
Michael Caine looks better than in some other movies. Perhaps age is making him more mellow, and less brash.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I do not like musicals, but there was so much talk about this film, that I saw it and I must say that I repent deeply. It's one of the worst movies I've seen lately. The stereotype of the musician who lives almost defeated and scratching the poverty is a sin in which the director had not fallen in the masterpiece Whiplash. Besides, it shows the woman as a completely unstable and shameless human being, who without showing us a background of his relationship with Greg, falls into the infidelity easier a fly in a dump. And to finish off, she lives so unhappily, that years after being married, she can do nothing more than imagine what her life would be like with her old adventure. Pathetic. It shows some more forms of human misery than the possibility of seeing something pleasant, something endearing, that makes you see it again.
Some mentions about jazz that do not transcend at all. Actually, I will forget this movie.""The premise seemed cute. Who hasn't, as a pet owner or animal lover, thought about what sort of shenanigans your pets might get up to while you're away? The reality of the movie, however, was not at all cute. While some of the bits are cute, and certain characters were endearing, on the whole, this movie is repulsive, especially as something that is intended for and marketed to children. Most of the action is very violent, with little in the story line beyond this violence or the threat of violence; importantly, it is much more gruesome than one would expect from cartoon violence and nearly constant. Additionally, it is very, very crude. It is absolutely not something that I would want my children to see and I myself did not find it enjoyable, partially because it was not particularly funny, well-made, or endearing, and partially because I was concerned about all of the kids in the theater seeing and hearing what I was; I'm sure some of it went over their heads, but certainly not all of it. It saddens me that children's entertainment stooped so low.""This film was so badly written and directed that I seriously can't believe someone backed this financially nor that Netflix made this one of their original films. In short... it sucks in every way imaginable and isn't the least bit entertaining! The story line makes no sense whatsoever and is a bad investment of your time to even watch. THIS FILM WAS ANYTHING BUT FUNNY not possessing a funny line anywhere in its cliché and pathetic script, or ridiculous antics. Boring would be a compliment to describing this sorry piece of work. Its just so bad it seems to be career assassination for Josh Peck (actor from Drake and Josh) who was one of the two stars in this film, and yet isn't even listed as a star in the credits (not that it helps him in any way). It was such a bad film that I made it a must do task to get online and write this review to warn the next person, which is something I never do.
Save yourself the time and money, and simply find yourself something else to watch. Eventually you'll thank me for it later.""I bought the Oscar hype. Don't do it. It's not worth your time. I don't get all the hype behind this movie.
It was just... completely... slow... and... boring... and... depressing... and... slow...
The acting was decent. But the parts and writing was not not Oscar-good. The writing and directing was just awful. There was no real story. No likable characters. It could've been at least 30 minutes shorter and it still would have been slow. This completely reminded me of Boyhood -- All hype, very long, with nothing to see and totally forgettable. Every day life is boring. That's why you go to the movies -- To see something different. This was like a reality show of your jerk of a neighbor after his family dies. It's depressing, boring and bland. Normal people doing normal things is not interesting.
Afleck and the kid have acting chops, but the parts were just not anything to get behind. There was hardly anything to really like about either of them. The parts certainly didn't warrant Oscar attention. Michelle Williams is barely in the movie. I don't even know how she qualified for Oscar contention. She appears 3 times for just a few minutes each.
It's one of those films I had to see to understand the attention, but will forget all about it in just a few days. I wish I had skipped this and watched one of the other nominees instead.""Easy on the eye but not worthy of the hype and the Oscar nomination. An interesting story has been directed in a very heavy handed way, which to me was constantly irritating. Almost every scene is overstated to the point that, as others have said, there is a propaganda feel to the film. Did the director really need to portray every white person, bar two, as vigorously racist or anti-women, even though virtually all the characters are clearly intelligent and from well educated backgrounds? This is a film where the message would have been stronger and more credible if a degree of balance and subtlety had been added to the mix. The things I enjoyed: some strong performances by a very capable cast, a very authentic period setting, a story which is totally engaging. The thing which turned me off: the exaggeration.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I absolutely loved the 1st Alice, which was directed by Tim Burton himself. It brought a feeling of awe and madness and that was very much lacking in this sequel. Well, calling it a sequel isn't correct because it has absolutely no connection to the 1st one. The characters are there but the story has no motivation. The only thing that really made me happy was listening to Alan Rickman's voice, one more time.
STORY - Alice has been gone from the Underland as well as from the real land for a long, long time. Things have changed. In the real world, Alice's ex-fiancé has taken over her business and when she comes to know that she is about to lose her medium for adventure, Underland calls her for help. Hatter is distraught and is dying out of grief and Alice must help him. In order to help him, Alice goes to Time himself in order to fix the past and thus mend the present. This could have been an interesting story but the screenplay starts to fall apart after 45 minutes of screen-time. There is no real character motivation and everything seems to fall in the correct place with no real explanation. Like how did Iracebeth meet Time? How did she even return because as far as I remember, she was sent to exile. It was so convenient when Alice falls into the wrong timeline and finds out about the exact things she has to fix. I know it's a kid's story but there was no fun in it. Everyone was so weepy and emotional and that brings me to the director.
DIRECTION - So, this one is not directed by Tim Burton. It is directed by James Bobin who has directed the Muppet movies and Ali G. Now that explains a lot. I just don't understand that why doesn't a director return for the sequel? I mean, you started it. Just see it through! James Bobin just sucked out the fun. I know the original was cheesy and over-the-top but it was fun. A bit exposition heavy but it added to the character of the Underland. This movie just expected us to assume where something is taking place. Last night I was watching a video about the flaws in BvS and there the Youtuber mentioned that BvS didn't have a sense of place. Gotham and Metropolis look the same. The characters are kept in close-up so you don't feel the place they are in and that detaches the audience from feeling anything real. The case here is almost similar. The 1st movie always introduced the place where the characters were entering, due to which I'd know that where the characters are. Here it was just jump, jump and jump. I don't want to include a separate section for CGI and editing so I am including it here. The editing wasn't snappy enough. If you'd remember the tea- party scene in the 1st movie, you'd notice that it was very quick and that made that scene more humorous. Here, they missed a lot of beats and it wasn't only limited to the tea-party scene but the whole movie. The CGI felt extremely off at times. The lighting was wrong in the opening scene as well as when Alice meets Hatter for the 2nd time.
ACTING - The acting was very bland. They were doing the same thing that they did in the original. Johnny Depp felt a bit off but I won't blame him. The worst of the lot was Sacha Baron Cohen, who was actually doing a Borat impression the whole time. Again, won't blame him.
FINAL VERDICT - I hate it when sequels just bank on the success of the 1st one and doesn't improve on it. What is the rush? Make a proper script, take your time and give us a good movie. If you've haven't seen this one, don't. Just re-watch the original. This one is certainly not worth your TIME.""For a film that's predicated on being dumb fun, ""XXX: The Return of Xander Cage"" seems rather uninterested in having too much of it. Often rote and plodding for a would-be thrill ride, the film feels more like a checklist being fulfilled than a genuinely creative endeavor. It's a business gambit, like most wide releases these days, but unusually bare-faced about it.
Much of that lies on the broad shoulders of star Vin Diesel, who reprises a role that's about a decade past its sell-by date. Pushing fifty (believe it or not), he's clearly having a ball and wondering why he didn't do this earlier. But looking convincing as a daredevil spy with attitude is an increasingly difficult act to pull off. The producers seem to have anticipated this, as they have assembled a hefty supporting cast to help get Vin over the line.
Chief among these (and the film's most welcome presence) is venerable Hong Kong star Donnie Yen, who touches off a panic when he and his exceedingly extreme crew (Bollywood's Deepika Padukone, fellow martial artist Tony Jaa and UFC fighter Michael Bisping) snatch a satellite-controlling device from the inadequately vigilant CIA. Shaken, the spooks turn to a man after Yen's own heart - the exiled Diesel.
Fortunately, years away have not dampened Diesel's skill at unorthodox spycraft. After taking some time to track down his garish fur coat (eliciting audible snickers from viewers at my screening), Diesel assembles a crew of his own, consisting of currently ubiquitous dynamo Ruby Rose, former K-Popper Kris Wu and Rory McCann of ""Game of Thrones"" fame. It's a fatal mistake, as the sidekicks fail to thrill and serve only to provide forgettable quips and bog down the plot. It's hard not to think Diesel (and the entire film) would be better off without.
Speaking of plot, anyone here for one is barking up the wrong tree; the action sequences are the main focus here. These are handled competently enough - Diesel's intro on skis then skateboard and a frenzied foot chase through a busy motorway serve as highlights. Alternately, it's easy to see where director D.J. Caruso could have taken more care. A motorcycle chase running from jungle to beach is suddenly gummed up by commandos stationed on a sandbar providing wildly inaccurate gunfire. How did they know to be there? Your guess is as good as mine. The shooting and missing carries on later during a pitched battle in a warehouse; if there's an award for that, those henchmen have surely earned it.
All in all, it's a mainly joyless, overloaded exercise in style. Yen and Padukone do provide as much charisma as the paltry script allows and serve as passable foils for Diesel, who comes strictly as he is. That's by no means a bad thing, but it's not to enough to elevate this paint-by-numbers enterprise. Perhaps tone is the biggest problem. The film simply doesn't capitalize on its inherent silliness. When you veer as close to spoof territory as this gets, it's best to just go all-out, which doesn't happen here.
Unwieldy and uninspiring, 3/10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** How batman and superman was rubbish this movie is completely identical. Superhero against superhero. Please give up this kind of scenario anymore. The name of the movie Captain America?? But looks like avengers. Action action action, without aim...I have spent my time for nothing. Unfortunately following movie will be come. Spiderman appeared at the end of the movie, in the next movie we are waiting for Batman and more. Superhero party is underway. First movies about mixing superheroes in one movies like avengers was OK. But if the main hero is captain America so be it. If there are so many hero, the movie name should be avengers, x men...How somebody can rate this movie over 5 without any bias. Strange!!!""I can't say I was disappointed because I should have guessed that a religious film would be like this, but I had hoped it would have some good points. It was tedious, overlong, repetitive, and, at times ridiculous (God's voice?). The landscape was nice, I guess, and the acting wasn't bad. I felt sorry for the actors having to work with a clunky script like that. It left me completely cold. I was not interested in any of the characters or what became of them. The dialogues were excruciatingly unnatural and painfully slow. I didn't go to see Scorsese's other two ""religious"" films and I wish I hadn't gone to see this one. I only went because I live in Portugal and it was about two Portuguese priests. Dumb reason, huh?""Ron Howard & Co must have worked very, very, hard to turn all these wonderful elements into boring rubbish.
The locations ...as with past Robert Langdon movies...were excellent. The revised plot was sooo unlikely
And....why could none of the security folks jump into the water to help...how unlikely
A first-rate performance by Irrfan Khan which deserves notice...as wonderfully balanced between professionally proud of mayhem, and sorry to have inconvenienced the ""right"" side. Sly and scene-stealing.
And...with all these terrible reviews ... how in the world does the score rise to a semi-good 6.2??
Ron... you should post a heart-felt apology to all of us....""Minimum of ten lines. That will be difficult. How do you lambaste a movie that was just so terrible that it makes you wonder why anyone would waste their money producing it. It also makes me wonder how and why James Franco is still involved in acting. He is without question, one of the worst actors of all time. And, don't get me started about Brian Cranston. It would have been nice if he had played it like the father in Malcolm in the Middle but he played it more like Mr. White from Breaking Bad. It was horrible. In fact, if you watch Drive and see Cranston in that - this role was almost identical to that one. And, although he can act, his character was just not fun nor funny. He played a straight man to what should have been the comedy of Franco but Franco didn't have funny lines so there was no need for a straight man. Shame on the studios for tricking me into seeing this tripe. It was terrible. Without question, do not see this film.""This movie is garbage. Another review said something about how this will probably play well with the Stoner crowd. Just wanted to say: heck no, this certainly doesn't represent me or any stoner I know. Hollywood is such a shame these days. Tons of good actors and actresses, great work on visuals and scenery, but apparently not a single producer left wants to hire anything but the oldest tired hacks, or total space cases. Awful and out of touch. How do they spend so much producing these movies without bothering to hire decent story writers? Who watches these things? I don't get it. This is right up there with every other tired movie out there right now in terms of horrible.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Rakesh Roshan and Sanjay Gupta's joined hands to make a movie called ""Kaabil"" with our favourite superhero ""Hrithik Roshan"". Well to start off with 1st half of movie was really nice as i was hooked on to understand how bad the scenario went for blind couple (Hrithik & Yami gautam) and how the law is not supporting them or even considering their case as local corporator ""Ronit Roy & Rohit Roy"" are running the game.
But 2nd half of movie becomes too artificial to even follow. When the revenge drama starts and the way Rohit (Hrithik) takes revenge from the Roy brothers.... man they missed out big time on that. There are some huge disconnction of characters. As one particular scene shows after Supriya (Yami) gets raped and both Rohit and Supriya are thrashed by this incident a day later Rohit goes to work as he is an dubbing artist. I was so surprised so see that scene how in the world can anyone do that And when Rohit goes for work Supriya gets raped again.... I was like this is so freaking bizarre man.
Also one particular scene shows after the 1st rape incident Rohit and Supriya are kept captive in a safe house for 24hours out of city... but during the climax Rohit tells Madhavrao Shellar (Ronit Roy) to meet him at safe house ... How the hell does a blind person can know about that place...
Overall its okay-ish movie but kinda depression one. Watch at your own risk.""Spoilers.
Star Wars Episode VII is by far the worst installment of the beloved franchise. Not a single character or plot device is either believable or understandable. To start off, let's start from the beginning. Every step this film takes feels forced and made to happen to propel the film through is recycled and unimaginative script of A New Hope Episode VI with none of the magic or ""star wars feel."" For instance, Boyega's character ""Finn"" as he's named immediately to establish itself interacts with the rebel pilot in an unconvincing scene where they chum up in a matter of seconds and the whole thing is awkward, unrealistic and purely thrown together to establish who the hell Boyega is. Finn's journey into treason is absolute without background or cause and is just purely there for an obvious reason. That is the essence of this movie in that every sequence and characters motives or decisions are lacking in substance, believable, or reason. Next, all the original stars of the movie start pouring in to do sad cameos and weak parodies of their younger selves that feel like an old eighties rock band reuniting for a final tribute that leaves the fans feeling awkward and depressed. Soon they reach their destination and in a matter of seconds they are all happy friends allied together for obvious reasons and Han offers her a job and Chewie thinks she is cool and gives her a gun and wow we have gone from zero to one billion with zero character development. So, they walk into another throwback scene where Han shoots Greedo only this time they are seeking advice from Maz Kanata on getting BB-8 to the Resistance as they are called now and have a terribly unrealistic argument where Finn wants to run away wherein Ray follows shortly after getting freaked out by a light-saber that has no reason to be in such a place in the first place. Finn is still trapped in a lie that he is with the resistance something he was trying desperately to hold onto to maintain his relationship with Ray, what? Now, on top of all this, why are Ray, Finn, or anybody for that matter so familiar with the events of Luke, Darth Vader, Leia, and Han Solo? There should be some residual knowledge that a Jedi and Sith orders both existed, and they used a fabled magic (the force) and a feared weapon of diligence (the light-saber). Continuing from that is the total insanity of a yuppie ex-storm trooper wielding a light-saber! That is the most prestigious and difficult weapon to wield in the galaxy and only wielders of the force no matter how ""force sensitive"" can wield one properly unless trained from adolescence into adulthood! The weightlessness and gyroscopic effects of the weapons require immense strength and dexterity that can only be achieved through decades of training. They are so stiff and unbelievable on screen I don't believe for a second that they had a falling out because their son became a homicidal maniac. A sixty-year-old man left his wife to act like a twenty something hot shot bounty hunter/swindler again? The dialogue between the two was senseless and empty with no importance or relevance. The only original actor who deserved a place in this story was Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker because that makes sense for him to continue the Obi-Wan role towards a new group of Jedi, but Leia and Han should have been completely dead and out of the picture for this movie. With all that in mind, you have Ray's force powers just maxing out Super Saiyan for no reason to the level of a trained Jedi master! Adam Driver was a horrible choice and had no semblance of a trained Sith as of that of Darth Mal or Darth Sidious and acted no better than another Hayden Christensen emotionally (or acting). Then we have the new Sun-sized death star that Han so comically points out ""We can always blow it up! There's always a way to do that!"".. Are you kidding me? Two of the previous six movies were spent blowing up a death star! What a wasted opportunity for something new along with Han's slap in the dick about blowing it up! Did they think that switching out a two- meter ventilation shaft for a large complex make this story-line anything new or visionary? Harrison Ford only did this movie because they agreed to kill him because he alone realized what a sack of crap this movie was going to be and having his most hated character killed was his act of retribution. Moving on to the ridiculous scene with Kylo Ren and Finn and Ray you have a full duel between a well- trained Sith apprentice and two yuppie nobodies. He literally could have held them both with the force and cut their heads off, and that's disregarding the fact that he could have easily beaten them just based on light-saber skill in a single stroke. He literally could have just killed them with his thoughts. Jesus Christ. Not to mention that the light-saber battles end in some pretty light wounds, no severed bodies or limbs just a few shallow grazes and a few punctures? It should have been a Mark Hamill showdown against a disciplined force wielding Sith Lord and decades-long skilled Jedi such as Luke. All together a bad movie with bad acting, forced dialogue and obviously forced plot points with faded old star wars actors, cheesy ass unrealistic depictions of the star wars universe combined with a reused old script with no ingenuity or vision makes this installment truly horrible and a waste of time, 2/10 all day long or less.
""Don't hold my hand!""- Rey""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I was excited to watch this film given the hype about it and the fact Portman was playing the lead role. but something was missing? story, narrative or context? who knows all I know I was 45 min into this and I was wondering what the hell was going on. I get it, Jackie Kennedy has just lost her husband and the world doesn't seem to give a toss as it puts in a new president to replace him even before she has washed her dead husbands brains out of her hair. they are planning the funeral and all she can do is look for a great place to bury him, some where nice where he will be able to take in the sights at Arlington, news flash Jackie he is dead, I don't think he really cares!. The main problem with this film is the restrained nature of it, is this really how this woman acted after her husband was killed in such a horrific manner? its all to clinical and held together with Vicodin and upper class grace. I understand this movie is touted for Oscar nominations, I understand the nature of Portman's portal of Jackie Kennedy it was amazing given the limitations of what she must have had to work with. I just don't think she had the mindset of Jackie at all, I was not convinced, all I saw was Portman struggling, if this was meant to convey an aspect of Jackie's character then I'm sorry I missed the memo. someone else can love this movie for me it was a part of my life I would like back a long with my $25."Eastwood takes an amazing incident but one from which he cannot make a film without wildly diverging from the facts. Sully is made a persecuted hero as if it was a Spaghetti Western (who was the director again?). The post-crash incident investigation was a complete distortion but necessary to make a story. I really dislike filmmakers playing fast and loose with real life events without any acknowledgement. An aircraft incident investigation is just not carried on as described. But I guess most people don't care as long as they leave the cinema warm and fuzzy. The crash re-creation sequences were incredibly well done though and reclaimed the film."I hate to say anything bad about Hitchcock. He's my favorite director. I have sat through this movie and found it to be absolute dreck. I find the use of the color 'red' not symbolic, not artistic but merely contrived.
Hitchcock's last great film was 'Psycho'. 'The Birds' is quite good, but I can almost feel all the work Hitch and his crew went through to do the bird scenes. The gas station / coffee shop scene is true genius, but Rod Taylor is no Cary Grant and Tippi Hedren is no Grace Kelly.
'Marnie' tries to deal with rape, kleptomania and it all seems as inept as your typical TV movie. Connery is totally wasted in his role. I have no sympathy for any of the characters presented in this film.
I realize some people view this movie as one of Hitchcock's 'greats'. Art is subjective. So if you find 'Marnie' to be a masterpiece, you are right. I find it very dull movie making (it would only get worse with the utterly terrible 'Topaz') and I am right, too.
Hitchcock made so many fine films, I hate to even bring up his clunkers. But they exist. There are some bad Beatles' songs, too. But I'm not going there. Hitchcock was right on his game so much of the time, I simply ignore 'Marnie' because the man was an obvious genius and one of the most accomplished directors in the history of movie making.""This movie is a poorly done rip-off of the movie Gladiator. Some scenes and even lines of the dialogue are clearly taken directly from Gladiator as is the general plot. Some blatant examples of copying Gladiator are the scene where Atticus discusses seeing his family in the afterlife, Milo throwing his weapon at Kiefer's character, they call Milo ""the Kelt"" similar to ""the Spainard"", blood dripping from his hand being the focus in the final fight scene, etc. Unless you for some reason really want to see a volcano watch Gladiator instead, even if you've seen it.
The acting is bad especially by Kiefer Sutherland.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I showed this film to some people who did not know it was Kubrick, so they gave it no extra hype bonus points from the martyrdom of Saint Stanley who died shortly after the making of this film.
Too long. The film is long in every way possible - total duration, scene length, dialogues. People speak slowly, with multiple breaks between every sentence or word, ask a single questions of 10 words over 30+ seconds. Everything is slow and labored.
The film is just slow. There's so much fat in every scene, so much that could be cut without losing anything from this film. Someone walking outside, fine, but 2 minutes and 20 seconds would tell the same thing.
There are very few events in this film. Things happen, but you really don't care about them. There are subplots that have nothing to do with anything in the story. The costume store story has no purpose. Cruise goes to rent a costume from a costume store, the owner of the store sees his underaged daughter having sex with two older men so he traps them in the store and continues doing business, threatening to call the cops. When Cruise returns the next day he sees the Johns leaving the store, thanking the owner, who tells Cruise that they worked it out financially before offering his (still underage) daughter's services to Cruise.
The music is beyond irritating - a single piano note being hit over and over.
So this is a 3 star film. They got some things right, mostly technical things, the acting is not bad, it's not the fault of the actors who did the best they could.
I cannot recommend it to anyone and I regret watching it.""For ages, I had wanted to watch this film as I had heard a lot about it. A lot of that might have to do with the fact that the two stars of the film, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman, were a real life married couple at the time of its release. I usually love Tom Cruise movies but this would have to be his worst film, by far. Totally not worth any hype as it was a snooze-fest, and two and a half hours of my life I will never, ever get back. If you ask me what the plot of this movie is, my response will be a simple shrug of the shoulders. The plot shouldn't even be mentioned as it is non-existent in my view. A 'fun' fact about this movie is it took 400 days to shoot, which is listed as a Guinness record. How it took 400 days to shoot this pretentious garbage is beyond me. Everything about it is horrible, acting, directing, plot, etc. You could tell the actors didn't want to be there with cringe-worthy dialogue. Avoid at all costs and a terrible way to send out a talented filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick.""I hated this movie. The gratuitous use of the N words and the blood-splattering aside, the plot is a drawing room drama with guns and the only remotely interesting character is Jennifer Jason Leigh's. There was such opportunity with these actors and the talent behind the camera, but alas, it was not meant to be. QT is like a teenager who only wants the thrill of a cranium exploding or using a forbidden word. There is not much here that holds one's attention. In fact, despite the richness of the set and excellent lighting, I was still bored by the repetitive dialogue that led nowhere significant and I ended up only noticing the use of the N word. If the inspiration for this film was in fact Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" then it is a miserable fail. The characters simply were not fully realized on a script level. The actors did their best, but could not rescue it from the hands of the naked Emperor-Director; and at three hours - tortured is how I felt by the end, especially with no plot twist worthy of the indulgent film. This is a big thumbs down for me.""This is just a quick review of the film, which I saw for the first time just hours ago. Let's get one thing straight, the movie is a bad film, as you can tell by my rating of it. That being said, there are some good things about it. Some of the special effects are pretty good, and the fighting scenes, when not chopped up in the editing room, were fun to watch. The score is also pretty decent for the most part throughout the film. That being said, near all the performances were awful, say for Dev Patel, who was legitimately trying to make this material work.T The direction and writing from M. Night is nothing sort of pitiful. Half of the film is exposition, and when it's not, the lines are delivered so poorly that you can't get anything from them. Also, having seen quite a bit of the show, let's just say it didn't try too hard to do a truthful adaptation. Anyways, see it if you want, I don't care. 4 out of 10.""There I was, having a really bad day. Made some dinner and sat down to watch something ""funny"". Picked this POS dreary comedy, even though I can't stand either Will Ferrell or Marky Mark Three Nipples Wahlberg. ""How bad can this be?"" I said to myself. Less than 30 minutes later I beat myself with a wooden spoon I used to stir pasta sauce. This is a pointless TV sitcom-level ""comedy"" that features all the wooden forced laughs you won't laugh at. It features heart-warming goop that you will gag on, like half-frozen Eggos with cheap syrup and margarine instead of butter. It features the overpaid and shrill Will Ferrell as a supernice guy who's so sensitive he gives butterfly kisses to his adopted kids. They hate him, and so will you. Ferrell tries so hard to be a real dad to his children by marriage (don't ask why he can't have any kids of his own, the reason is stupid beyond belief) while his wife stands around and mildly chastises the kiddies for drawing pictures of neo-Daddy with poop for hair.
Enter studly no-good ""real daddy"" Marky Mark Three Nipples Walhberg, who wants to reclaim his kiddies by virtue of being a muscleboy who rides a motorcycle and gives out 20 dollar bills at bedtime. Let's not forget he abandoned his kids and wife for selfish reasons. He immediately overstays his welcome, makes sure we see him shirtless, and displays the acting chops that made him famous, like sliced white bread is famous. Obvious rivalry ensues, and you turn off the device you're watching this crap on and are happy it was free. Yes, I'm guilty of poor judgement, but I lived to tell you not to pay attention to this stupidity. You've seen it before. Many times. Ferrell and Marky Mark are past their prime, and this rank exercise in comedy proves it. Ugh.""Its a real pity to see such great actors try and pull this terrible piece of script writing together. The characters (and they are LEGION) have all of the depth of the piece of paper their trite lines are written on. Anna Kendricks character in particular is lacking completely in motivation or explanation, but she is not alone. I could practically feel the actors strain to bring some sense of reality to their roles. The story is slapped together and fairly directionless. Who are these people? We barely understand what anyone is doing anywhere. The concept is a good one and God knows, I love Sam Rockwell, which just made this film all the more disappointing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Note to filmmakers: When you make a movie, DON'T use slow motion for over 80% of your film, especially in the horror/thriller genre. It takes the audience out of the moment, as is the horrid case with the new killer shark movie 'The Shallows'. After sleeping on it for a night, this film might be one of the worst and silliest films to come out this year. It's terrible filmmaking on just about every level. It's poorly written, poorly shot, and doesn't make a lick of sense. Blake Lively, who plays a young woman named Nancy, does a decent enough job with the material she's given, but after reading the screenplay, I would have walked far away from this film and never looked back, even if I got to go to Australia for a few weeks and film.
There's just so much wrong with this movie, it's hard to decipher where to begin, but as a charming nun/babysitter said, ""Let's start at the very beginning."" We first meet Nancy (Lively) as she is being driven to a remote beach to surf while she is on vacation. It is implied that she dropped out of med school after her mother died of cancer (a horrible side story full of cheese). She's being driven through a beautiful part of the forest to get to this amazing paradise view, but you wouldn't know it, because the director has Nancy texting her friend the whole time, while the screen captions are displayed largely on the screen at all times in real time.
The stupid thing about this is that the camera even shows the actual phone screen in frame as well through all of this. We just miss out on all the supposed beautiful shots and cinematography. After a few minutes of this, Nancy is in the water by herself, surfing the big waves, which is when everything become slow motion for the duration of the film. Her hair flings back with water, the waves crash down, and some average surfing maneuvers are all shown in slow motion. I'm convinced that the writer and director here only had enough material for about twenty minutes of film, but made it in slow-motion to drag it out to just over 80-minutes. I'm not kidding.
Soon enough, a big killer shark chomps Nancy on the leg, the blood starts flowing, and she swims over to a nearby small rock for safety, which is about 200 yards from the beach. This is where Nancy stays basically for the duration of the film by herself. Well not really by herself, there is a seagull she names Stephen on the rock with her, who was also injured in the shark attack. No, I'm not making this up. A few people walk by on the beach, but are attacked and killed by the shark, leaving poor Nancy stranded on the rock. Nothing seems to go her way either as she talks to herself or really us, the audience in everything that she does. It's quite annoying and everything just gets sillier and dumber all the way up to the final credits of the movie.
Do I have anything good to say about this movie? Minor things, I guess, including some good use of practical blood effects and a few minor suspenseful scenes with the shark, but that's about it. From Nancy's phone getting internet access on the remote beach in the middle of nowhere, to the seagull that always seems to have the answer, to the 'JAWS' wink where Nancy tells the shark to go screw itself as she shoots a gun - it all just falls insanely flat and makes you roll your eyes and wish you hadn't spend 80 minutes watching this movie.""I am being generous with this rating I think. I am not an extreme hater or an avid fan. I would place myself in the middle of the spectrum. The movie has a really really interesting concept. I really liked the fact that food in the supermarket is kind of a metaphor for the human race (amazing work with the food by the way - amazing artwork there). I like the fact that religion is also part of the discussion etc.
There were more than one times during the first half hour of the movie that I was actually impressed by the metaphors and the plot. After the first half hour though, the movie became a repetition of the same thing, totally predictable, with some glimpses of laughter and went down the hill overall.
The ending was also as pointless as it could be. I think that this was one of these movies that kind of aims to go into depth with things and till a certain point it does, but in the end it goes too deep for anyone's taste.
I would watch it again cause it seems like a movie I wouldn't want to miss, but the feeling in the end is that the movie promised more than it could deliver, or to be on the same context as the movie, it bit more than it could chew!""Akira is a bull.sh.it, an animation movie very poor, it is good only for nerds of sh.it. I'm very disappointed by the review that I have seen before I've seen the film because these was all positive, when the film is only sh.it. I've lost 30 min of my life to see this animation film because the review was all good. I'm very hungry with the nerds that have wrote these reviews, i don't understand how the people can appreciate this kind of bull.sh.it.the greatest sh.it ever truly sh.it a bull.sh.it film that you must see if you wont lost some time with sh.it. the sh.it is sh.it and if you want that, you have found it man. What the f..k IMDb I have written 10 lines of sh.it for publishing my review, isn't enough for you?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Rented this for myself and the parents. Result: snoozefest.
I felt like this movie was made by a new director trying to be Guy Ritchie, not by Guy himself. It would have made a good commercial, though: eye-candy actors, high fashion, jarring action scenes.
But alas there was no point. Who cares? What does a-Paris-Hilton-look-a-like want with a nuclear warhead? Why does this new organization supersedes the original KGB and CIA? The title is misleading. It should say How Two Men and A Lady Become U.N.C.L.E. It doesn't sound all that exciting now, does it?
It doesn't make its mind up on what kind of movie it is. A couple bits of action, a couple bits of silliness, possible romance. If it was a trying to be a James Bond movie, it failed on all counts. I half-expected Melissa McCarthy to jump in at the end. But it wasn't a spoof either. So there, that's my two cents.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** *Spoilers* A man is loading his truck to move out of a cabin and some friends show up to help. One says ""Wow, you haven't aged a day in the last 5 years."" The man says ""That's because I'm immortal. I have lived since the dawn of man and I was somehow present at every historical event and personally knew every historical figure! Let's sit on the couch so I can tell you about it instead of portraying the events like you would expect in a movie.""
They proceed to sit on the couch and the man talks at length. Sometimes the camera cuts so you can see an actor's expression. After a while, I hit fast-forward so I could skip to the part where something happens. They left the couch to take a box to the truck and returned to the couch. The man is still telling this story about how he knows everyone. I fast-forward some more. An ambulance shows up. I assumed that one of the friends faked a heart attack so he could escape this pointless conversation. One of the characters said something about a shooting. Perhaps he shot himself to escape? That makes as much sense as anything else that happened. I didn't dare go back and see because that would subject me to more of this movie.
The man finishes telling his story and is proud to see that his friends all bought it. He drives away in his truck. The credits roll and the crew congratulates themselves on filming the whole thing in a single afternoon. They debate on whether it was wise to blow the whole budget on pizza.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! Do NOT read any further if you haven't seen the film.
Until the last 15 minutes it was one of the best films I've ever seen. The feasibility of the characters is good until then. The ending was ridiculous, I can't believe people suspended disbelief this much. It's one thing to have to suspend disbelief, but the characters at the end are completely unbelievable. Affleck's character would definitely not have stayed with a psychopathic murdering partner. Just ridiculous.
I am astounded other people are OK with the ending. That's the biggest surprise in all of this. Anyone who knows anything about legal issues or psychology will realise how stupid the ending is. I can only think that some people are ignorant to think it's a good ending! Sorry, but that's my opinion. Just awful. Watch it, and then make up a better ending with your friends (maybe that's worth doing for fun!?).""This is a movie that's talked about so much that you practically know it, even if you haven't seen it; it's a pop culture phenomenon. Well, I never saw this movie when it came out in the theaters, don't really know why, just hadn't made the time to see it. I finally saw it (1/25/17) and... man, was it boring. Yes, boring.
The pacing is slow, the acting is mediocre (the mother and father) and some of the jokes don't land. I love the actors in this movie, but it just seems to drag along. The special effects are dated, but rather enjoyable, so I didn't mind that at all. My biggest gripe about this movie was with Beetlejuice himself. For a movie that carries his name in the title and is acted with great gusto by Michael Keaton, you'd think Beetlejuice would be in the movie a lot more. The movie is 1 1/2 hours long and Beetlejuice is on screen for about 15 minutes! His character is not fleshed out all that well, as oftentimes we are left to wonder about his motivation. Is he a good guy, a bad guy, who's he trying to help or hurt? Beetlejuice just acts quirky and rambles on, probably in the hopes that we as the audience won't notice that he's not really doing anything. But again, it's the story itself that fails; it has bad pacing, not enough of the main title character, and ultimately it becomes a boring mess
This is a movie that had great actors, a decent outline for a story and terrific potential, unfortunately it doesn't deliver on any of them. I think I would have liked this movie if I had seen it when it came out and I would remember it fondly and with a nostalgic sense of wonder. But no, I just recently saw it and nope, can't recommend it. As an 80's kid, I hate saying this, but this movie is just badly executed. Sad, it could have really been something, if they had only made Beetlejuice the main character in the movie and fleshed out the story.""This movie, was the worst movie I have ever seen in a long time, I don't understand why go for such a big movie with such a low budget?
Movie Edit ( 1/10 ) Acting ( 1/10 )
This movie was so full of propaganda and so full of unbelievable crap! I regret even watching it so bad, I wish it was so easy to just suicide, I would probably do it this movie makes the world so much more cancer then before, I think I have brain cancer now, this movie is so crap, I can't seriously not find any words of how bad this movie was, it seriously gave me cancer in the brain,
This movie is the worst ever, the director is a complete retard someone eliminate him and everyone in the movie and make us all a favor!
I use to have respect for some actors in this movie but after this movie they are now bottom 1 list""What could possibly go wrong?
The director of Napoleon Dynamite, Jared Hess, teams up with the A-list of Hollywood's comedians in a film based on the largest robbery in US history.
Sounds to good to be true, doesn't it.
What we get, kind of, is like two solid hours of Zach Galifianakis doing his Alan shtick from Hangover. It's bad taste and hijinks and unbelievably bad Texan accents and the neon-coloured Eighties. It's silly, but never acquires enough momentum to be funny.
A classic case of too much of a good thing, really. Maybe Jared and Zach are too much alike in their love of wackiness.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Miyazaki is my absolute favorite director, so it especially hurt to be so disappointed by this, his supposedly last film. It's about a real person, a Japanese engineer who designed WWII fighter planes. Miyazaki loves his flying machines, and this guy, who was apparently opposed to the war, was a huge inspiration to him. But the movie is unbearably boring, and I think a big part of the problem was that it was based on a real person. I mean, a lot of Miyazaki's movies are relatively slow. Movies like Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service feel very pensive. But he's very inventive and imaginative, and you always get that he has something important to say, about the environment, or the importance of self-reliance, for example. But with this film, he was somewhat restricted to real events, and it just didn't feel as flexible or meaningful. He introduced this absolutely bizarre dream character in a series of dream sequences, and I HATE dream sequences. They made the film feel gimmicky rather than innovative.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The original ""8 1/2"" worked because of how Fellini perceived it as an analogy of the troubled minds of great artists. A combination of ego, artistic integrity, mental illness, repression, arrested development and the unconscious desire to be loved and cherished beyond all human incapability. It's a noble try to take the rather obscure Broadway musical hit that had a cult following but was nearly forgotten by the time of its 2002 revival. With so many musicals needing a film version, ""Nine"" was a surprising choice, but having seen the original with Raul Julia and the revival with both Antonio Banderas and john Stamos, I was curious to see what they did with it.
The Maury Yeston score is perhaps one of the most beautiful, complex to sing, and a challenge to any singing actor, let alone a non-singing one. For Daniel Day Lewis to take the part of director Guido Contini on was a delightful choice, and he is excellent. He's a combination of all the aspects I mention in my first paragraph, although his ego is subtle and never makes him cocky. Marianne Cotillard is a perfect choice for his long suffering wife, with Penelope Cruz deliciously sexy as his mistress. All of the women in his 40 years are introduced in the excellently staged opening, with big first shots of everybody revealing something about their character.
The shot of the legendary Sophia Loren as his mother is an emotional one that still has me tearing up. But it becomes obvious very quickly that there is too much going on, and it becomes rather dizzying to try and catch everything. While I like the work of Judi Dench normally, I did not really embrace her as a former Folies Bergere headliner, and would have preferred Chita Rivera in the part. Dench sings acceptably as do a good majority of the non- singing actors, but she just wasn't right for this part.
The musical numbers also worked better in stage, and ""Nine"" should be more than just a two hour music video with occasional dramatic scenes edited in. But I can't fault director Rob Marshall who tried to strike ""Chicago"" magic again. The film doesn't flow all that well, and there just seems to be just a desire to see the film make its point and move on. Some aspects of it really prove the idea that this is not going to be a movie musical that one would want to see over and over again. Intentions are right, but something of a spark is definitely missing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie, for some reason, was rated 80%+ on that Rotten something site which fooled me into it. To sum up in few words. It's cheap, boring, predictable, disgusting, idiotic. It's like a Tarantino wannabe just finished a mediocre film school in Canada and then was able to lure the government people who has no experiences in film industry to give him some subsidized money to produce a low budget pointless movie just so that they can promote the location where the film was made. If some point in your life loved watching the Japanese-made Power Rangers or some kind of low budget candy super heroes thingy, this might be the movie for you. But you also have to like some disgusting things like blood and gore too, because this Tarantino wannabe made blood splashed like the waterspout in Yellowstone. Human's organs was cut and throwing around like it was supposed to be funny. Well, yeah, if you are a fan of Happy Tree Friends. The only thing that kept me watching this is the bimbo robot that made me slightly wondered that she might be hot in real life. Sometimes, there are movies you think they are not worth spending money to watch, this one was not even worth your time. I think some people rate this good just because they are nostalgic about the idea of 80's apocalypse, which was executed badly, or they just simply sadistically sick people.""I'm just gonna be honest and say that this is Pixars worst film they have done, in my opinion. While the voice acting is good and the CGI is fantastic, the story is awful and flat out kind of stupid. This film is absolutely NOTHING you would expect from the first film. That is because this film is a spy movie. And not even a good one. The plot is extremely generic and dull. And it just makes you think ""Why does this need to be a spy movie? In what way does the first film transition into a spy movie?"" It doesn't make any sense and the idea of a movie revolving around cars being spies is just silly, and frankly, stupid. This film is such a letdown from the first film, that I don't even know if I can recommend this to anyone. I just hope Cars 3 will be better.""This 2006 film by 20th Century Fox is a fantasy that has a little education and history. I don't know that children (and older) will retain much, but the scenes of different museum windows provide the occasions for some science and history to take hold. What one might enjoy the most in this film is the masterful camera work and special effects as the clay or model characters come to life.
The film has some light humor as well as mildly scary scenes with a T-Rex dinosaur on the rampage. Ben Stiller is OK as the main character, Larry Daley. The rest of the cast are good in their roles. It's light entertainment, but nothing worth going out of one's way to watch. Most kids would probably enjoy it. It might be a good baby-sitter movie.""Les Miserables in one of the best stage musicals ever made. Unfortunately, the transition to film on this occasion was poor and surprisingly, the cast was about 70% of the problem.
Val Jean should be a powerful voice that projects intensity and wisdom. Jackman was light-musical and it really didn't cut it....
Crowe was wooden and completely miscast. That's a part that a good actor could flesh out, but Rusty was complete underwhelming. His voice was nothing to right home about.
Marius, Enjorlas,... fairly weak when they should project a bit of power and substance. Anna Hathaway was OK, but the part of Fontine is strange. It does not feature in most of the show, yet often draws praise. Didn't deserve the Oscar.
The most dreadful aspect was the Thenardiers. Sasha and Helen BC had limitless opportunities to give a great injection of comic relief and really have fun with it. Instead, they ended up totally stale, uninspired and somewhat creepy. The actors almost skipped over (Rather than emphasize) their great lines.
In the end, this was a real disappointment for someone who was a big fan. Didn't even think much of the sets and staging. What they should have done is made a movie using a good ensemble cast built of Les Mis stage performers from around the world. Bringing in the big names actually backfired on this occasion.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Fight Club is that one film you always hear about in colleges and universities, hailed as some sort of 'stick it to the man rebellion' story with all these pretentious meanings that apparently need to be analyzed in great depth to the point where I can't start a conversation about films without hearing Fight Club come up at least once. Pseudo-intellectuals, perverts, frat boys and emos all get obsessed with this one like moths to a flame. Of course, it would be the most spoiled, coddled and secure of society's demographic that enjoy Fight Club because they say it speaks so much to the hurt and anger they apparently experience on a day-to-day basis. I'm sure they'd change their tune and perhaps value humanity over themselves more if they'd grown up in earlier eras, but that's getting rather off-topic.
Fight Club is not a terrible film. It has interesting characters, a decent plot and it follows the original book very well. The soundtrack is dated, the themes are dated, the dialogue is vulgar simply for the sake of being vulgar, and the entire thing as a whole is just trying way too hard to appeal to a certain type of entitled, self-absorbed and immature Generation X/ Millennial crowd (although really I think films are subjective and can be enjoyed by anyone). Fight Club is offensive in every sense of the word, disgustingly crass at times, weird, overly long, and yet I still liked it - but I think it's incredibly overrated for what it is, and I don't think the viewers of it really seem to grasp the full idea it was trying to put out there.
The film is more or less a very nihilistic portrayal of a young man rebelling against modern corporate capitalism and society in general by forming an underground fight club with his SPOILER ALERT!!! imaginary friend and alter-ego Tyler Durden. Durden is a character, but at the same time an embodiment of everything bad, wasteful, annoying, volatile, cruel, narcissist and utterly pointless albeit intellectual that the main character himself is putting out into the world by his own attitude. Anarchy and rebellion, and the aftermath of them, remains one of the biggest themes in Fight Club alongside being an entertaining comedy. However, many viewers of the film just pick up on the vulgar one-liners about women and masturbation and sex, the heavy violence and Tyler's selfish view that humans exist to please themselves, not to care about others, and that the world, everything and everyone in it is just a game to be played. Viewers of Fight Club I've noticed retain the idea that if you show emotion, compassion, pity, sadness or kindness, you're an overly sensitive baby. ""Real men"" cause chaos, have sex constantly, swear their mouths off, go out of their way to offend others and don't give a damn about anyone else but #1. And naturally, when the main character grows up and matures slightly in the end, people find this confusing. Basically, the main character thought he knew how cruel and ugly the world was, but he was just a bored kid and a hypocrite. In fact, the majority of young adults are hypocrites who think the world revolves around them and their views. I was that way when I was that age, too. I went through a ""pro-pollution"" phase where I littered on purpose and refused to recycle. Why? Just to stir up trouble. I went through a goth phase where I wore black lipstick and thick black eye makeup to make a panda bear green with envy. Why? Just for shock value and to tick off my teachers. I went through an emo phase, cutting my arms with plastic cutlery and dying my hair black with pink streaks, listening to depressing music and whining about being depressed, while the popular blonde cheerleader sitting in the desk next to mine really WAS suicidal and it went totally unnoticed. Why? Because I was too wrapped up in my own teenage angst garbage to bother helping anyone or anything else. I wanted attention, I wanted to be noticed, but looking back on it a few years later, I realize how insignificant it all is. All teenagers are dumb. I have never come across an intelligent teenager. I've come across many intellectual teenagers, but not intelligent ones. Durden is exactly the figure most teenagers, teenage guys and college guys especially, emulate.
...Okay, that's really getting repetitive now. Like the films 'Donnie Darko' and 'A Clockwork Orange', I think the themes of chaos, nihilism and anarchy are important, but Fight Club is so overrated for what it is. How it has such a high rating over films like 'The Killing Fields' and 'Threads', I'll never understand. Reviewers keep raving about its aesthetics and its depth, but it's no more deep than many other films. ANY film with a social commentary is considered ""deep"". Fight Club I think just hit the world at the right time, plus it's making a comeback for many nostalgic hipsters, so it will definitely continue to be highly regarded for many years to come, which is not necessarily a bad thing, yet Fight Club shares what, exactly, with the world? Young adults are jerks? Have I missed some vital bit of info to make Fight Club so popular and beloved, or what?""This film is insanely boring, superficial, dreadful, hideously unfunny, dull and sterile, absolutely depressing, obnoxious and such a meaningless crap.
The pacing is horrible. The directing is horrible. The plot is idiotic. The dialogues are idiotic. The narrator is annoying with his stupid comments. All characters are dreadful, boring, unlikable and shallow.
This film is only for delusional idiots who enjoy watching pathetic and depressed girl doing pranks on depressed people and humping the first male character she encounters. 'Romantic' scenes in this trashy film are even worse then 'romantic' scenes in any other low budget x-rated film.
Here is my honest advice, don't be fooled by tons of moronic positive reviews and just skip this pathetic film.""The owner of a small cable channel in Toronto becomes intrigued by the salacious bits of kinky sex coming over from a station in Pittsburgh via an unauthorized satellite dish--actors pretending to be whipped and molested. He soon finds out these people are not willing participants, and that the subversive channel he's intercepting causes strange and dangerous hallucinations. Inscrutable nonsense from writer-director David Cronenberg, whose daze-induced pacing seems drug-addled and self-amused. Still, the filmmaker's loyal fan-base (as well as many professional critics) defend the picture as something profound and meaningful, so personal taste will have to determine its ultimate success. James Woods does give a low-keyed (for him) and interesting central performance. The outrageous special effects by Rick Baker run hot and cold. *1/2 from ****""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I wanted to watch this movie because the brief description interested me. I always enjoyed films and games set in this era (like The Order: 1886) and books by Jules Verne, even though I didn't know this was one of his works before. But I didn't like this film.
I can't decide who they were trying to appeal to; there were childish parts and quite adult parts. There were childish ""hilarious hi-jinks!"" as in Home Alone 3 like Jackie Chan losing his pants, getting stabbed in the backside, gross-out humor, and an over-the-top main villain who sometimes acted like Jim Carrey's Grinch (see the final scene for an example). And there were also more adult parts like Fogg eyeing Monique's legs and up her skirt, making out with her, and lots of martial-arts violence.
Some parts were very annoying or predictable. Jackie Chan's character lies to Fogg in the beginning, and of course he gets found out later and of course Fogg gets all mad at him and after what seems like forever, forgives him again later in the movie. As another tired plot device, Fogg cuts it really close to not making it back in 80 days despite seemingly having plenty of time to do so, then gets told he lost and everything stops for an agonizing minute and then he suddenly finds he won after all. Cliché Disney film. I watched it mostly to the end (fast forwarding through some parts) because I wanted to see him successfully circumnavigate the globe, but his success felt empty because we had just been told that he lost beforehand. That's bad writing.
There were some charming parts to the movie, Jackie Chan's action scenes were good, but everything else was bad. I wouldn't recommend it to the children I know or anyone else.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I wanted to like this movie because, well, its Ghostbusters, and I adored the first two films. In addition I enjoyed Melissa McCarthy in Spy and Mike and Molly so I thought it might be a enjoyable tribute to the original movies, or at the very least a fun waste of time. I suppose I should have known better,I herd about the dislike of this film, but although i didn't disregard it, I didn't take it as gospel either. Then there was the whole sexism angle to some of the criticism of the film, which Sony milked in order to generate more of a buzz. However I don't believe that the gender of the characters mattered a whit. If the four leads had been men the movie would still be as abominable, because the film is creatively bankrupt.
Leslie Jones's character is a wince-inducing stereotype of a black woman. Melissa McCarthy is obsessed with food,(soup plays a running, ah, ""joke"" in the film) I'm guessing because her character is overweight, Wiig and McKinnon were both very blah. Helmsworth's character is a complete dolt and the villain was utterly forgettable. The plot is atrocious, and the story dull. The films throws plentiful, though, quite frankly, not very good, special effects at the viewer in the hopes, I guess, that one forgets the banality of the film. In the original you got the feeling that the actors got along off-screen and the interaction between the leads had warmth. In this film the warmth seems lacking, and the movie suffers. One horrendous scene involves one of the ghost busting team eating Pringles while investigating a call. This scene was particularly grating to me. I thought at it was first because, certain sounds bother me. Thinking about it later, though it was the product-placement that hurt more, the dialogue about the chips was unnecessary and could have been scrubbed from the film. Gentle reader, I warn you, stay far away from this wretched mess.""Gerard Butler plays an ex professional footballer trying to kick-start his life in America by becoming a sports presenter and be near his son.
Butler plays George Fryer, who played for Celtic, Liverpool (he was there 'at that famous night in Istanbul') and also played for his national team, Scotland before playing soccer in the USA.
A bit like George Best he has lived the good life and is now short of cash and in order to get closer with his son, he coaches the kids soccer team which means all the soccer moms wants to bed him. Butler still carries a torch for his ex wife who is planning to marry someone else.
Butler enjoys playing a footballer who is a babe magnet much to puzzlement of his landlord who is always chasing him for the rent. Butler displays an easy charm but there is very little original in a story where the women are shown to be shallow and vapid.""I rated this movie 3 because of the story. The other aspects deserve a 8 whereas the story is worth a 2. And that's because for me the story of a movie weighs about 80%.
You're supposed to enjoy a movie. ""Knock Knock"" makes you feel... annoying contempt. It's almost obvious that this was intentionally. If they can't trigger proper emotions to the viewers and they know they can't, at least trigger whatever, just trigger something. That's low.
I thought Keanu Reeves movies are great but I got the feeling he was used - he's forced through a bad script all along. His acting and that of the other actors is nothing to complain about, in fact they are more than believable, carrying the disastrous plot on their shoulders.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Well the fact is that from time to time I have put it at home, even knowing that I did not like the movies, but I feel like watching an adventure movie and I say come on, I'll see the. The problem is that in a while I start to get bored I start to see that I do not like anything like this carried, that does not catch me. It should be a movie with the typical values ​​of friendship, honor, courage, but apart from having great fights and adrenaline rush through your veins. I should create a spirit of wanting to enter the adventure to the end, no matter what I do tomorrow, but when you think that you have to endure this nine hours to see what you think, if it were another movie if but not this one.
I had a complete material to create a world at his feet, to do what I wanted, had money to do everything and for my taste has not got almost nothing. I do not think he took advantage of all the material he had. I do not think he took advantage of the spaces he had. The possibilities were immense and it remained in a simple film.
The photograph is very well, telling that there is no plane touched by computer and with the means that he can not.
But the management does not get me to catch. I do not believe that fascination that adventure movies created for me years ago. Let's not talk about plans. With that material, he only knows how to make airplanes or close-ups. How can you make an adventure film in the foreground? He does not know how to compose plans, he only knows how to make general plans or close-ups.
Of course the makeup, the hairdresser and the dressing room is spectacular, but there is a lot of money behind.
I will not make the criticisms of the other two because they will be like that, I will only say that I was watching the second part and it seemed that I was filming in Aranjuez, not wanting to disparage Aranjuez and the third I do not know how many endings , But too many. When it seems the end has already come, go on and on and on and on and on and up seven times.
Anyway, I must be me, I imagine you will all be against me, I'm sorry, forgive me the fans of these films.""I've not read the books but if the film is anything to go on I won't be rushing out to buy them anytime soon.
I know this is a dystopian story set in the future but I can't class it as a Science Fiction movie as the entire story concept is implausible. I cannot believe the human race would reduce itself into five factions which are segregated by a test, but then they get to choose which faction they want to join. Not only are the factions designated by job, but by uniform, colour, and even their homes. They are not allowed any personal items as that might bring forth human nature.
Imagine Humans being Human, what a notion!
The acting is just okay, even the bigger name actors, Ashley Judd, Maggie Q, Ray Stephenson, and Kate Winslet couldn't lift this film out of the morass the story and direction placed it in.
I don't know how they could've made the movie any better other than a total rewrite and refilm.
However, the action sequences aren't too bad except for the fight training... doesn't anybody remember Martial Arts in this stupid, segregated, and insanely dull future world(?)
I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone. There are loads of better films out there, go watch Hercules starring Dwayne Johnson, so much more entertaining.""The Resident Evil series jumped the shark with Afterlife and I thought Retribution would be just that: retribution. I thought they'd use this movie as a means of making amends, righting the wrongs, correcting the blunders and all that good stuff. Instead they laid another egg.
Again the acting was poor, the story half-brained and the fight sequences putrid. There was nothing redeeming about exposed gun fights with high powered automatic weapons yielding no target hits (besides the faceless goons), or the slow motion, bordering paranormal fight sequences that were horribly choreographed and terribly executed. And is it too much to show someone actually running when they're running? You know: arms moving, head bobbing, face contorted with heavy breathing and other known characteristics associated with running. Instead we get glamour running. Hair neatly flowing in the wind, face at ease and arms and legs moving symmetrically all in slo-mo.
This movie did nothing to atone for Afterlife. This was no retribution.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Back in the summer of 2013, I and a group of friends went to our local theater and we decided to see World War Z, I had seen a few trailers and it did look good, so I went in with an open mind. Needless to say, when I left the theater, I was massively disappointed. From its weak story and characters to its numerous plot holes, World War Z is a truly bad summer blockbuster.
The film begins with a retired CIA agent named Gerry Lane living a peaceful life with his wife and kids when a zombie epidemic hits their city and forces the family to seek shelter in Newark, there Gerry's old CIA friend, General Umuntoi arranges their rescue, but the house is invaded by zombies and they barley manage to it make out and are then transferred to a carrier group anchored off New York City. Now, Gerry must travel the globe to find a cure and stop the zombie epidemic.
Although I've never read the book that the movie is based off, I'm surprised the most fascinating elements of the book that weren't included in the movie were the exploration of how the zombie outbreak touches social and governmental foundations around the globe, but since Paramount and Marc Foster wanted to go for a more generic action movie, all the interesting ideas that the book had got tossed out the window and the PG-13 rating reflects that by throwing all the things that have become the trademarks of the zombie genre into something more watered down for family audiences and the action scenes that we do see in the movie are incredibly unsatisfying.
I'm flabbergasted by how cheap the film looks considering the 190 million it took to make, but when you watch the movie, it's hard to tell where all that money went because the zombies look incredibly fake and given the movie's desire to stay away from blood and gore, the only features that divide these zombies from people are cloudy eyes, gray skin and an affinity for showing and snapping their teeth. These aren't the hungry for brains zombies that we see in many other zombie movies and when viewed from afar, it's difficult to tell the zombies from actual people but even later on when they are shown in their passive state, it really shows how little the filmmakers know about how zombies work. The lurching and shrieks are intended to be frightening; however they come across as more comical than anything else with their teeth clicking, head banging and jerking resulting in some unintentionally funny moments.
Much like The Patriot, none of World War Z's characters are written well or have any complexities leaving us to not care if they live or die. Brad Pitt's character is a happy family man which is not only unoriginal but it fails to make him likable not to mention his marriage and daughters feel incredibly fake and ready-made that I could care less if Brad was ripped apart piece by piece by zombies in front of his family and it wouldn't have made any difference. The other characters are no better, just showing up when the plot requires they do or they serve no purpose to the overall story like a neurologist who does nothing but spout tasteless allegories about the weather then is just killed off because the film-maker clearly wants to put our hero in a dangerous situation.
There are numerous plot-holes in the film too: Zombies are able to identify a fatal illness just by gazing at a person and will evade that person for unknown reasons which make no sense, if a doctor with years of therapeutic education can't be able to do that without extensive experimenting then how would a mindless zombie be able to figure it out and second, why in the hell would a zombie avoid an ill person? The World Health Organization in Wales has a baseball bat in its weapons vault, does Marc Forster not know where Wales is, and were there no cricket bats around? The cell phone battery is proclaimed dead, yet in a later scene, it's working again. Seriously, Foster, seriously?! When the team decides to regain the aliment samples, they don't give Brad any instructions about what containers have what inside, but evidently one container is full of stuff that could kill him instantly. Really, really?! Also, Brad has no combat skills, leadership skills nor is he a doctor in this movie so why is he being tasked with leading this mission when there are far more qualified men then him? It doesn't make any sense.
Of course, I have to bring up the ending. Just when you think the plot can't get any worse, the film takes a down-hill slide in the last 40 minutes. We see Brad playing hide-and-seek with the zombies. There's absolutely no tension because the ending is declared 5 minutes into the scene, Brad goes to the part of the building that's crawling with zombies, get some aliment samples and return. They'll use one to contaminate themselves and see how the zombies will react. They of course don't, and Brad returns to his family and with a hollow speech about this isn't the end but only the beginning. Easily one of the worst movie endings ever put to screen!
Now, is there anything good in this incoherent mess of celluloid? Well, Brad Pitt is great in it and while I'll say that this isn't his best movie, he's in no way bad or even just run-of-the-mill, he's great for this kind of role and he pulls it off quite well even if his character wasn't interesting or likable. The other actors are trying, but the script doesn't allow them to be as good as they could have been. But outside of that, World War Z isn't worth your time. Go watch The Walking Dead instead.""The film, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a big budget snoozefest that is a boring watch and a really poorly made movie. While the film is sharp looking and the period costumes and sets look great, the film is hard to watch. The film is way too long and self indulgent on the part of director/leading actor Kenneth Branagh. The film is more horrible than horror and lacks the proper tone or narrative to pull this material off. There is a lot of stuff that should have been on the cutting room floor and a more subtle approach to this would have gone a long way to making this a better film. In this instance, less would have been more. Instead, Brangh thought big and the film is a terrible disjointed mess. This epic piece of big budget garbage has little in the way of horror and is more of a period melodrama with bad storytelling, big scale swashbuckling action, a bombastic score and hammy acting. None of which does the material any favors and is a pretentious mess. In addition to dropping the ball with the direction of the film, Kenneth Branagh stunk it up big time with his lousy performance as lead Victor Frankenstein. But don't just take my word for it. Both screenwriter Frank Darabond and producer Francis Ford Coppala have each come out publicly to disavow the film. The film flopped in the US when it was originally released theatrically and had Francis Ford Coppala directed it as planned it would have been a much better film and a companion piece to his awesome Bram Stoker's Dracula.""I laughed a couple of times at the octopus, but otherwise this was tedious stuff, the worst kind of baby-food: sugary and cloying. Is this really the same company that brought us the wit and wisdom of TOY STORY, WALL-E or UP? If so, it is unrecognisable.
All that technical know-how, all that talent, wasted on this sentimental slush.
I know, I know. I obviously left my sense of humour outside the cinema. It's making the company a fortune, so what do I know? Evidently not much. All that matters is that the children love it, right? Who cares if it pickles their imaginations by conjuring up a non-world, something that could only exist in the swarming collective brain of a gigantic corporation?
I recommend running early Pixar or classic Disney for your young ones. They've stood the test of time, which FINDING DORY will inevitably fail on account of its unacceptably high sugar content.""From absurdly over-blown ""plot"" to clichéd endless swearing, guns firing at anyone but not hitting ""him"", the unbearable lead actor, this film is a disgrace.
If you watch it you want the so-called baddies to kill us all. I'm ashamed to have watched most of it I wish I hadn't, I just kept thinking, no this can't be happening ?
I'm also sorry to all the non-western viewers who might think that in anyway that's we ""we"" think they would be capable of.
Interesting to read a long list of goofs (I think that means errors in baby language) Someone said just watch the trailer ... its more than enough.""Hi folks.
Don't even bother with this one.
Possibly one of the worst films ever made! I really can not understand why it has so many good reviews? I was looking forward to this movie being released, but then I just could not wait for it to end. Why make a PREQUEL when it adds nothing whatsoever (than confusion) to the 1982 version? The characters are one dimensional and have no depth; a far cry from those in the original movie (who all have their own distinct personalities etc). How can anyone compete with Kurt Russell in this sense? Annoyingly, the 2011 version includes females in the cast which totally destroy the alpha-male-animalistic-bond between the original personnel.
The soundtrack of the original was a demonstration of pure genius. Ennio Morricone mixes 'minimalistic' (writing) analogue synthesizers with beautiful 'contrapuntal' String scoring. Every single note composed is 100% within the context of the theme of the movie. Marco Beltrami obviously has a prolific output having scoring for may horror movies, most of the 'remakes'. However, this one just sounds over-scored, noisy, distracting and may have been written for something Hollywood-ish like ""Titanic"".
With all the SPECIAL FX available today, the best they could come up with is 'monsters' which look completely false/unrealistic. Think back to the original ""Alien"", ""American Werewolf"", ""Poltergeist"", and you might agree that, for their day, their authenticity was par excellent; unlike this 2011 release of ""The Thing"". Bring back John Carpenter please.
Might suit a young teenager audience with very limited knowledge or lack of insight into this films genre.
A complete waste of time and money.
Hope this helps . . .
Best.
Paul David Seaman (UK)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I admit to being a huge geek when it comes to UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE. I've been watching the TV quiz show for years and try not to miss a single episode. You could say that I'm addicted to it. This is why STARTER FOR 10, a film widely advertised as being about a young man's emotional development and his participation in the longest-running TV quiz show in the UK, appealed to me.
Having just watched it, I can report this is a crushing disappointment, quite simply because it's a dreadful film. The story is nothing more than a very typical romantic comedy with a love triangle basis. I despise these kinds of film and their attempts at warmth and humour and STARTER FOR 10 is no exception. James McAvoy stars in an early role and is quite unconvincing here, but then it doesn't help that he plays a thoroughly unlikeable character.
Elements of the film dealing with UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE are limited to about 20 minutes screen time max, most of it at the fumbled climax which abruptly ends with no follow-up or fall-out to the events we've just witnessed. It's a cheat, in other words. Elsewhere, we get the usual leftie political subtext (railing against Thatcherism, etc.) as well as the somewhat worrying message that it's okay to beat up Tories if they annoy you.
Some of the supporting cast members are interesting (Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic Cooper, and Rebecca Hall are all fine given their parts) while others are so bad that you wonder how they were cast (James Corden and Catherine Tate are the offenders here). I was very sad to see that old-timers Lindsay Duncan and Charles Dance are brought in just to shoehorn in an embarrassing nude joke ripped off from AUSTIN POWERS. It's that kind of film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I think that the title explains a lot about what I mean to say. This film is a total rubbish: not only because it tries to use Computer Generated Imagery to compete with Pixar's masterpiece The Incredibles (released a year before), but because it has also a rubbish story. I mean: Walt Disney himself tried to adapt Chicken Little in 1940s and he failed pretty badly. So, why Eisner decided to make a full-length movie about this story is a mystery: the book from which this piece of junk has been adapted is very poor and very childish, unsuitable for Disney. But then again, Disney came from a period of turmoil and wanted to try something new (Atlantis and Treasure Planet aren't very Disney-sh?, so I may be able to understand why they decided to give credit to this book. What I refuse to understand is the fact that script is almost inconsistent: I mean, where is the plot, if there is one? Even the best topic in the world (a father-son relationship and its troubles) has been thrown in the bin; this is a film without ideas, without soul, without... Just without: in my honest opinion, Disney could have lived happily ever after without this piece of junk. Honestly I think this is the worst film Disney has ever made: yeah, this is even worse than The Black Cauldron: that film, at least, had a shred of a story, had a ""plot"". What does this movie say? What message delivers it? ""Anybody can be mocked to Death by everyone, but when the time comes they will have Revenge?"" Or maybe: ""it is not important if you are a bully like Foxy Loxy: in the end you will eventually be transformed in an harmless person""? Or perhaps: ""you may be the worst parent in the world, but when time comes your son will inexplicably understand and love you?"" What's the point????""Chances are if you've made it to this third installment of the ""Divergent"" series, you're pretty 'allegiant' to Veronica Roth's teen dystopia books. Or you just like watching the sweaty shirtless backs of Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Either way, no judgment here. I voluntarily watched it.
Director Robert Schwentke returns to the series after making ""Insurgent,"" which he handled with acceptable competence. In ""Allegiant,"" he gets an even lesser script to work with and can't do much of anything to counter how far-flung the story has gotten at this point  both Roth's actual story and the film's reworked version of it.
With the goal of turning around these films annually, the studio turned to new writers and asked them to not only adapt the series finale, but split it up into two parts, and only write part one (as far as we know). This task, given to Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (""Exodus: Gods & Kings,"" ""The Transporter Refueled"") and Noah Oppenheim (""The Maze Runner"")  and possibly another writer who didn't end up getting a credit on the film  pretty much writes the film's death sentence.
""Allegiant"" the book has its problems, as Roth cracks open the world she intricately built in the first two books and places her characters in an almost completely new world with whole new stakes. We follow Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) as they break out into the ""fringe,"" where they eventually discover the Bureau of Genetic Welfare and learn of the circumstances that led to the development of the world they were born into. During their field trip beyond the fence, however, war looms back in the city where Evelyn's (Naomi Watts) Factionless are at odds with those clinging to the old way of life.
Despite a couple different story lines and a large portion of the story that splits up Tris and Four (which no Hollywood studio would allow to happen for a significant length of screen time), there really aren't two good movies worth of material without expounding significantly. Rather than adding compelling new material, however, the script just draws out certain inevitable ""twists"" from the book and ensures the story's plot points play out in action-friendly ways. Actually, almost the entire plot of the book gets used except the ending, which is lopped off to make room for a rousing fourth movie that has no precedent in the novel.
So not only is it a forced script (Jeff Daniels is awesome when he gets the dialogue, but watching him in this versus an Aaron Sorkin project is like night and day), but it deviates enough from the book to confound the only people still watching the series  the book's fans. Not a wise choice.
""Insurgent"" nearly zapped the film of any character-driven elements and in ""Allegiant"" there's almost none of them. The best opportunity Woodley gets to act is a weirdly long decontamination shower scene. The script doesn't entirely lose the conflict between Tris and Four, but it's short-lived and ineffective. A plot device rather than the core of the narrative.
The first-person perspective of the novels was always going to make these films difficult to adapt. It showed with ""Insurgent."" But the quality of the popcorn-munching elements drops off in ""Allegiant,"" in part due to fatigue and in part because the story doesn't resemble its former self. The story and backdrop can change if the characters' journeys stay intact, but that was already falling apart before cameras rolled on ""Allegiant.""
You'll be ready to be done with the ""Divergent"" series come the end of this one, and seeing as it's the third film in a book trilogy, you kind of expect to be relieved of that burden, but alas. Whatever Lionsgate/Summit can throw together for ""Ascendant"" won't be worth watching, save for the final moments so fans can have *some* closure.

This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....
This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.
Before I start to take apart this movie (sadly, I sense I have to do that), I will give a recommendation to people who like movies with much music in it. And also, maybe to the audience that appreciate all types of musicals. With that said... well.... Here I go again.
Russel Brand. Tom Cruise. Alec Baldwin. Catherine Zeta-Jones. Paul Giamatti. I have one question for you: Why?! Why in the name of Steve Perry did you stop believing in yourself? Was the paradise city taken as we built this city... on disbelief? Come on.... just hit me with your best shot, at least... Or is it more than words to shout out loud that I wanna rock? 'Cause this musical has had its final countdown, though it tries to be any way you want it. And Kevin Nash; even you deserve better. There is greater acting around WM, WWE and TNA so... go there instead.
I tried to watch this (yes, you read that right: tried) with an opened mind for let us say, 4 minutes. The dull acting from the main characters blended with a total lack of display for the naive rock mentality made me say out loud: ""What in the world...!?""
One good thing about the motion picture is that there is some kind of an objectivity in finding some jokes here and there. (Often, even they just fall down and leave a tired mark for the history to pick up. The humour during this kind of rock flick must have been the first thing that came to the writers mind. Do you guess that it is bad?) The songs and the rock is taken so far into the polished pop culture that I would say that they have ruined big rock giants. That is a sad fact. I myself is an rocker and loved (and still love) much of that music that ""made history stand out"".
Justin Theroux, Chris D'Arienzo and Allan Loeb. Did you maybe think that the blockbuster from 2008 needed a more rock solid alternative to the audience? With all respect for Björn and Benny, I've got two words for you (and the intention with those are bad): Mamma mia!
Though... a little nice nostalgic road throughout the songs. Just wonder how they could forget about one leader into the rock ages... spelled with a T and an O, then an T and an O.
Last out... I have to throw and give a nod to a dear friend of mine... you know who you are (read also the review of ""Stranger Things"")... don't stop, Steve Perry... hmm... continue believing well.... 2 hours and 5 minutes into this....
I am now finished with this review. If you think that I have been thundering down on this production, all I have to say is; Every rose has its thorn.
Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Good colours. Good sound....well.... you decide. The make up is sometimes so bad that it screams for attention. Look at Paul Giamattis hair; oh, my lord! - The actors : Yes. that is the questions. Even with a solid ensemble of actors I ask myself: Adam Shankman, where did you leave them? Where are they? - Entertainment : It is entertaining to write a review to get this off my chest. - Age : 15. Can come down to 11 in some circumstances.
4,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am trying to keep from falling asleep from this boring, stupid, stupid, did I say stupid movie. Asinine, ridiculous, this movie could be renamed, ""How to bore your audience to death"" or ""Movie for braindead corpses"". I feel stupid for watching this so called 'movie'. And I am watching it for free and I still want my money back. Terrorist groups don't need any old torture devices, they can use this movie. Bad acting, check. Stupid plot line, check. Very big, gigantic plot holes that make absolutely no sense, check. You don't care if everyone in the movie does a horrible, painful death, check. Through out the movie you will roll your eyes, sigh heavenly, saying things like ""Why are they doing that?"" and ""That makes no sense."", check. **Spoilers, you knew the one chick was going to die when they got on top of the wall. No bullets hit Tris or Four although they were being shot at at close range and with machine guns, and they didn't get shot as they climbed up the wall. Despite the land outside the wall being completely jacked up from nuclear war, the land is completely toxic, yet people are able to survive on the fridges in tents!!!Where were they getting food and water!!! These people are supposedly exposed to all kinds of toxic fumes, toxic land but they all look normal!!!? Oh, but the Genetic Manipulation place was able to survive the nuclear fall out and create a grass growing (again ON WHAT IF THE WHOLE WORLD IIS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!!!) And the motivations for the characters, stupid, stupid, stupid. David, who you KNEW and the new section were evil. Absolutely nothing shocking. You knew who was going to die, you knew who was evil. And why did Four go back to Chicago? And how did he survive walking through the nuclear wasteland with no issues!! We are living in the last days, common sense is out, insane people rule the world and make the movies. Finding an actual good these days is like trying to find the holy Grail or a needle in a haystack.""The people at Disney are smart when it comes to making money. They knew that when ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" was a real financial success, they could do the opposite thing and it would also bring in more bucks. And it did. However, the story has a big problem, which is mentioned by others. Everything is predicated on a baby, getting to be 100 feet high, reacting to things like a baby would to colors and light and interesting objects. The problem is that the joke gets stale about half way through the movie. When the little big guy becomes a threat, it gets sort of serious. It's up to Wayne to figure something out. If you don't want to use your brain at all, go see this. Otherwise, save a few buck and check out something with a little substance.""you all so ill. They won't need to know who is hutu or Jew, is capitalist or which religion, for now its simple. They know who is evil. And all feel comfortable with it - even you know: the final will be the best cure for you. It has began yet. digital eternite. ccardnumbers, ip, amazon, google, social cookies, ... . @IMDb IMDb violates people with this movie. Someone looks around for a nice movie and one click ahead gets a trauma. IMDb should be banned by search-engines, better get convicted by law, best get by people what they deserve.
Advertising such things is not only a legal question. It is a moral one.
It is nothing about tolerance, if ruthless not tolerate dignity. By advertising you help cruel growing, you offer capital. You give a civil platform to cruel.

But there are borders - not discovered - results in finding yourself in a minefield""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The most striking thing about this film, for my taste, is how slow it is. Count, does not count much. Trust in your faith and in that although you do not have a why the end as you like and that's it.
Science fiction I do not know if it is because of the four effects that put you throughout the film and then in the end what you have spent in 3d, but in reality it is neither more nor less than a movie that is not going to any side.
There are many minutes of film left. Lots of TV plans.
The actors are all contained, which in part is normal, they are not counting much.
Photography is not bad, but nothing special.
The management, telling that he does not tell much, that he does not know that he is boring, that he does not know how to make beautiful or compound plans, which is not a wonder.
In short I love science fiction, but when they are science fiction films.""A few things here and there that were funny, but overall a poor remake of the original. Special effects were not bad, but this is about 90 minutes I will never get back.
As man, I did not find the film offensive or a male bashing film. I just found the film boring. The first two at least kept my attention, this one did not. Glad I watched on a premium channel we have and did not pay $10 or so for a ticket. It just seems like they were reaching to click like the original four did.
The plot was OK, but again it was just an attempt to remake the original with a few twists. It had potential, unfortunately it failed to recreate the fun the original movie had. The best part of this was when the final credits rolled.""Haven't reviewed a movie for ages but felt obliged to do so with this turkey. I came into this film with no preconceptions as I'd somehow missed hearing about it and had no negative opinion of Keanu Reeves (That's normally the best way to see a film). But right from the beginning I was plagued by the feeling I'd seen it before mainly because of all the clichés. Keanu is just awful don't know if it was his fault or the leaden script. Apparently the scenario was rewritten several times. So it ends up a little bit of everything CGI, real history, bolt-on American Hero, meandering plot, ho-hum romance. If you want to pass the time with this movie may be count the times you are reminded of other better films.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is one of the many movies that try to discredit religions by showing characters who don't understand religions and are full of doubts as a consequence. The movie doesn't attempt to explore their doubts but just leave them be. Furthermore it portrays Christians as religious fanatics and Muslims as much more peaceful than what is historically accurate. In fact, this movie strays so far from real history that it disappoints me how Hollywood is full of people who have jumped on the left-wing bandwagon. They twist the truth in order to appeal to generation snowflake. These people and mainstream media are a major part of the reasons why so many young people have been brainwashed.
The characters are way too predictable and are not at all complex. The plot and lines are so cheesy that I felt embarrassed when I was watching it.
Nevertheless, this movie has good graphics. Eva green is really attractive.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I may be in the minority (lol bad puns), but I was less than impressed with the film ""Minority Report"". I wasn't bothered by the fact that the movie deviates from the short story of the same name by Philip K Dick. I was looking forward to seeing how the concepts of the source materials could be explored in new and interesting ways as well as with more action scenes. Unfortunately, what we got was a standard action film that pretended to be more intelligent than it actually was. John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) is a detective who works for a special agency called ""Precrime"", where he helps prevent crimes before they actually happen using the predictions of a group of psychics known as ""Pre-Cogs"". The movie briefly touches on the moral and ethical principles of such an organization arresting people who haven't actually committed any crimes when Anderton finds his own name selected as a future killer. From that point on, Anderton is hunted by the organization he used to lead in some of the worst chase scenes I've ever seen. In an attempt to make Anderton look cool, they make everyone else look incompetent. To prove his innocence, Anderton attempts a ridiculously convoluted plan to capture one of the Pre-cogs in order to prove his innocence. This fails and ends up having no impact on the plot other than having the pre-cog become a character. Eventually a conspiracy by the agency is exposed and Anderton manages to clear his name by proving that the Precrime unit was a stupid idea. This whole movie just talks in circles, making simple ideas seem complex and deep. Most of the scenes serve as nothing more than showing off the futuristic environment, where you can't help but think that the future has way too many unnecessary advancements (talking cereal boxes?). Minority Report talks a big game, but fails to deliver anything of real value other than the aesthetics. This movie defines style over substance. Don't waste your time with this trash. There are better action and Science Fiction Films out that deserve more attention than this one.""Review: This is another bad live adaptation of a Disney classic! They definitely should have made the dragon speak, like Dragonheart, and I was surprised that Pete was able to fit into normal life so quickly, after living in the wilderness from 5 to 11 years old, with only a dragon as his companion. Anyway, whilst on a day out with his family, Pete (Oakes Fegley) survives a fatal car crash, which kills his parents and leaves him stranded in the wilderness. Out of nowhere, a big Green dragon saves Pete from a pack of wolves, and they instantly become the best of friends. From there, I would have liked to have seen how there friendship developed but the director chose to jump six years into the future, were Pete hears construction workers, chopping down some trees. He is soon gets noticed by Natalie (Oona Laurence) who points him out to her mum, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) and they decide to take him in. Whilst getting used to normal life, construction worker, Gavin (Karl Urban) sights the dragon, and he instantly sees it as his enemy, so he tries to capture the friendly giant, with his fellow workers. Pete, who named the dragon Elliott, misses his close friend very much, and Elliott constantly seeks for him in the night. When he finally finds him, he see's that he has settled with his new family, so he goes back into the wilderness longing for his close friend to find his way back to him. Meanwhile, Gavin is adamant about catching the dragon, so he continues to try and find Elliott, even though he has the ability to disappear. Anyway, Grace decides to take Pete to see his dragon, with her daughter Natalie, and her father, Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford), who tells stories to little children about seeing the dragon when he was in the woods. Meanwhile, Grace's boyfriend Jack (West Bentley), who happens to be Gavin's brother, gets a note from Gavin saying that they are going to the woods to hunt for Elliott, so they all head out to the wilderness with different intentions. After Gavin finally achieves his goal, Pete & Natalie fight to save Elliott, with the help of Mr. Meacham, and Pete soon realises that Elliott can only survive if he sets him free. A weird but magical tale of a sweet relationship between a dragon and a little boy, who lost his whole world at such a young age. Personally, I think this movie was a bit too serious, and with all of the technology that is available nowadays, the dragon didn't look that spectacular. I also wasn't that impressed with the plot, which seemed weak and lacked wit, and I did find the little boy slightly annoying. Anyway, it's worth a watch, because of the touching relationship between Pete & Elliott but it could have been much better. Average!
Round-Up: Although this movie made a profit at the box office, I personally think that people rushed to see it because it was based on the Disney classic, which doesn't mean that it's a great film. All of the actors put in a decent performance but Robert Redford seemed a bit distant throughout the film, which was surprising for such a veteran in the game. Anyway, this movie was written and directed by David Lowery, who also brought you Deadroom in 2005, St. Nick and Ain't Them Bodies Saints. I'm surprised that David was given such a huge project, because he hasn't actually had that much success in the directing chair. That's not to say that he done a bad job with this movie but I really think that it needed an experienced director to bring this magical story to the big screen. Anyway, is a great film to watch on a family day out but I was expecting more of a spectacular visual experience.
Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $142million
I recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/family/fantasy movies, starring Bryce Dallas Hoard, Robert Redford, Oakes Fegley, Oona Lawrence, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Marcus Henderson and Aaron Jackson. 4/10""Good actors gave terrific performances in a disappointing film. There really isn't much of a story. The film is just an extended chase scene and the little mysteries it presents along the way aren't very compelling. The weak ending reminded me just a bit of Netflix ""Stranger Things"", except in this case the Upside Down could be called the On Top.
Some critics described the film as thoughtful scifi (I guess if it's not based on a Marvel Comic, they think it's deep and meaningful), but it was pretty thin - all atmosphere with no underlying theme or substance. It's not up to the level of a really thoughtful scifi film such as Arrival, which leaves its audience contemplating how language can not only be a barrier to communication, but also shape and limit our perceptions of reality.
I had great hopes for this film because Nichols' earlier, ""Take Shelter"", was an insightful exploration of the onset of schizophrenia and its impending disastrous impact on an individual and his family.
But with ""Midnight Special, it seems as though Nichols is devolving rather than evolving as a filmmaker.""You know? The thing I most value when I am watching a movie is the chance that catharsis could happen. Something that happens in very few occasions but something that I chase frequently. Then there are the movies that leave me lukewarm, which are the majority. Then there is Irreversible, which provoked in me something resembling an anti-catharsis. I would never have imagined such a rejection for a movie, such a feeling of dirt. Did the movie want to explore the limits of cinema? He succeeded but at the expense of cinematography. I would encourage anyone to ignore such a bad taste movie. The end is not justified. The means are not such. There is controversy and morbid about this film but it has nothing to do with art, I think.""This is of course the film that brought a young Anne Hathaway to our attention, featuring her as an average teenager realising that she's actually the Princess of a far off land. And Julie Andrews is your Gran!
This is a fun film. It's got a good heart and will appeal to young girls and teens everywhere. A big part of that success is down to it being well directed by the much missed Garry Marshall and the fact that it features winning performances from Hathaway and Andrews.
I don't think it needed the sequel that followed, but this is an hour and a bit of entertaining fairy-tale fun.""I had high expectations for this film.
A fine cast, great story and more. However, I have to admit the film did nothing at all for me and it took me three attempts to sit through it. I finally managed to watch the entire film the other day. And boy was I ready to see the credits roll! The music score in my opinion added to my misery, the acting was very staid and cold. It wasn't ""stiff upper lip"" British, it was bored actors trying to be even more boring. I gave the film 1 star. Watch the film if you like confusion, flash backs, grey atmosphere, no tension or need to fall asleep. And if you like the film then fine, if you don't then I told you so! Within ten minutes you will know if you will watch the rest.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I saw it in the cinema years ago, I thought it was very bad and I wanted to see it again to do a review with fresh ideas. I have seen it again and it seems very bad. The reasons, some in zone spoiler and some not.
I do not understand how films that defend violence in such a radical way can be so successful.
All the actors are very well, well except one that we do not see anything clear.
The picture is fine. But the address leaves a little to be desired, it's too simple. The struggles are not well rounded, you can not see anything.
Soon I will hear again that video games of violence are bad for children, which I do not agree with, but we do not wonder if telling the children that democracy must be destroyed is not bad.
Spoiler
For starters I do not understand why for some things, if you create what interests you but for others not. For example, to tell us the story creates an incredible situation as one of the freer, more cultured, better democracies has become a dictatorship, of course conservative. I could not take it to a country as there are still many with established dictatorships like Cuba, Korea, Venezuela, etc. Or maybe the reason is that I wanted to call the government of the moment, dictator, which is why I choose myself.
It creates a second story of the most typical. Since I am not an atheist, priests as always are pedophiles.
I am very grateful that the protagonist is watching ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". Do we want to compare a man who fights for his private property in a totally different moment of history with someone who in the 20th century is dedicated to killing people and destroying things that belong to everyone?
Then we have Natalie Portman that at first seems, as any person offended by violence, but then when anyone would have been very angry about what makes it happen V and yet he falls in love with him and it is she who bustles the congress .
The policeman, who defends the law and at the end let Natalie lower the lever.""Great actors in this one but maybe for them, it was to fulfill contract obligations. There is plenty of violence and guns, but the actual story-line and plot is hard to follow. It makes little sense and not much fun to watch for a long time. I did make it through the whole film just to see what happens. The only thing I was really looking forward to was Alice Eve in some type of sexy dress, bikini, or even nude. No such luck there. Costner does a fine job but not at the top of his list. Jericho's(Coaster) memory is very messed up and that is basically what the film is entirely about. It is another adventure into ""fantasyland"" for thrillers, but what is new in that. The submarine shots and missile launches look nice but hen again there, nothing new.This is a 2 hour film that in my opinion, isn't worth the time. There are other films in this mode that are much better to spend time watching. I just saw it on DirecTV so at least I didn't have to open this much time and money in a theater to see this.""I am a big fan of the Underworld series. I have watched every entry at least a dozen times, and own the whole collection on blu-ray. Naturally, I was comfortable assuming that would have some bearing on my enjoyment of this movie, and I could not have been more wrong. It's not even that this is just a bad Underworld movie, it is a horrendous movie all by itself. This movie has the worst plot, dialogue, acting, action, and just about everything else that I have EVER seen. My best friend and my wife, who I unfortunately took to see this monstrosity in the theater, have now banned me from picking the movies we go watch. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.""Hi folks.
Don't even bother with this one.
Possibly one of the worst films ever made! And believe me, this is so dreadful. And what a shame because I thought K. Reeves was excellent in ""THE DEVILS ADVOCATE"". Dreadful acting all round.
Here, he gets conned into letting two stranger girls into his house. This is the main plot and from this point it goes rapidly DOWNHILL. If you make it this far, this your one opportunity to either turn it off or walk out.
This is NOT a HORROR movie for sure. But rather a lightly entertaining thriller of sorts.
Might suit a young teenager audience with very limited knowledge or lack of insight into this films genre.
A complete waste of time and money.
Hope this helps . . .
Best.
Paul David Seaman (UK)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The plot of this movie isn't very problematic to understand, neither are the various symbols and meanings in it.
What is problematic, is the l ng scenes, where nothing much is happening, except from the weird music-score, making you feel uneasy and tired of the film.
I don't care if people claim that it's artsy, it's not, it's just lazy and bad.
The whole think could have been over in 45 minutes and no one would have lost anything special, instead they have dragged this film out....and out...and even more out.
Scarlett Johansson acts impeccably and she looks great, natural and it's cool that she actually was ""under-cover"" while driving around.
However, the film fails for me in many levels; The dragged-out scenes, the way it was shot for the most part (bland, grey, dreary scenes with cheap equipment), the rather narrow plot and general lack of anything interesting happening. Combined with a horrible music-score, the experience wasn't very good.
The contrast between the black liquid and space-ship-scenes and Scotland's greyest, rainiest, darkest areas is so large that it seems like there are 2 movies in one. One shot by a team with an actual budget, the others by a team of film-students.
I like that S.J had the balls to involve herself with this project, it shows that she is an actress that isn't afraid of doing something else than Hollywood-blockbusters.
Just wished she chose a little more carefully next time, because Under the skin isn't really a particularly good movie at all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I was very disappointed that The Rock's character didn't actually turn out to be ""that cool guy,"" the trailer was misleading in that regard. I just thought his humor/character remained weird and uncomfortable. The Rock is a really funny actor but this movie just didn't let him do that, and it was almost unbearable to watch his talent go to waste. Kevin Hart was great but I've just seen better characters from both of them. Just unfortunate. The reality that his character didn't evolve as much but just became better looking may just be the point that sometimes that happens, and that that's okay is fine by me. It doesn't fall under the stereotypical movie that suddenly he is the coolest person. I just wasn't hoping for that to be the case. I'm not positive what I would have done differently to make it closer to my vision.""This was an awful movie and I must have checked my clock 50 times hoping it must be almost over! This is the most depressing movie ever made! Did the actors in it do well? Yes! Each one portrayed their soul sucking, make me want to kill myself roles perfectly! Wow! I absolutely believed they all hated their lives! Seriously, maybe I don't watch movies for the same reasons other people do but I want to be entertained or informed or at least moved! Again, the actors in the film are incredible! They truly delved deep into their roles. I just don't want to sit through a movie that every character feels like a Dementor from Harry Potter! When they are on screen, I feel cold like all the happiness in the world has been sucked out and will never return. Instead of watching this crap, go out and learn how to make a hangman's noose, it'll give you the same feeling!!""I have a general rule of thumb about movies and find it actually works. IF IT IS UNDER 2 FULL HOURS, WAIT FOR THE RENTAL TO COME OUT. Which puts all 90 minute B movies in the ""do not start the car"" category. What's missing from this for a guy? The basic ""shock & awe"" boys look for, this has none of that and I myself KNEW ""this is going to turn into a WAR when she finds out what he did"" within the first hour. Sure enough, after she did find out how she was awakened and why, it was like watching a married couple!
In other words: NO SURPRISES HERE! But that's not all... 1) Sci-fi Roomba's, seriously? Got them on Ebay! 2) Bartender on wheels? Did it in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 3) OH, yet another food processing console? Star Trek! 4) But he did NOT get incinerated in the tube because he HELD A DOOR PANEL OVER HIMSELF AS A HEAT SHIELD? Wait... what? 5) You need special permission to get the computer to try resuscitating someone? Oh yeah... now there's a security risk waiting to happen! 6) NO reentry into hibernation? DUH... otherwise you wouldn't have a movie! BUT... why would there be no SPARES on board when in fact they had spare reactor parts IN PULL-OUT DRAWERS??? Now it's getting STUPID!
While we're on that.... was this ship created by the Star Wars Deathstar engineers? Because for something to BE out in space for 120 years with 5,000 bodies on board.... you think the company would have gone through some ""what if"" wargame scenarios BEFORE putting 5,000 customers lives at risk? But I guess if you're not gonna see any of them again since you'll be dead when they awake, WHY GIVE A SH|T?
Which is EXACTLY how you'll feel after viewing this film.""The Plot.
Boston, 1926. The '20s are roaring.
Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world.
Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops.
Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw.
But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover-can be trusted.
Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death.
Too bad Afleck is the worst actor on the planet.
And a poor director.
And he can't write.
The movie sucks.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Movie started with a nice music which reminds you that you are still part of harry potter universe. Then comes the big bad dark wizard to show his presence. The movie then takes a softer turn and introduces ""Newt"" (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a bag full of beasts. A British in America. His acting was actually quite good. The beasts of Newt were visually spectacular and interesting.
Then the dark mass was brought into story and Colin Farrel was after it. He was using a young boy to catch the mass to gain more power (can't tell you the whole story, can I?). The whole part was boring.
Along the story line, Mr. Kowalski's character was introduced. His love story and mix up in all the magical story was better than most of the movie (including the magical congress of USA).
What I liked most? Visual effects were very good and keeps reminding you of harry potter. The love story and humor of Newt and Mr. Kowalski was good. Revealing of the dark wizard at the end and the actor who played it was the best part. Nope.not telling you who he was, but he booked me for the upcoming second part of the movie.
Overall, I think it was a bit of a disappointment. But the acting of all the characters was not bad.""This movie would have the potential to be entertaining, if it were geared towards adults and not children or feminists (which are the same thing)
How bout a nice unrated cut, with some blood, cursing, and boobs? Not to be mistaken for: 'politically correct speech', 'politically correct violence against males only mostly white', 'cock shots' which somehow are sneaking into pg-13 titles lately...
No? Okay. My money says it's not good enough to be spent on this. Somebody spent millions though... hope it was a good return... Maybe you should cater to your target audience and not twitter trolls.
Gave it a 3 for featuring government conspiracy and a white male protagonist being the victim of a government conspiracy; finally a bit of realism in the femiNAZI driven Hollywood.""First five minutes I realized that most of this film is done on a green screen with a parked car. I skipped a chunk to middle of the film to see if it was worth to stomach through. Unfortunately I ended the film at this point. Very low budget, poor acting. I have never seen the original death race, but i have seen the last three of them. Little upsetting that this film used there name and was such poor quality. I wish my thirty minutes of my life could be returned to me. If you like the other films, stay far away from this feature. You will not like it at all. This belongs in the mystery science film comedy show, that would make this film enjoyable!""And Stumpy Jeff Bauman is a fraud and deserves death for his treason along with all the other treasonous goofs who played roles in the Boston Bombing Hoax.
Go search Boston Bombing hoax and read up .... it will not take long until you see how phony and staged this event was. Nobody died and nobody was injured all just prior amputees playing injured with fake moulage. BTW many many jews were involved in this event, but i'm not surprised as they love to be involved in these type of frauds.
Stumpy Bauman can be seen with a little plastic hose coming out of shorts which spewed fake blood onto the ground .... even a real surgeon commented on Stumpy Baumans fake injuries by saying that if they were real he would have been unconscious and likely dead from blood loss.""There are some very poor films being made nowadays that resort to silly or gratuitous violence (if there is such a thing) with stories that are pure fancy and do not reflect the times or anything close to it. Overlay that with patently fake explosions and special effects that just cheapen the film and you are left with something that it is easy to walk out of at half time. I had just had enough of the rattling machine guns and stupid macho posturing.
It becomes very annoying when you see how much money is spend on this tripe when they could make more films like Robert Redford's ""The Company you Keep"", for example that has no special effects just clever and thought provoking dialogue.""""La La Land"" is NOT a top-notch musical in the company of great musicals like ""West Side Story,"" ""An American in Paris,"" ""Gigi,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" (I could go on and on). It's a wanna-be musical that seems to owe its appeal by being seen as an homage to these earlier musicals -- without being a worthy musical on its own merit. Apparently, given its high rating, it's also being rated by people who haven't seen these great musicals (to realize how bad ""La La Land"" is).
On the positive side, Emma and Ryan are very nice ""eye candy"" and do some nice acting which helps to redeem this movie from being a complete waste. But this is a MUSICAL where leads need to sing and/or dance. And perhaps our culture has gotten so used to watching non-singers sing and non-dancers dance in TV shows such as ""Dancing with the Stars,"" that it's completely appropriate to have the two leading characters be people who can neither sing nor dance. But let's not pretend -- Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling cannot sing or dance.
Musically, there really isn't a ton of music. Although it started off looking like a musical with a big production number, there's very little music in the middle of the movie. A few of the songs are appealing, but none are show-stoppers or particularly memorable (no one would hum a tune from ""La La Land"" when leaving the theater). And although musicals tend to have songs that reflect the story-line, ""La La Land"" has mostly done away with that convention. (Oh, that must be why it's gotten awards!) Instead, we have a few songs used as themes that are repeated in the movie.
What about the story? It's really a fairly standard romantic trope, but without the standard ending. (Oh, that's got to be worthy of an award!)
The movie is also rather long -- someone should have edited it (a lot). The cinematography seemed fake (too much color?), and I hated the camera work -- hand-held dizzy-work in some scenes and too too many close-ups of Emma.
Most people feel compelled to see ""La La Land"" given the number of awards and nominations, but it's not really worth the time. Go rent ""Grease"" or ""Cabaret"" instead.""It's (I think) commonly known that the Resident Evil series aren't very good movies, but I must say that this one is laughably bad. The plot is terrible and some events just occur without any meaning. That being said, the plot is also very predictable. You know what's going to happen minutes before the actual moment. The acting is mediocre, no real outstanding performances, but the movie doesn't make that possible either. The movie could be acceptable for fans, but I can't understand that you can be a fan of this.
I thought that it was my duty to mankind to write this review about this absolute piece of garbage. The movie producers should never ever make a movie about this topic again. Please for the sake of the people who like to watch movies DON'T.
To finalize, I'm a frequent moviegoer, so I have some material to compare it with. This was my second 1 I've given (other was Snowpiercer). Hopefully this review will withhold people to watch this movie and they won't spend 15 for this like me.""Two dimensional characters, hackneyed plot and plot devices, very unrealistic pretty much everything including the behaviour of the main villain - Anthony Hopkins must be ashamed for having a central role in this movie.
I can hardly find anyone who could enjoy this movie. It's not for adults, that's for sure, because its love story is just too simple and repulsing, however the young might enjoy it for its reckless car chases and kisses, fist fights and chivalry.
I pity everyone who starred in this movie. It could have been a very average straight to DVD B-movie but given the range of actors it's simply unwatchable.
This could be a perfect product placement movie on a par with the Fast and Furious franchise. This movie and this franchise share a lot of common. Missing realism is their common staple.
The final twist couldn't save this movie. It just made it even more sickly-sweet.""You know how bad pizza is still good pizza -- and certainly better than no pizza at all? Yeah, well, the same doesn't apply to Dan Brown adaptations.
Scorching betrayal is not just the premise of the plot but also how we are being treated by everyone involved in the makings of this ridiculous, implausible, nonsensical garbage.
Langdon, AKA 'This Generation's Indiana Jones Wannabe', has effectively been reduced to a morose, incompetent idiot who, after everything he's been through, after all the double- crossing, riddle-solving, backstabbing, running, shooting, burning, chasing, STILL cannot put two and two together and figure out who the 'bad guy' REALLY is within the first couple of minutes of the film.
THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN ALL THREE MOVIES!
Who keeps watering this plant? Who keeps feeding this Gremlin after midnight?
Infuriating that the story demands the reader/viewer to dumb down just so they don't outsmart the 'expert' protagonist from the get-go, thusly rendering the actual viewing of this respawning absurdity entirely unnecessary.
Dan Brown should stop. Ron Howard should stop. Hans Zimmer should stop.
Tom Hanks should self-flagellate 20 lashings, cast regretful eyes downwards while chanting 100 Hail Marys to his tear-sodden shoes, brand his forehead with a hot iron spelling 'ИƎVƎЯ AᎮAIИ' so he can remember every time he looks at himself in a mirror, AND JUST LET THIS FRANCHISE DIE ALREADY!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Such a bad movie. Will Smith playing a bad guy just can never happen yet it was attempted in this movie. All you get is Will Smith being Will Smith. The down guy who has a kid trying to make a living.He means well and he cares about his daughter as he is a weekend dad.
Dialbo ( the fire guy) has the power to destroy everything yet he wants to be good wants to do good and dose not wanna use his ability for wrong.Turns into a big fire thing an then dies. WHAT!!
Slipknot how long was this character on screen for? He appears out of now were and then dies. Soon as you see him you know he is there to die the first.Sort of a oh the thing we have on you works look.
Harley Quinn-its as if they said to Margot Robbie just walk around in hot pants and say your lines in a soft girly voice . Done ..
Leto-has to go down as the worse Joker ever.Rock Druggie with daddy issues.The laugh WTF!!! The Joker is not rich he dos not drive expansive cars and he dos not chill at nightclubs with other bad guys. The Joker is fared by everyone. Eyebrows were raised when Leto was announce as the joker. When people saw what he would look like you just knew it was gonna be a bad movie. Leto just dose not strike fair he is that soft cute rock singer.
The Movie was made for the pop people of today.So no real backstory action and one liners. By the end the bad guys are shown as heroes. It was done for the Harley Quinn wannabes (mostly every girl who likes to dress up) . It felt like a teenage movie with old actors trying to be young or think hey this is my chance to be a comic book character . Now we all know what they can or should never be a comic book character.
The end of the movie scene were they kill the witch how long did that slow mo go on for? it has to be the longest slow mo in movie history.
I voted 1 as there is no 0 option..""*** This review may contain spoilers *** My three stars go solely to Emily Blunt who plays the character Rachel. She is the only character who was actually developed with any insight at all and I contribute that to Blunt's acting skills! As for the other characters and plot itself...yeesh.
I read the book before the film, big mistake!! HUGE!! The book is written so well and the plot twist of Tom being Megan's lover was so blindsiding. The film made it obvious from the opening scene.
Also I found that certain traits were either under or over-developed within the characters. Rachel's drinking was glamorised by the odd cocktail she sipped on at a bar, where as in the novel she is an actual addict. She wakes up hungover, she experiences withdrawal. You gain an understanding for the disease of addiction that this film skirted over.
Tom was too dominating as a character. Good actor, crappy portrayal. Tom is depicted as kind and lovely in the novel and especially kind and lovely to Rachel even though Anna hates her. Yet in the movie...
Speaking of Anna, where did her backbone go? Her character is far prouder and happier than this woman on the screen. While she is suspicious and neurotic where Rachel is concerned, she also adores Tom and yet that connection didn't seem there.
Megan also disappointed me. In the novel she is very, very complicated. She loves Scott but is weary of his jealousy and his desire to have a child. Thus driving her to an affair. She is terrible but you connect with her nonetheless because there is something so endearing about her tough brokenness...and yet in the film I didn't really care that she died. I mean it was sad but I didn't connect with her, she was so cold, I wanted to connect, to understand her but I just couldn't.
Don't even get me started on Cathy, not enough energy or time to waste on such a poor portrayal of a character.
On to the plot. It was so very inconsistent! I do understand why- because the novel deals with the thoughts of Anna, Megan and Rachel, so I see how it would be hard to visualise such thoughts and I appreciate how they used an AA meeting to explain some of the memories Rachel had, but so many important details were ignored. If Harry Potter can successfully be made into a film , why is it that a thriller with fewer details cannot??
Since when does Rachel draw? and what purpose did it play? Scott's freak out was so subdued because he and Rachel never slept together and he always seemed on edge already so whats a new little expression of his anger? ALSO WHY IS KAMAHL WHITE???? WHY? He was meant to be the most attractive and exotic character in the film. He was described as beautiful multiple times by both Megan and Rachel! Why was I given a white dude with a crappy Spanish accent??? That was reason enough to deduct a star.
It feels like they skirted over so much. Honestly it's like seeing a kid try to colour in a picture: all the colours are there and you can see the picture itself, but everything is just not quite in the right place and the colours aren't always in the lines.
Im disappointed.
Do yourself a favour, read the book. I read it knowing who the killer was and I didn't feel like the story was ruined. DO yourself a favour and get to know the actual characters because they are so well developed.
Pros of the film: Rachel,how Tom killed Megan,how cute baby Evie is
Cons of the film: Every other character (all of them), rushing through Megan's story, the final scene where Tom tries to kill Rachel.""Do NOT watch this film if you're planning a road trip through Texas. It might scare you to death, as some of the scenes are extremely horrifying and disturbing. After watching this film, I couldn't get those ugly images out of my mind. Those who have seen this movie will know exactly what I'm talking about. The terrifying events are disgusting and cruel.
The violence is nightmarish and will possibly keep you awake at night. In any case, you'll need a strong stomach to get through this movie. Sometimes violence is necessary for plot development.. But this particular type of violence is probably the ugliest I've ever seen on-screen.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Stone does a disservice to future generations by putting his own spin on important national topics. Is there some truth to his stories, yes, but mostly he creates hyperbolic and personal views of his subjects as if he was a comic strip creator, not a movie producer/director. The intelligence community is pretty anal when it comes to security. If you've ever worked in the field they usually put up a lot of fences that prevent getting anything done. That a system engineer is able to steal the information snowden he did is very perplexing but there's been little media attention to this. Anyway, snowden is portrayed as this supremely intelligent hacker with unique access to programs and data. I don't know the real story but what I've seen of snowden in interviews is not very impressive. The bit about putting a towel over his head to protect his passwords had me rolling on the floor. All the tech talk and exaggerated capabilities of the nsa/cia is hogwash made up by someone ignorant of the field. It's just that kind of ignorance that has created a huge industry for consumer data protection and given the green light to the govt to waste billions of dollars every year on useless programs. Consider the DNC hack as an example. This was all human error not some sophisticated tech hack as covered in the media but you bet software security companies will make a mint off this. For a better idea of the truth behind the programs snowden complained about, read bamford's books.""The original Trainspotting was One of the most stylish, iconic, shocking and funniest films of the 90s decade - now its back with the same cast and director and based on a novel by the author of Trainspotting. What could go wrong - well everything really. This film is a lazy sequel where the only good points are the nods it gives to the original. Anyone who hasn't seen the original will wonder what all the fuss is about as T2 is like a cheap TV movie. No humour, average acting (at best), forgettable soundtrack and weak story. The original was imaginative, almost artistic- well it was about heroin after all! T2 in comparison felt like a cobbled together load of weak comedy sketches. By the end I couldn't have cared which characters lived or died. This sequel I predict will be soon forgotten about and then we can all get back to talking about how great the Trainspotting was. Danny Boyle has made another dud film although I'm sure he'll earn lots from us nostalgics. Choose life - choose another film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The Bye Bye Man is a master class in ineptitude.
Poor writing leaves us with under-developed characters whom it's impossible to care about, which waters down the already contrived and predictable ""scares"".
With the exception of one particular scene involving Carre-Anne Moss and an interrogation room, the acting is pretty awful, actually causing me to laugh out loud on several occasions.
And let's not forget about how bland and unoriginal this thing is, either. The Bye Bye Man himself is a guy in a hood and....that's it. Sometimes he'll point at one of the annoying characters. I'm almost insulted at the fact that director Stacy Title thinks that this will scare audience members.
I suppose it's not all bad, though. The film is at its best during the third act, when it goes into full-on thriller mode, and actually kind of works...until the credits roll and you realize how many lapses in logic and the sheer amount of plot holes that exist in this film.
I could probably go on a lot more about how terrible this was, but I think you get the point.
All I can say is, Don't see this film. Not even die-hard horror fans like myself will find anything to enjoy here.
2/10""This is not a love story. It's clearly a political act, a carefully planned operation to promote ""desegregation"" and ""racial mixing"".
We can clearly see the results of this vast operation that was conducted in late 50s and continued to be conducted to this day by the powers behind the curtains. And this is not a conspiracy theory.
The government want people to mix and to create some non-specific race which would be neither black or white or Asian. They want a race without an identity that would be easily manipulated and ruled, since all mixed people are placed ""in between and nowhere in particular"". All mixed people are pulled apart between cultures and are forced to choose.
Have you noticed how ALL.. not some but ALL mixed children even if they are really light skinned.. ALL of them consider themselves to be BLACK.. or at least not WHITE
For instance take Alecia Keys or Halley Berry both mixed fair skinned and really good looking. Have they ever addressed their WHITE heritage? Never. They present themselves to be black. Period.
So don't tell me about any love stories about a white guy and some black chick who fell in love. This is total utter crap.
I wouldn't believe for a second that there were no good white girls for that white guy to love and take care of. All of it is forced and planned.
And today it's a trend among famous actors.. to get hitched with black chicks. Take for example Bill Burr, he married this black chick who by all standards is not very good looking. Of course, the beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.. but please look at this seriously. Bill is a famous guy, he is Irish, he is funny. And what does he do? Marry a black chick as if that is the final choice he fell in love with? Please, don't insult my intelligence.
Look at how many black and Asian kids are adopted by really famous and rich white actresses as if they have nothing better to do. It's not a coincidence that ACTORS adopt non-white kids. It's obvious that THE ACTORS are being forced to adopt non-whites, and in exchanged they are given HIGH PROFILE ROLES AND PAID for such convenient politically correct behavior.
And there is no doubt in my mind that Bill Burr got all his ""comedy specials"" and all the roles in the movies, since he married a black chick which suits the political agenda so conveniently.
Only the actors who behave in a PC way get a break in show-biz. No doubt about it. It's clear as day.
And look at a lot of other famous actors and you would be surprised that many have divorced their former WHITE wives and married someone of non-white race. It is a trend and it is a STRONG trend.
Hollywood is seriously trying to push such behavior as something good, since it's always shown in such a way where the evil local government is against interracial relationships and the all good and fair federal government fixes the problem by making a Supreme Court decision.
This just shows that the federal government have been taken over by psychos and communist who wish the white race goes extinct.
There are videos on the internet where you can hear Jews in particular talking about how white race is evil and that it should be exterminated and NO ONE charges these Jews with any kind of law suit. There are black people also who say the same exact things about white race.
The Jews and black hate white people. It's not the white people who hate the Jews or blacks. We don't really care for either Jews or blacks and if weren't forced to live with them side by side, we would have even better safer and prosperous lives.
But government doesn't want this. They want all whites to interbreed with black, so all people in the land would be colored.
And take a close look at how colored people live and what they are capable of when there are no white people around to help them.
They are worthless. Period. The same with Jews. Same for all colored. They are aggressive and non-inventive.
And the irony about this, that if you speak about this subject you are called a racist. But it's the truth. If the truth must be called racist for some insane reason then yes.. i'm racist i guess.
But then again.. is it racist when Jews and black talk about the need to exterminate white race?
Who is really THE RACIST??
There are only 300 000 000 white people in the entire world.
And there are 6 700 000 000 of non-white people.
And it's racist for the white people to want to stay white and stop racial mixing?
Someone must be insane in here. And it's not me for sure.
And may I remind all that most of art work and science works have been made by white people.
Isn't it strange?
The reality is such that white race is being killed.
And hypocrites have a nerve to call white people all kinds of bad words in the dictionary while most of the atrocities around the world have been done and still continue to be done by non-whites.
When I see interracial couples I think something went wrong. It's like seeing a white person with a terminal disease.
All the virus wants is to kill you. And non white blood is the virus for white blood. And there is no politically correct way to talk about it. It's the fact and it's the truth.
Of course this review will generate a ton of butt-hurt. Sorry about that.""First it must have been written and shot with a female lead, right? It is 2015 film so cliché of the decade reigns. Second the clone storm trooping soldier looks nothing like his ancestor Third the clone storm trooping soldier shoots exactly like his ancestor and every other soldier of the empire: in all the wrong directions and with zero skill Fourth they build another death star with the same stupid fault that has been proved in all of universe to cause its destruction And remember JJ directed so even if he had not been lazy and missed all these elements he would have picked up the script at the hasidic accountants office so it would be written not for art, love or message, but for cash. End of the line for Star Wars""For anyone still dreams about the old glory days of western colonization when Caucasians traveled around the world to ""teach"" other ""primitive"" people how to behave like human and not apes, this film may just be the perfect wet dream they crave for - only this one is made by a Chinese director who tried too hard to appease the western appetite of being the knight in shining white armor. Otherwise, this film is an insult to intelligence, a defiance to logic, which it has none, and a massive waste of time. I would not watch it even if I get paid. If someone makes me watch it twice, I would call it a torture. Astonishingly awful movie given the amount of money the producer spent in producing it. I would give it 5 stars if it were only a B movie. It only deserves 1 or maybe 2 stars should the director consider it as an blockbuster.""Man oh man, what a bad movie. Lead actor was so bad and just not likable. He was so unlikable in fact, as I watched this, I was actually rooting for the bad guys. I wanted the bad guys to take this dude out so this movie could end and I could at least walk away from watching this with some kind of smile on my face. He played the part so wuss like, it made me cringe. Bad story, bad script, bad acting. Hopkins and Kingsley, what can I say. I love both these dudes but couldn't figure out what either one of them was thinking when they decided to be in this movie. It was a mercy killing for both of them. The story was so bad, all this movie did for me was give me a big crick in my neck from shaking my head so much. With both Hopkins and Kingsley in this I was hoping I would be seeing a decent movie. Nope, not happening, even their caliber of acting could not save this POS movie. Always hard for me to watch good actors in bad movies.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** To be honest , I was looking forward to seeing this one. A comedy about an idiotic boyfriend, there can be some comedic opportunities involved. But truthfully, all I got was a rehash of Meet the Parents. But unlike Meet the Parents, this isn't nearly as funny or wonderfully chaotic as that. If you've seen Meet the Parents, then you don't need to see Why Him. Bryan Cranston is the unbalanced, and indecision father (Robert Di Niro), James Franco is the unusual and awkward boyfriend who gets under the dad's skin one way or another (Ben Stiller). Then you got the useless family members who's roles are only meant to give the actors paychecks, nothing more. Yeah, see what I mean. And the problem it doesn't offer anything new, just familiar territories. The only positive I can say is that James Franco and Bryan Cranston prove they are still great actors and I hope to see them in more significant films in the future. Is this the comedy of the year? No. Is this funny. In awkward ways. Yeah, feel awkward the whole way through. Awkwardness isn't funny. There really isn't a demographic that I'd recommend this to, unfortunately. I was excited going in, but in the end, left feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. Now to grade. Acting: B- Comedy: C- Music: C Story: D+ Effects: C- Overall: C-""This movie is an exercise in how revolting they can go. But stupid scatological humor, and a plethora of f-bombs is one thing; when disgusting explicit sexual descriptions come out of the mouth of children, well I think this descends into the category of child pornography. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed.
I didn't expect this kind of movie from an actor like Bryan Cranston, or the director of ""I Love You Man"". There must be a grown-up somewhere in the process, you would think, to say no, this is beyond decency. I've seen a couple films from Jason Bateman, ""Bad Words"" and ""The Change-Up"", that both put children in sexual situations, which should be offensive to everyone. Studios need to feel repercussions from foisting this kind of sleazy contemptible depravity on unsuspecting audiences.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Before I start this review I'm telling you that I generally love Seth Rogan's sense of humour and all of the actors that were voicing the characters I love as well, but this movie made me cringe. The entire plot of the movie sounded great and watching the trailers definitely caught everyone's attention, and it's not that often that an adult animation comes out and gets that much hype. It had a really good unique idea. The voice acting and animations were done really well. That's about where the positivity ends.
The first time I tried to watch it with my boyfriend, and we shut it off after the ""rape scene"" with the douche and the juice box about 15 minutes or so into the movie. I mean, I can get how it can kind of be comical because I mean, it's a douche and a juice box, but just the fact that they were trying to compare it to rape was a bit screwed up and made me uncomfortable.
The second time I tried to watch it was with one of my friends who swore it was hilarious and we just had to watch it so I was forced to watch it and finish it. The entire time she was laughing at every stupid and lazy attempt they made at humour and I was sitting there straight-faced wishing it was over.
I have a pretty good sense of humour but the constant sexual jokes in this movie weren't even clever at all and they were pretty pathetic.. the kind of twelve year old boys make when they try to make everything sound sexual. I was happy when I thought movie had finally come to an end when suddenly all the food randomly started having this massive orgy which was another 5 minutes of pointless ridiculousness.
Honestly, this had a good idea but just turned out to be complete trash, and not the funny kind. It was just pathetic and sad that people wasted so much time and money to create it. If you have this certain sense of humour that finds absolutely everything funny, you'd probably laugh a few times. If you're like me where it takes more than some weak sexual innuendos and over-the-top deaths to make you laugh then please do yourself a favour and skip this one. Everyone I know that has seen this (except that one friend) hated it.""This movie should not even be considered B grade because it's much worse than that. Tommy Lee Jones is looking for a easy pay day and Jessica Alba has never been much of an actress, Jason Statham tries to deliver but falls flat as well.
The directing along with the poor and predictable script writing is utterly appalling. This combined with the standard of acting makes this movie almost unbearable.
Has to be the worst Statham movie ever!
I'm sure 90% of people who watched this film feel ripped off!
Cannot believe that this movie grossed more than 3 times its budget!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Bad acting, melodrama, weak plot, poor characterisation, pathetic script , boring music and the general senselessness that pervades the whole movie make it unwatchable.
Trying to cash in on the wave of neo(read pseudo) nationalism , Rustom fails miserably.
Akshay Kumar acts like a Robot from 70's sci-fi flicks. Esha Gupta looks like she she has been asked to model for Kingfisher Premium and dishes out ridiculously mismatched expressions throughout the movie.
Most of the supporting cast follows suit . In fact the overacting is nauseous.
To top it all is the nonsensical story. A pathetic mix of infidelity, patriotism, jingoism and gender relationships that reminds one of outlawed sensibilities .
The movie is so crass that at times one feels like laughing at the comic elements in the movie not because they are funny but because they are so stupid . It is almost unbelievable that a movie like this came out .
If I were to sum up the movie I would say it is a boring film with no saving grace . Please don't waste you time or money on this one.""Terrible film. It is one of those contrived set ups which quickly has you wondering whether you care what happens to anyone.
There are no likable, believable characters. The story line is so poor the whole film could have been played out in 10 minutes. The various characters were so plastic it is a wonder that they didn't melt in the desert sun.
The daughter, supposedly 17 years old, is so unreal and uninteresting, her father, Mel, would have been forgiven for letting her continue to do her own thing.
Why Mel Gibson was connected with this film whilst directing the fantastic Hacksaw Ridge is beyond me.
Best to wait until the DVD is in the charity shops if you really want to watch it sometime.
When I first saw the rating it was at 8.4 and I thought I was in for a good film.
Wrong. The rating really needs to be brought down to give viewers a more realistic level of expectation - i.e. low.""This was very disappointing containing no real insight nor any comedy. The characters never become more than stereotypes (not particularly likable stereotypes) and the whole confection seems little more than a puff piece to flatter the egos of the makers.
No-one is more than we expect them to be and no attempt is made to use the time-shifting to explore differences to art, morals or society. Despite the persistent talk on the theme of nostalgia there is no successful attempt to actually discuss this. Perhaps any attempts were unable to come to the surface under the weight of layers of cliché holding them down.
The only saving grace is the visual depiction of Paris and the high quality acting but form without content id essentially unsatisfying.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Hi folks.
Don't even bother with this one.
Possibly one of the worst films ever made.
Do not be fooled by the stylish cover artwork. What looks to be a great film is, in actuality, a far cry from it's potential.
The DOG is the most exciting and fearsome actor of this movie. And after it's appearance/role, the film just falls flat on it's back-side; after which I was tempted to turn the film off.
A great disappointment because the visual quality of the film was excellent. But the storyline and dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.
Might suit a young teenager audience with very limited knowledge or lack of insight into this films genre.
A complete waste of time and money.
Hope this helps . . .
Best.

I've never been so disappointed in my life for deciding to waste 90 minutes of my own life. The three stars are for the scenery and the seagull. Not even close to unrealistic. In fact, it's so far past it, it's like it's stuck on a buoy out to sea. Makes Jaws look like an incredibly great and realistic movie. There was one thing I guess I cared a little about in this movie, whether or not she survived. Problem was the movie was so bad that I really didn't want to know how she did/didn't survive, I just wanted to know the result. I beg of you to watch something else, anything.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie feels like a whole bunch of graduating film students, armed with their folders of ""film theory"", decided it would be a good idea to make a feature film out of a short film. Bad idea.
*this review may contain spoilers*
This is the first horror film I've seen that is depressing. Depressing! If I wanted to see a bleak, psychologically unhinged film with way too many metaphors, I would have picked something else. I read such great reviews all over the net I thought I would buy it and settle in for a night of scares. pfft! my grandmother is scarier than this film.
It feels like we come in halfway through the setup. A seriously annoying and badly behaved kid and a mother already strung out and at wit's end. It doesn't endear empathy - I spent the first half hour being annoyed AT the film for all the caterwauling and shrillness. I did not empathise with the characters. Don't blink or you'll miss the reason - a one line explanation of what happened six years ago. There was no recent catalyst that triggered off the forthcoming events, no explanation of why they would find the book at this time, it just... 'happened'.
Dreary, miserable, slow, predictable and overly symbolic with no relief. If you wanted to study this film in a course, it ticks all the boxes to endlessly psychoanalise the mind of the mother about whether it is real or some sort of delayed PTSD manifesting as the ""the monster in the closet"". I understand why they chose the set design to be washed out and shadowy but it didn't change with any action either - there was no high contrast in the scenes outside of the house as to inside the house. No sense of The real world vs the internal struggle. It was just all dull and draining to watch.
and the dog. really? gratuitous and unnecessary.
I was looking forward to this film but as an entertainingly good horror movie - I didn't expect I'd have to 'read' it.
The Babadook failed to impress on either a horror or macabre level.
Not even bad enough to be good.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Yes,awful! Pretentious attempt with the writing to appear sophisticated yet it was annoying within 15 minutes. The flash backs and music...ugh! The last 15 minutes just made me angry that I wasted my evening watching this because IMDb had a rating of 6.7. IMDb ratings are usually right on target but this must have been a scam of abusers submitting bogus stats.
If you watch this then review all the goofs to make sure they are accurate. I don't want to waste my time and even review it myself but there are a ton of them goofs especially with the locked doors....so easy to get out of the house in the end movie sucked!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I wanted to like this movie. I love the theme, I love the set up, the family feels real, and there is fun and interesting villain. But they committed the cardinal sin of horror movie making; they overused CGI. After the first scare or two with CGI, I thought, okay they can't keep doing this the whole time right? Horror is all about suspension of disbelief. Well it's pretty much impossible to believe anything in this movie is actually happening, or could happen, because every time a monster\creature comes on screen it looks a video game character blue screened into the shot. It was flat out obnoxious. And then when you finally get to see Krampus, which isn't until the climax, he has the worst CGI face I have ever seen. It was so bad that I didn't even realize until a month or two later that he was supposedly wearing a mask, which frankly is just as bad. like I said, this movie could have been wonderful, it was entertaining to point, but when the cinematography looks like 2015 and the CGI looks like 1991, the movie feels completely disjointed. And if you think that CGI can only go so far, just look back to what they did with the first Jurassic park, back in the early to mid 90's. If they can pull off dinosaurs 20 years ago, then can we please make a monster look even somewhat realistic; or better yet, just get rid of CGI and go back to practical effects. John Carpenters remake of the Thing had amazing effects that looked real and scary, and that was what 1981? Watch this movie while playing on you cell phone, you will be far more entertained that way""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The original Total Recall was grounded in the premise that traveling to other planets through your mind was more interesting, cheaper, safer, etc...
Well, this sorry remake trashes the original premise almost completely. The action is sorely limited to a souped up, over populated Earth, rather than Mars. The landscape of Mars is what contributed to the success of the original, but removing it in this outing also removes any chance of the film being entertaining,,,this one comes across as more of an attempt at bringing a video game to life, nothing more...
This is, without a doubt, the very worst remake I have ever seen...even worse than Starship Troopers, which I absolutely hated...""I watched this movie on the eve of the inauguration of the 45th President of the USA. It wasn't hard to connect the content of the movie, based on Alan Moore's dystopian series of graphic novels, with fears for the future. I guess that's a sign of the filmmakers' seriousness of intent.
Sure enough, V FOR VENDETTA gets off to a great start, full of action and mystery. As the story progresses, however, the excitement peters out, as it does in the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX trilogy does, bogged down in heavy-handed portentousness.
Natalie Portman works hard and effectively in the leading role of Evey Hammond, with Hugo Weaving doing his best to make a credible human being out of the eponymous man in a Guy Fawkes mask. A who's who of character actors, led by the perpetually pained Stephen Rae, toil away earnestly in support.
The film's fatal flaw is that it assumes the majority of people are liberal at heart, and will rise up to oppose right-wing oppression. We just have to take a look at what's happening as I write this. In both the USA and Europe, democracies are turning their backs on liberal values. The demagogues are winning. The moral is, don't rely on the movies for up-to-date political analysis.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First of all I have the greatest respect for the real soldiers that this film purports to represent. The training depicted during the introductory titles tests them to the limit and sometimes beyond. Throw them down a mountain though in the way that we see demonstrated in this film not once but twice, and they will break. Shoot them in the head and they will die. Stick bullet holes in them and they will pass out from shock or from blood loss. Fill their legs with huge chunks of shrapnel and they won't be able to walk. Somehow his film seems to have bypassed a reality check by many viewers, I can't think of any other reason it scores so highly. The action is brutal and intense, but also constructed in a way that should be absurdly unbelievable for most people over the age of 15. The characterisation makes Top Gun look like a work of Shakespeare and the gung-ho sacrifice of a Chinook full of soldiers forced on at gunpoint into the battle by one of their own ranks right up there with Major Kong riding the bomb in Dr Strangelove. Watch Come and See if you want to know what war is like, and watch Top Gun if you just want entertainment. The only people I'd recommend this one for is for sound-editors and mixers.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Movie is so boring and very unrealistic, people only gives good reviews because they think it's insulting or disrespectful to Paul Walker which it isn't. Movie is so unrealistic and boring, actors are so boring throughout the series and people think they are good actors only because of their looks. Like really? Driving one building to another? So unrealistic nobody wouldn't do that on real life unless they can land on the ground safely. I feel like I'm the only person in the universe who's smart enough to know how fake this movie is, people acts like they did all this in real life when they didn't. Also it's lame how their character won't die as if they are immortal which isn't possible in real life. It so easy to not die in movies it's like Call Of Duty where you can't die in campaign or else you're stuck in one mission and can't proceed.""When I saw the first divergent movie, I really liked it and I became really excited to see the adaptions of the next two books (insurgent and allegiant).But after I saw the 2nd movie, it was a lot different from the book and I started to get confused on why it wasn't going to be like how the first movie was. But after I saw this movie,I realized that it was nothing like what it was based on and it looked liked it was based on a video game.I became really disappointed on how the divergent series became a series I don't recognize anymore.If Divergent just became a TV show instead of a movie before the first movie came out, then it would have had a better chance at being more popular and talked a lot about. But that never happened.""This is a movie about bombs. Lots of bombs. Desert bombs.
The End.
That's pretty much it. Oh sure, a few other things happened. You wanna hear about 'em? OK. I'll provide you with a little more, oh faithful reader.
I'm still not sure what the title The Hurt Locker refers to. It's not about well-secured first aid kits, nor is it about gymnasium facilities for actors William, John, or even Mary Beth.
This celluloid endeavor was directed by Kathryn Bigelow; the deft hand behind such legendary screen classics as Point Break and Blue Steel. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, an expert at diffusing bombs. Joining him on the Explosivity Disposaling Unit are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Owen Eldrige (Brian Geraghty)
Renner was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. I'm not sure why this is. The supporting performances - most notably Mackie's - were, in my opinion, superior. All Renner did was act ""cool"". Oh, so ""cool"". Desert ""cool"". But if looking ""cool"" is the only criterion used for award recognition, then David Caruso should be nominated for a Nobel Prize.
The film centers mostly on the antics of Sergeant James. James loves dismantling things that can blow you into a zillion pieces. He'd rather do that than live a peaceful life in a nice home with his beautiful wife. We're shown some of his domestic life, but the movie doesn't show the good stuff. No. Instead we see him cleaning out the eaves trough of his house.
Now I've cleaned out a few roof gutters in my time, but the one depicted here has to be the gunkiest gutter in the history of home maintenance. And he's cleaning it out with his bare hand!!! C'mon, use a scoop, or a trowel, or a toy shovel, a stick, a shoe, anything. I'd rather diffuse bombs in Iraq than have to clean out that gutter in that fashion.
Another scene worth mentioning shows the guys - after getting a little snockered - engaging in an activity where good judgment and mental acuity would be a distinct disadvantage. The ""game"" involves taking turns hitting each other as hard as possible in the stomach. My wife, while watching this powerful and touching scene, turned to me and asked, ""Why do men do those kind of things?""
You know, we men just have to chuckle when women ask us such questions. It was obvious to me, but I patiently explained it to her that this was a gesture of endearment. Women hug. Men try to smash the bejabers out of each other. It's their way of saying, ""You're OK in my book."" And nothing says it better than a ruptured spleen.
A word of warning here to those prone to seasickness: the camera- work in this film is of that hand-held style that so many directors are wont to use these days. I suppose they feel it gives their movies that gritty, realistic, documentary look - which is ironic, since documentary filmmakers rarely use the technique anymore. Besides, if it's supposed to look realistic, then why don't I see the real world that way through my eyes? Although if I did, I'd be making an appointment - and pronto - with an ophthalmologist or a brain surgeon.
If you have a tough time watching this film due to that camera style, then avoid The Bourne Ultimatum at all costs. You would not survive. Its visuals are worse than any bone-jarring experience you could imagine
I once took a ride on a gigantically tall roller coaster. Its peak disappeared into the clouds. It was called the Red Ripper, or the Brown Streak, or the Green Puker - something like that. Anyway, all I know is that I was smiling after that ride. I wasn't smiling after The Bourne Ultimatum.
In closing, I should say that even though I had some reservations about renting the DVD of The Hurt Locker, I was able to take something positive from it - a lesson.
The lesson learned is, pay attention to your reservations.""Am I offended at the jokes in the movie? No, I often make equally horrible, if not, admittedly, worse jokes. Am I offended by the jabs at religion in this movie hidden in its horribly hidden attempts, or lack thereof, to create a thought-provoking story? No, I'm not particularly religious, and if I were, I would've appreciated a movie that was thought-provoking and made me question what I believe. What offends me is how the movie's premise promised a juxtaposition of thought-provoking commentary and funny adult humor, but I came to find that it completely and utterly fails in both regards.
Sausage Party tried so hard to be funny, with food puns relating to sex peppered throughout that would have been worth a chuckle if they were presented in literally any other manner. The execution was horrid, especially when you consider that the movie promised a fusion of raunchy comedy and profound commentary, but instead provided potentially somewhat-funny jokes ruined by being told akin to an 8 year old who forgot how the punchline was worded.
The supposed attempts at thought-provoking religious commentary reared its head maybe once or twice during 2 minutes total of watchable segments of this atrocity, but were pushed to the back- burner as means to make way for sex jokes and racial stereotypes for particular ethnic food that are not funny in the slightest because, disregarding how these stereotypes have been played to death in adult comedies, there's hardly any joke behind any of it besides ""Haha, look, the taco is Mexican. Funny, yeah?""
Absolutely not worth a watch. You'd be better off looking anywhere else for through provoking commentary and/or adult humor.""Finding Nemo 8/10 Finding Dory? The force awakens... reheated, rehashed, rescripted film that rips off the original with no charm, no reason to exist and has the original voices show up not for fun, integrity or art but for a fast pay cheque. Full stop.
It's compared to Finding Nemo and has some of the same cast and crew. However, this film is no Finding Nem. While it follows a similar structure to the prequel, the ""colour by numbers"" themes, songs and travel feel a bit tired. I enjoy the sea theme and feel they could have made this a great film, but they have made a OK film that is good for recent immigrants and refugees who did not see the original. This developmentally challenged character uses the ""ocean"" where Finding Nemo used the reef, sea, ocean and the world as a metaphor. The main song is boring, but not as boring as Frozen or Moana. The truck and fish out of water sequences are wholly unrealistic and very very lazy.""The story is pretty much lost in conviction and that is the biggest pitfall of the movie. Bollywood Directors, might think as is they might be breaking new ground through dialectics on love and friendship but they have been a constant theme in cinema of every generation and many times excellently done. And the exploration itself is pretty shallow, superfluous, lacking in vigor, heart or soul thus lost in conviction. Did I say that already! You get the drift.
Actors ""try"". Ranbir is best out of all. Surprisingly even Aishwarya beats Anushka in performance, who seems to be repeating same old loud characters over and over again. Fawad seems so 2 dimensional figure cut. Shahrukh did add a bit of charm.""I am very disappointed in Disney for this film. Here we have Disney's first Black/African American princess and she's poor, almost like a servant to a white blonde haired woman and she spends 96% of the movie as a frog! On top of that the movie is scary and dark, the songs aren't memorable (the music is an important part of Disney, I was just so upset that I couldn't remember one song after leaving the theater) and the characters and their drawls is just unsettling. If I recall correctly some were missing teeth and had the most obnoxious offensive accents that you could give a character in a movie about a black princess. The animation was not breathtaking as many of Disney's movies usually are. The animation was flat and dry.
Why couldn't the princess marry a black man? Most of all the Disney princesses have married/fell in love with someone of their race with the exception of Pocahontas which is historically based so it does not count. They could have made a beautiful princess and give her an interesting and intriguing background and setting. I can't stand that they went to New Orleans for this one, just why?
Disney should just erase Tiana, pretend like she never existed and start from scratch completely. This princess deserves better than that.""Couldn't wait for this movie to be over and had zero sympathy for these fools that put their lives at risk to climb a mountain. The Brolin character claimed that he was bored when at home but felt alive when climbing. Later admitted when on the mountain that he had eyesight problems. Real smart guy. Duh. Was the loss of his hands and nose worth it? Think of the self created anguish through which they put their families. Like skiers, who venture into dangerous territory after being warned of an avalanche risk, relatives ask the authorities to put others at risk to save these macho idiots.
I'm reminded of a movie that I saw years ago about two Austrians attempting to scale the north face of the Matterhorn. Near the end of the movie one of them was hanging helplessly from a rope shouting that he didn't want to die (which he did). Thought about that a little late didn't he! Totally boring.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This review originally appeared in the Korea Herald, in 1978 under the headline STAR WARS comes to Korea.
""Star Wars"", I am sad to say, is such a piece of dreck that it is hardly worth talking about, but since it's my job to discuss films of all types I will add a few words to the mounds of hyperbole that have preceded its arrival. Three words say it all; mindless mental masturbation -- from beginning to end with a plot and devices geared to the mind of a pre-school child this all-time turkey has no redeeming features whatsoever -- unless things like dueling with neon tubes can be deemed redeeming. The most interesting scene in the movie takes place in a barroom with ugly spacelings of every ilk including a shaggy reject from Planet of the Apes, slobbering in their Makkoli (cheap Korean joy juice similar to pulque) -- but even this scene is interesting only for its grotesqueness. The much-vaunted special effects, the klunky space vehicles and the robots who ride them, are literally ridiculous. The Korean audience I watched it with applauded politely at the end when the main goodie finally got the main baddie, but it had neither the spontaneity nor the zest of the earlier applause at ""Jaws"". (I saw both the same day). It is hard to account for the phenomenal international success of this film and I will refrain from theorizing on this subject beyond observing that far more people go for McDonald's hamburgers than for chateaubriand. What is strange here is that so many people are willing to pay the box office equivalent of chateaubriand prices for the movie equivalent of McDonald's leftovers.

Bottom Line:Mindless Mental Masturbation with no redeeming features. For arrested minds only.""So the movie for 99% percent of it is a boring dumb predictable snore fest. The premise and story and payoff is decent, but the reason why you're seeing so many negative reactions is because the scientists, all of them are just incredible stupid and shallow. It's a ton of ""there's a shark in the water lets go swimming!"" scenes. Its not just a couple like Prometheus that ruin an otherwise exciting premise. Its over and over and over again. The worst possible example is a scene that goes on forever of this ""pompous arrogant doctor""(the one note cliché could have been written by a new born) arguing with the doctors that he ""Needs"" to be face to face with Morgan instead of behind glass to properly evaluate if she should be put down post rampage, despite being warned over and over that SHE IS A WEAPON THAT JUST TRIED TO KILL SOMEONE.
You know how you're in a theater and you'll hear some moron yell at the screen ""OMG Don't GO IN THERE""?
Thatll be you, constantly, every 5 minutes, through the entire movie.
Seriously just avoid this one.""Bollywood women are either: a. touchy-feely damsels (way older than college-going years, but shown as attending college anyways) who need to be wooed into loving, and once smitten, dance their pounds off with their rhythmic bosom and hip heaves - or b. ""modern"" gals who apparently have no qualms with being sexually promiscuous
Now that Bollywood has emerged from the apparent deep, dark pit of women being nothing more than a showcase adornment for the heroes in the film, they've gone all-out to find themselves on the other end of the ""no-holds-barred"" spectrum. It's a quantum leap, Bollywood-style. Needless to say, most women protagonists in this film are of the latter variety.
For once, would be nice if the makers decided to center the film around someone whose normalcy doesn't stretch the limits of imagination, someone who actually manages to cultivate a respectful relationship without simultaneously gulping down alcoholic shots and casually tossing themselves from one guy to the next.""Honestly, I cannot remember a slower movie that I have seen. The plot never really went anywhere, and the little suspense could not be maintained. I tried to give the movie a chance, and waited... Quinton T has lost his touch. This movie sets us back as a nation, relying on swearing, blood and talk of sexual rape to ""spice"" up the movie. Even a good cast could not save it. The oddball characters were a bit interesting, but could not carry the movie. The snow and cabin backdrop was interesting and clever . However never went anywhere. I thought it would never end. This is a good movie to watch if you are tired and want to fall asleep. I so miss the days of a good Hitchcock movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It's a truism to say: 'Never let the facts spoil a good story' - but to ignore facts completely is to write fantasy, not fiction - this film is fantasy.
And the best actor was the horse - should have been given an Oscar . . . .
It started out well - just the first 10 minutes - but after that the story showed little recognition of reality in any form. It is a shallow fairy tale - not even one with any clear moral worthy of nearly two hours of moralising.
Early on, there was mention of 'The Imperial Yeomanry'- potentially a great 'seed' for the following story, but utterly wasted - and even at the end of the film its relevance remained undiscovered. The vagueness seems to suggest that either the author or screenwriter were rather out of their depth regarding the Second Boer War and just flailing around at a deeper story. All we had as a thread was some barely seen pennant which miraculously stayed with the horse through the unfolding story, but which carried no weight in it. So much more could have been made of that angle.
Situations were created simply in order to be resolved in a emotionally jerky way, but also to reinforce stereotypes and received wisdom about WW1.
The British Cavalry charge is a nonsense - no army camp is defended by a row of machine guns behind them. Anyway, since the Boer Wars the British Cavalry was principally used for scouting and mobile skirmishing (mounted infantry) and used rifles - sword wielding cavalry charges was retained just for later gullible film directors.
However, if you are gonna have B. Cumberbatch in the film you have to give him something grand and patently foolhardy to do.
The Germans hardly ever shot deserters in the field in WW1: that was something that the British occasionally did but which usually involved a 'proper' Court Martial on both sides. In contrast, a horse, injured and trapped in No-Man's Land would more likely have been peremptorily shot.
Towards the end of the film, 'Grandpere' buys the ""miracle horse"" - it being the same one his grand-daughter briefly ""owned"". Quite how he found out about it 40 minutes later in the film involves a big leap of faith - or willful blindness - by the audience . . . .
The true stories about war horses are much more engaging - and sobering.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is bad to the point where there are no redeeming qualities about it.
First, the movie idea featuring bored over privileged and pretentious college kids wanting to trip on magic mushrooms is a little interesting. Also, let's throw in their host. Some English sheep shagger who happens to be the world's leading expert on psychedelic mushrooms. His first warning to everyone was not to eat the shrooms with the black eye in the middle because it could kill you. If it doesn't kill you, it could open a dimensional gateway to a nightmarish world.
Second, all those things combined could have an interesting movie. However, the movie's execution of the above theme was dreadful!
Third, as the movie digresses, the lines between reality and bad tripping become blurred. You can't tell what's really going on.
Fourth, as this non cohesive mess of a movie begins to unravel, the body count rises.
Fifth, I'm not sure what role or value added the back woods, inbreed, half wits provided for the movie?
Sixth, it appears Tara (Linsey Haun), the main character, went from being chased by hooded demons to the one doing all the killing? The movie does nothing to show that transition.
This movie was a mess. Perhaps the makers and everyone involved were on shrooms during the filming.""I MUST have watched the wrong movie. The reviews for this film could in no way apply to the contrived claptrap I've just seen. Perhaps the positive reviews here were intended for that 1974 masterpiece House of Whipcord.
The movie called Whiplash that I saw stars J.K. Simmons as Terence, a music teacher who can slap a face with such force as to make General Patton wince. The film also stars Miles Teller as Andrew, a student of Terence's who yearns to learn from him how to properly play the drums. Andrew accomplishes this by volunteering to let his teacher play the bongos on his face.
I won't say that Damien Chazelle's direction is heavy-handed, but I would probably prefer to stick my head in Andrew's bass drum during the climactic scene than to endure watching said scene again.
A word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film; go to YouTube instead and do a search for Buddy Rich. You will see the greatest drummer ever, and spare yourself the agony of viewing this over-the-top, trite, clichéd, eye-roll inducing effort. Your eyes and your ears will thank you for it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If you ask me if I would recommend this movie to you, I hope no... If all you need is entertainment, well, go and watch this.
But if you read the book first, you will be deceived as I was while watching. The story takes us out of the book context. At the beginning, I was expecting the movie to be very exciting and original. What a disappointment when I can see everything's being original in the book become the most hypothetical Hollywood script...
Not that I felt the movie story to be 100% in accordance with the book, but I was expecting some details to be set aside like Harry Potter movies, you know... What you will sadly see if you watch this is a forgotten amazing book story transformed in a big budget movie of poor content.
Bruno""*** This review may contain spoilers *** So, I finally did it. I bit the bullet and watched Suicide Squad--the Extended Cut. And...it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. That doesn't mean it wasn't still terrible, but it was a hell of a lot better than Batman v Superman. In fact, if it wasn't set in the world of Batman v Superman, it might almost be an enjoyable movie. Here's my review.
Grade: 6.5/10, C-
Story: 5/10 First of all, there was a good story in this movie beneath the morass of mediocrity. You could see glimpses and glimmers of greatness that just completely went away whenever any of the characters opened their mouths to speak. The villain was probably the worst part of this movie, though, and without a good villain, you just don't have good heroes--even anti-heroes. And that was the other problem--they kept calling the Suicide Squad villains, yet they were more misguided than anything. No one was truly evil, even the main villain, who...*shakes his head* I just...I just...I have no clue what they were trying to do with her. I really don't. A magical being who was trying to use technology to destroy the world. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and it makes even less sense as you're watching the movie.
Character Development: 5/10 Again, you could see glimpses of greatness in the characters that just vanished the second they spoke. Deadshot and Harley Quinn were the two they concentrated on the most, but they really had no life or charm to them. You could see glimpses of life and charm, but it vanished as quickly as you saw it. Amanda Waller was...sorta okay I guess, but there were about twelve times when I had to ask myself why Deadshot didn't just kill her. I mean, was one of the military guys going to go over, pick up the device to blow their heads off, and press it himself? I don't think so because everyone hated Waller! Especially her subordinates! And Diablo was supposed to have this tragic story, but his story did not make sense because you assumed he burned his family alive, yet when he was holding his wife, she was perfectly fine--not a hair singed on her head--until she just turned to ash and vanished. I was like...what? And let's not forget the Joker--the worst interpretation of the Joker I've ever seen in my life. Enough said. I hope the rumors that Jared Leto won't return to the DCEU are true.
Direction: 6/10 David Ayer almost had a good movie here. Almost. Another six rewrites, and he might have had a good movie, but he didn't. He had two-thirds of a good movie, which is surprising to me. But that one-third really, really, REALLY hurt this movie badly. The story wasn't told well by him, with far too much exposition and repeated exposition that just could have been handled better. And a lot of things in the movie happened JUST BECAUSE. I hate movies that demand a leap in logic from you because leaps in logic usually ended with a splat at the bottom.
Casting: 5/10 Casting in this movie was decent and terrible. Joker, terrible. Will Smith, decent. Margot Robbie, decent. Jai Courtney, good. Everyone else...eh.
Acting: 5/10 The acting was probably better than I'm giving it, but the actors did annoy me a tiny bit. Margot Robbie's accent kept slipping in an out. Will Smith was not Deadshot--he was Will Smith. Jared Leto was absolutely atrocious at the Joker, and I want to hurt the people who cast him as the Joker and decided to portray the Joker that way. He was not the Joker. He was someone trying to be the Joker but failing miserably. The guy playing Rick Flag was...kind of atrocious but...that could have just been his characters? I'm not sure. And the actress who played June Moon/Enchantress needs to never work in Hollywood again--ever.
Cinematography: 9/10 The movie looked good, other than the floating rocks in the sky, which we really don't need to see any more of, and the horrible way the Enchantress looked and moved. The bellydancing was really, truly not needed.
Music: 7/10 I really don't know how to score the music, because the songs used in the movie were great, they were just used poorly. You could see they were going for a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe, but GotG used its music so much better. The regular background music was good, though.
Pacing: 10/10 The movie didn't drag like I was expecting it to. Good job there!
Sets and Costumes: 7/10 I'm taking points off for the massive amounts of tattoos the Joker and Harley had. I hate tattoos to begin with, but the amount covering their bodies was almost obscene. And we know the Joker is damaged--did he had to have it tattooed across his forehead? Harley's costume wasn't as cute as she wanted it to be, either. Deadshot's was fine. Everyone else's was...eh.
Enjoyment: 6/10 My enjoyment of the movie was a lot higher than I was expecting, but not high enough that I'd ever bother watching this movie again. Another entry in the DCEU that should never have been made-- or at least made better than it was. It was still better than Batman v Superman, though. God, I still have nightmares about that monstrosity of a movie.""What a waste of my time. Poor acting really by the main lead character just killed the film for me. Slower pace than I expected at the first third of the film .
Just because its an ""indie"" film does not make it good. Hopkins and Kinglsey were cameo roles going the way of Nicolas Cage and other ""has been"" actors just for another film in their resume.
There's a lot of films competing for my time and money, unfortunately this one was a let down. Surprisedat how much this cost to make, but I guess the big guys needed their cut and the action scenes cost more in Europe to film. I guess this film wasn't for me.""As a real supporter and lover of the original Harry Potter films, I was more than excited to finally watch Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, but was severely disappointed. The movie lacked a clear plot until the final climax scene, which seemed to come out of nowhere, the dialogue was clumsy and stiff, and Eddie Redmayne, a normally incredibly gifted and talented actor, seemed strange and uncomfortable in his lead role, and was very hard to like, as he established strange and awkward relationships with the movie's supporting characters. Not only did the writers/director fail to relate Redmayne's character, Newt, to other, more relatable and likable characters, but they also did a lazy job of relating his character to the magical creatures he cared for, which might have saved the day. Overall, the film just seemed sloppy and not well planned, and I am very sad to say that I wouldn't recommend this one.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** *WARNING - this review contains spoilers*
This 'movie' is in fact nothing but blatant homosexual propaganda with a pseudo 'story' written around it.
Unfortunately there is no better way to phrase this. It starts with a dialogue promoting homosexuality and even ends with homosexual propaganda,but unfortunately it just doesn't stop with it throughout the 'movie'.
The thug is secretly gay, josh peck whispering in his friend's ear while groping his ass:'don't be homophobic' and so many more instances where you get the impression that the sole purpose of this 'movie' is to propagate the homosexual agenda instead of even trying to tell a story.
It's quite sad to what low level modern propaganda has fallen, at least try to brainwash people in a more subtle manner please.
The acting was borderline acceptable.""I won't repeat the plot, or lack thereof. Galifianakis seems to be going for Hollywood emaciated to the point his head now looks too big for his body. This movie is approaching the Jerry Lewis school of over-the-top stupid slapstick that only the French could love. I really really wanted someone - anyone - to shoot Galifianakis, his character was so unrealistically clueless. He plays a Human Resources manager who violates every rule of HR confidentiality and had to do a double-take in nearly every scene... so those of us texting and looking up occasionally would know it was supposed to be funny. Aarrgghhh. Nothing new in the plot, recycled dialog, predictable ending. Just keep texting. I gave it a 4 for the rare skit that worked, and the fact that it was smart enough to never go over 15 seconds without action.""If the first tragedy of a Jack Reacher movie wasn't enough, they made this one. If you don't factor in that Tom (joke of an actor) Cruise doesn't even remotely resemble how Jack Reacher is described in the novels, quite simply the butchering of the story should tell you what a horrible mistake this movie is. The only thing that even tells you it was based on a great book was the names of the characters and the base story. If you read the book and are a fan DO NOT watch this movie. It will make you sad. My prejudice aside against the hack of an actor Cruise, the way the twist the book to hardly resemble it at all is just bad form. I am disappointed in Lee Child for letting this happen. I had to give it a chance since I love the books, but at this point I might have to give the books up just because. If seems all Lee cares about is the money now. I think he used to love writing but I guess greed wins over in the end. Because as and I can't state this enough this WAS NOT A JACK REACHER movie.""I know what Wahlberg said about making the best version of a movie that was going to be made no matter what, but it's a shame. There's no reason for Hollywood to make up this story when the truth is even better. If you want to know what happened here in Boston, watch a documentary -- a few good ones have been made already. For that reason, what the movie gets right is its use of real film footage of the people and events. The real people speaking in short interviews at the end of the credits was very moving. Showing the photos of the people who died still made me start bawling. We took this bombing very personally. It may not play as emotionally in the rest of the country. What I hated about the film is Wahlberg's insistence on being the ""star"" in so many scenes (he wasn't needed, or remotely factual); how all the officials swore at each other or spoke gung-ho crap (""welcome to Watertown, motherfu**ers!"" yells a cop at the bombers); how the FBI agent was made to look like the bad guy when he was a hero. Just not necessary. Not a wonder so many victims chose not to participate. And whatever you do, please don't listen to any liars who insist this bombing didn't happen or was an inside job. America needs to wise up, alright. Ignorance hurts. Read a good book or watch a documentary about this story. It was definitely an example here of how good ALWAYS conquers evil. Love always wins.""Was this movie like plan A? Was this someone's best idea? This movie which shall hence forth be renamed Goo-sh*t, is not very good. Some of the reasons why Goo-sh*t is crap are as follows- Mad Hatter sucks, his character was poorly conceived of by the screenwriter then made worse by Tim Burton's direction. The movie cannot function without CGI, like plot and actors come second to the visual ejaculate of computer generated cartoons. Did you hear the words the actors said in the movie? Holy sh*t! Dialog, they call it, should be important in any play or movie, but here in Goo-sh*t, dialog since it isn't in 3-D, is an afterthought, and each word each character utters through-out this movie clangs with jarring mediocrity. You and I, we are better than this, we deserve better, let's you and I make us a REAL movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Here In Egypt movies get released after it's official release in USA I was supposed to see why him but i changed my mind to see this i was super excited to this thing,now i know that screenplay are written Microsoft word,this movie its screenplay is written in Microsoft excel its events is edited and arranged in a perfect way if an army leader who did it he won't arranged it in that way,i liked the acting of will smith and Kate Winslet and keira knightley,but not Edward Norton he was so so so cold in his acting so as others but Helene mirren was 50/50 in her acting,it was carrying an complicated philosophical plot that they would have used it to make an great worthy plot but they used cheap things in a plot like will smith's daughter death and the trailer was a big liar' i don't know why actors in this movie agreed to act in it and it didn't have the Christmas spirit collateral beauty carries a philosophical plot presented in a very very wrong way with so questions left from the screenplay and illogical things but it's a guilty pleasure for me and I'll give it 3.5/10""There are moments when you watch a trailer for a movie and think to yourself ""Well, the trailer is pretty bad, but maybe the movie is better."" And, sometimes the movie does actually turn out to be better, making you pleasantly surprised. I did not have that feeling as I watched the trailer for the Bye Bye Man. After the trailer ended, there was not one ounce of me that thought ""OK, maybe I should give it a shot."".
I watched this movie with my best friend, who also happens to be a horror fan, only because we have literally seen everything else that was out. I personally found three major issues with the movie.
1. The characters: Not one of the characters were particularly likable, so who really cares if any or all of them get hacked to bits? They don't really have any back story. The only one you feel any emotion towards at all is Elliot, and even those moments of emotion are sparse. Of course, he's the only one who has somewhat of a history to him.
2. The acting: To put it simply, the acting is horrendous. It's downright laughable. The writing can only be blamed for so long. It felt more like a high school stage production (and a bad one at that), than an actual movie. The women who played Kim, and Elliot's girlfriend, are by far the worst out of the whole movie, the latter being slightly worse than the former.
3. The worst thing about this movie is there is no mythology about the Bye Bye Man. There is zero backstory into who or what this creature is. All we know is that he is a creepy man with a creepy dog, and that's it. We don't know why he's terrorizing and killing these people, other than the fact that they say his name. WHY?! Where did that lore come from? Even the most psychotic icons of horror have some backstory into why they are that way. This movie offers you none of that.
I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie; I wouldn't recommend renting this movie; I wouldn't even recommend watching this movie for free on Netflix. This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and I've seen some very bad horror movies."*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is some feminists garbage. Every woman is presented to be a victim as we find the common denominator to all their problems. Some squirrel trying to get a nut. Hollywood has a sickness that cannot be cured. They continue to pass off a great American pastime as a brainwashing session. Emily Blount did a great job acting the part. That girl has refined her skills. The writer did an adequate job of developing the main characters. The movie was a typical look into a different demographic and lifestyle that makes you want to keep your distance from such characters. It is Hollywood so things are exaggerated but their is an annoyance of entitlement and waste. The movie could have been fulfilling if the zealots could have toned down the passive aggressive feminist heroines."Jeremy Irons is a very good actor. But he has to eat, pay the rent and probably he has other expenses too. Similarly, I think, Marion Cotillard. Therefore, they accept to play even in productions like this. Charlotte Rampling was smooth and beautiful when she was very young(who remember her in ""Sequestro di persona""(1968) directed by Gianfranco Mingozzi or ""The Night Porter/Il portiere di notte""(original title)(1974), directed by Liliana Cavani?). From many years now, she is the perfect ugly and nasty bitch. Michael Fassbender does nothing more than repeat the painful experience of ""X-Men: Apocalypse"", the role of Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Cal Lynch/Aguilar is a perfect role for the younger generation of morons that inhabit the world wide. The film is a total waste of time for those with basic concepts about talent, quality, artistic sense and common sense in general. I felt offended watching it. 15,000 people worked for nothing in this film, resulting in a big poop.""First, even though I do like Manu Bennett from his days on Spartacus and Arrow, I don't usually see a movie or TV show because of whose in it. Seeing that Roger Corman was behind this (the last two remakes/reboots were OK, but just OK), I figured I'd give this a shot. Having watched it I can see why it never got any large release. Absolute trash. Not even the fun kind of trash, but just poor, badly written, directed and acted Trash. I'm sure everyone who was in this mess did it only for the paycheck. Roger certainly isn't the Roger of the old days, not if this is the best he can do. Sitting through this was like getting one's teeth pulled without Novocaine. Avoid this at all costs. Just a waste of cinema.""I'm perplexed by the glowing reviews for ""Fantastic Beasts,"" as it seems to lack any of the wonder or warmth of the best of the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The titular beasts are not-so-fantastic, rather appearing as very garish, cartoonish CGI creations - instantly pulling us out of the film and its new world-building. Every set piece is just constructed with endless green screen and lazy computer effects. There's nothing exhilarating or awe-inspiring on display here - just one video game cut scene after another. (And I'm a video game fan, so I'm not belittling them; but the point is that as a movie with such an emphasis on visuals, there's nothing here that you haven't seen done much better, including on home gaming consoles.)
Eddie Redmayne, one of the most overracted actors alive, is woefully miscast as Newt. He takes scenery-chewing to Nic Cage levels, minus the fun. Every facial expression, every little tic, is so overly calculated and overly accentuated that it begins to evoke memories of Simple Jack from ""Tropic Thunder.""
Colin Farrell is stuck in another supporting role that doesn't play to his strengths, completely forgettable and generic. Ezra Miller seems to be in competition with Redmayne to see who can chew the most scenery - the kid is just awful. There's a not-so-secret cameo appearance that was announced before the movie hit theaters (ostensibly to counteract any potential fallout due to the actor's recent personal issues and allegations of doemstic abuse) - and this actor, who was once so talented, manages to ham it up even with just two pieces of dialogue, and leaves very little hope that he will be a menacing or charismatic villain in the (god help us) sequels to this movie.
There are numerous supporting actors who seem tonally and aesthetically wrong for the 1920s setting - the whole crew of wizards, for example, look like a bunch of Abercrombie models playing Prohibition dress-up. You know how the undercut haircuts are all the rage right now, loosely based on haircuts from that era but upgraded with the skin fading, etc. that barbers back then did not have the means to do? Well, that's pretty much how everyone looks in this movie. Even Colin Farrell is rocking a hipster undercut that just distracts.
Katherine Waterston is awesome. She looks the part, she puts Redmayne to shame as an actor, and she inspires a lot of faith for her role in ""Alien: Covenant."" She is the lone saving grace of this film.
It's a shame about the rest of the performances and the glaringly poor CGI special effects, because honestly, the other attention to detail paid to the city and its era is pretty impressive - there are lone shots in the movie, the ones mostly devoid of the miserable SF/X, that are quite impressive and lovely to look at. The costumes for average city folk (less so the wizards...) are lovingly fashioned. There are hints here of what a great film this might have been in the hands of a better director, someone who didn't make a film as bad as ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" with a cast of actors who mostly aren't hamming it up and totally misfiring on every level.
Maybe the sequel will rectify these issues.""Insulting word in title, but an even more insulting for potential viewer! Watched 15 minutes,15 to many and the DVD box should say not for children or anyone else. This film would make a nice interrogation device forcing your capture to cave in and tell you every bit of Intel the prisoner knows about the forces their own side! If you can watch the entire stink bomb burn after watching. If you are like me destroy the DVD after five minutes viewing. Have never been a fan of Quinton Tarintino's spaghetti war comedy movies and after 5 minutes of watching I have even less respect for the director. Certainly not to be acclaimed for any award, but worth target shooting""I very much wish that I could give this movie a zero, or a negative number. The talents of these enormously talented actors - Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon, Randy Quaid, Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd were enormously wasted in this film that took away 98 minutes of my precious life. Were the writers, producers and the director of this tragedy on some kind of hallucinogenic drugs, or were they just so lacking in talent that they could not produce a much, much, much better sequel than this disaster??? I feel like I totally deserve to receive every penny of the money that I wasted going to see this bad, really bad flop of a film. I expected a much better film than this monstrosity. There is some debate as to which movie made, throughout the history of film is the worst. Well, this ""film"" puts an end to the debate. It is the worst movie of them all. It was not even slightly funny. In fact, nothing in the movie made me smile, let alone laugh. I will never understand why in the world the big talents I mentioned earlier didn't merely walk away from this movie after reading the script. Even the gopher was UN-funny. It was just another annoyance in this totally rotten tomato of a film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I want to say things about how the movie fails as a movie. And not whether it depicts the society correctly or not. First and most clear thing which gets noted is that the protagonist was forming a Rule Book on Women Safety. It appears that the main aim of the movie was to make Hittchicker's Guide for the Women Safety in Indian Society. The protagonist says his thoughts out loud amid the court sessions while everybody listens to him as if it is relevant to the case. It is totally irrelevant to the case and waste time of the court. This should have been shown as a side thought in the protagonists mind. There are some other blunders. At the end of first court session, there are no arguments against the antagonist and protagonist's client is proved guilty. The decision should have come then and there. But no there were other sessions as well. Then in one proceeding, protagonist objects the antagonist for filling in the details of his clients statement while questioning. And it was right thing to do. But later, when protagonist questions his client, he completes the story of which his client has told only a small part. Not only that, he also tells few rule for his safety manual. C'mon, this is unaccounted authority given to the protagonist. In most Bollywood movies, the same is true. Finally, when there is no hope left for protagonist to win, accuser/antagonist's client(accuser as he filed the case) confesses. There is no pressure on him. He gets angry on seeing a photo of his sister doing nothing. He starts talking badly. And finally confesses that she(accused) deserved it what happened to her. This ending could have been really made better. It seems like there was lack of content and/or running time left with the producers/directors. They were in a hurry to finish the movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The trailer used to promise a lot but then when it came out the reviews suggested that this film hasn't quite set the world on fire, so I was watching it with zero expectations but looking for some laughs. If you think about the idea itself, the fact that foods, drinks etc. have lives, they talk, see etc. and are like humans or animals, one can't resist being fascinated by it, but the application left a lot to desire.
The first 20-25 minutes were a total headache really, with every phrase filled with the F-word three -four times - it was beginning to drive me mad but then once they get out of the market the film gets better and finally funny. The Arabic Sheikh style lavash was the funniest character, as was the physically disabled chewing-gum on the motorised wheelchair. Some jokes were really funny during that particular phase of it.
BUT!
Then the film-maker seemed to end the film in a fashion that made it resemble to a drawing by a child who does his job neatly but then draws random lines on the paper to ruin his work just because he has set his eyes on the toy lying next to him. That war between them and the humans was plain needless, but the porn film-like ending takes the cake! It was just disgusting and garbage. Really hated it!
As a footnote, it didn't sound pleasant to the ear them abusing ""gods"". They should've simply shown humans as humans, opposed to gods. It felt awful to the ears.
Overall, in short, a creative idea ruined by poor application. It had its occasional funny moments though.""I note that many reviewers seem to take the stance that anyone who does not ""get"" this ""arty"" movie, are dumb and unrefined. I don't think that's the case at all I think the reason some love it and some hate it is simply that we all like different things. What I want from a movie is a story, I don't need a particularly fabulous story, and I don't need to understand the characters in depth all the time. But I do need a story.
When stories are told in books they leave an awful lot to the reader to make up. The environment may be described but it is up to the reader to fill n the blanks themselves. The characters maybe defined precisely in some ways, but the reader will always attribute their own ideas onto the character nonetheless. This is what makes good storytelling, so the story is unique to each person.
With movies it's not that simple. What you get is what you're given and there's little scope for idealizing things or trying to re-imagine them. It's within these constraints that a film maker has to work so if they veer from that and present a film such as this one, it leaves you to basically make up your own mind about what's going on.
I think that's skillful when a film maker can do that, a la Mulholland Drive, but when it fails it fails badly and I think this one fails. There's a lot of dead scenes where the images in front of you have no meaning: random shots of walls and shops, random views that are disconnected from the story, and lots of close ups which reveal nothing except Ms Johansson's lipstick.
I think very clever films like Mulholland Drive work because there is underneath it all a motive and story that the film maker wants to get across. In the case of this movie, I don't think there is a base motive or a story. I believe there was a rough idea and then a long set of unconnected and random scenes were developed in the hope that some might see it as art, or clever. In my opinion it is neither.
I also believe Scarlett Johansson was a very bad choice for this. She's not an accomplished actress, and not only did she not make me believe her place in the story, she lent absolutely nothing to it. No wonder it made a massive financial loss, it's just a very poor film.""I thought Space was unlimited but those aliens keep worrying Ripley! Honestly, reaching the 3rd round of such a fight, there is nothing new to enjoy, no more to say and it's just squeezing the money pulp to the last drop! It's a bit like making a movie about someone who breaks a leg: do you really believe in an 3rd exact accident in a row? This is exactly the big nonsense this movie tries to make us believe! So we got exactly the same ingredients than the other movies (as usual, the alien munches all of them, one by one) and if it would not be enough, the added ingredients are awful: the special effects are pretty bad, the idea of monks-prisoners who are free but in captivity is stupid and full of contradictions! The plot is poorly told as the DVD screens are much explicit and clear than the edited movie! And finally, I'm just very tired of those female heroes who kills, punches, shoots like soldiers! I'm even more tired of that rusty, decaying, bleak future and all those big climax finale in factories (T2, Freddy, LW, etc).""This film was extremely BORING. I expect to be entertained when watching a movie but this bored me to tears, nothing interesting happens at all. A waste of time. I didn't know until reading other reviews today that it was from the same writer as Forrest Gump, Forrest Gump I taught was a good entertaining movie and that's probably why this got made and why some people think it is good, they are caught up in the hype of Forrest Gump but this is just a boring, dull, unlikable movie. Its message is enjoy life and life is precious ya ya ya,, like we didn't know that already, we don't need to be told and we don't need to be bored to tears.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have a confession to make: I don't consider Jump scares to be real horror. Real horror should be something that makes you think....something you analyze late at night...and then realize the true meaning....and you are then kept awake the whole night by your realization. Or you could just have a scary face go ""BLAH!"" at the screen Presenting: The Forest Now, Aokighara Forest is a really scary place with a lot of opportunities, for scares...but they just go and waste it all. It's impossible to get invested in our main character because she's completely bland, and as a result we can't give a crap about her quest. Everyone else? Just as bland if not blander than our main. Only watch if you are DESPERATE for something scary...and even then something like ""The Amityville Horror"" could probably suit your needs more.""Back in the 90's, when the internet was still new to people, there was a 'fun' craze that people would send others via email. You'd open the attachment and be told to have your volume up high while starring at a serene picture. Then out of nowhere a spooky face when pop up on the screen with a loud scream. It would freak people out, a classic jump scare. This is all The Forest is, cheap jump scares.
I'm surprised at how well this horror film was received with the critics because I found it to be lacking. The premise is good enough for a spooky horror film, but The Forest never bothers to use the setting it thrusts itself in to genuine scary effect. It's sad actually, that the film fails on these levels because I can only thing, 'what could have been'.
Sara discovers that her twin sister Jess has disappeared in Japan. She was last seen heading into Aokigahara, known as the Suicide Forest. Believing her to still be alive, Sara heads to Japan and into the woods with a guide to find her.
Natalie Dormer, of Game of Thrones fame, headlines this horror flick and plays double duty as the twins. The role doesn't ask much of her, just to be scared when needed and yell her sisters name a bunch of times. Taylor Kinney ventures into the forest with her. He's a journalist that hopes to cover the story. Are things what they seem with him? Who knows, the film doesn't really bother to answer these questions.
The horror elements don't really come into effect until late in the film, by then I felt bored by the tepidness of everything. The film takes place in a spooky forest for crying out loud, but it never takes advantage of this. It's the perfect atmosphere that a better director could creatively use to his/her advantage. This is why The Forest is such a disappointment, even by horror standards. It's just not scary.
Were told not to believe what we see in the forest, I can't believe I watched this.""When a little girl from a Boston neighborhood is abducted, the child's aunt hires a local couple to ask questions of the neighborhood residents, who may know something about the child's disappearance but won't talk to the cops. Adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel, co-written by Aaron Stockard and Ben Affleck, who also directed, is a bleak whirlpool of low-life characters, drug dealers, drug addicts and gangs. Some of the violence hits hard, yet Affleck cannot seem to stage his major sequences (to say nothing of his smaller moments) without artifice, and no one comes out of the picture looking good (you know there's a problem when even Morgan Freeman, portraying the suspicious police captain, fails to register). In the central role of the streetwise young man whose life is irrevocably changed by the kidnapping, Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) is an uninteresting screen presence, matching his garbled line readings (for 'realism') with open-mouthed reactions and shifting, faraway stares. *1/2 from ****""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Victoria is somewhat sad. The movie itself is a good indie flick. Its very unique with its single-shot and real-time setting. Its starts out a little slow, but really builds up suspense. Its a bit lo-fi, but by design. The actors are also great, scenery in the club and the garage is amazing. But ... the plot.
I am not talking about a weak story or plot holes. The main plot is that four guys rob a bank without any preparation whatsoever and instead go to a nightclub before and get drunk. This is obviously a very thin plot to start with, but thats not the problem. The problem is weird things where you as a viewer just loose touch with the movie.
It starts out with Victoria going with the four boys who are very obviously up to no good. But the movie gets back on its feet. She is a bit drunk, a bit crazy and also very lonely. She likes the guy and it all makes sense again. That ends when she gets in the car! Why get in a stolen(!) car with people you don't know(!) when you are drunk(!), going to something obviously criminal(!) when you actually have to go to work(!)? Why make the story so extreme that a normal viewer cant feel for the main character at all? Anyways, she drives them into a garage where she sees a guy with a gun and realizes what she got into. The viewer can feel her being trapped, scared and the suspense of the movie is back. But than when they leave the garage the boys tell her to leave, but she says she wants to stay, very calm and determined, no explanation. All the suspense and feeling of being trapped is suddenly replaced by ""WHAT?! WHY?!"" That is not a traditional plot hole. The movie could have forced her to stay in the car or simply skipped the whole issue all together, no problem. But the movie deliberately takes the time to make her say this ridiculous sentence.
A few things can be explained by the chaotic situation, them being drunk and well ... idiots, but even taking that into account there is still a whole lot of ""WHY?!""... - after you rob a bank, why park only a couple blocks away? - why then stay right next to the car? - why stay in a group of four? - why go to a night club with guns and 50k in cash? - why go back to the car afterwards? - when you can escape a gun fight with the police why take a taxi right next to it and pay the taxi driver 100 and then actually stay where he takes you? As soon as he hears the news, he will connect the dots. - Even the last scene is ruined... Leaving the dead guy in the room and just casually walking away with the money after an extreme night... OK, good ending! But why the f would you leave the door to the room with the dead guy open and what happened to the ambulance that was called like ten minutes earlier? It makes 0 sense. Why does the movie take the time to call the ambulance if its just gonna turn into plot hole? Just leave it out all together then...
I don't expect a perfect story, but there are just so many ""WTF?!""-moments, that it kills the movie. Of course you gonna die if you return to the getaway car that you parked just a couple of blocks away from the bank...""*** This review may contain spoilers *** M. Night Shyamalan returned with a period piece about a village in the late 19th Century plagued by strange creatures in the woods and isolated from other towns. Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) desires to venture into the town for new cures though the elders forbid it. The community thrives on their innocents and simple nature of living, though every few nights, the creatures arrive to threaten their existence and keep them happy to be safe within their walls.
The Village elders consist of Edward Walker (William Hurt) the leader, Lucius's mother Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver), a mourning widower August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson). The issue of not having proper medicine affects all the members of the community and is a major argument for sending someone to the towns for assistance. One victim of the primitive medicine is Edward's daughter Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) who was afflicted with blindness at a young age.

For the first half hour of his movie we are treated to slow mo scenes of hot blonde surfer girl walking to water, riding board, flicking hair around, watching cut scenes of monster waves from monster wave surf beaches that cannot possibly exist where she is approaching her, watch her surf these monster waves that appear out of nowhere in this tranquil Mexican bay, slow mo, hair flik, cute guys watch approvingly, etc.
Then a whale carcass pops in from out of nowhere. it appears a gigantic megalodon sized shark has bitten the top of this whale's head off...
girl get's thrown off board (while riding impossibly gigantic wave, by impossibly gigantic great white) and ends up surfing the whale. The shark is apparently NOT FULL. Girl must make it to a rock, where she spends most of the movie, with a comic relief seagull that should have been animated and have a jaunty name.
This great white is ridiculously large (JAWS II and worse size) and ridiculously HUNGRY. She's (no male could ever reach this size) already eaten HALF A WHALE... but no, she must now chow down on a succession of DUMB MEN who try to rescue our blonde in distress. At one point this hate filled sea monster tries to climb up on the rock. It also dismantles a bouy when she swims to that.
She manages to nurse having her leg almost bitten off, somehow she just keeps making more blood to gush out of her....
The final kill scene against the shark is truly cringe inspiring, with the clearly big rubber shark doll diving head first into the bottom of the ocean like a crashing jet fighter. And my respect for this garbage movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This is my first review and please apologize my English. As a father of a 7 month little creature I felt offended watching this movie, where princess Aurora loves her mother and father's assassin: this is not a tale, this is an horror movie! The plot is not just explaining why Maleficent became bad, the plot is completely different from the original Disney's movie... this is a different story! This is not ""sleeping beauty""... this is ""sleeping with the enemy"", where the enemy, from my point of view, is not her family. There is no credible or even interesting character. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Having just watched Homefront which was pretty good IMHO, this was terrible. I wish I read the reviews here before watching. Felt like I was watching a modern version of a bad 80s film. I wonder if Stratham is slipping into ""Nicholas Cage"" territory with the ""paycheck"" films. Jessica Alba didn't bring much to this film. Just a big name.
The movie did start off pretty good, then just sucked. The scenes leading up to the planning etc of each event (blueprints, sketches, etc) were ridiculous considering he only had 36hrs or something to get the job done. Who are these directors? Does anyone question what they are filming?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I haven't reviewed a movie on IMDb before even though I watch a lot of movies and spend time on the site, but I had to log on to say what a piece of crap this movie was. What a total waste of my time. There wasn't any real suspense because after the first 20 mins you know they made Keanu's character fail at every turn. The ridiculousness of it all wipes out any kind of tension that could be built. You keep thinking, ""Surely the ending will make up for this."" But no. It only makes it worse. Keanu makes one idiotic mistake after another and you have to wonder if he can really keep it up. I keep wondering if it can get any worse so I guess there was that suspense. BUt it goes on and on and never gets any better. I have to go watch some ""Death Wish"" now to get over it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** When Mr. Bailey goes bankrupt and suicidal because of a mean greedy banker, an angel is sent to show him how much worse life would be for others had he never been born to help them. But this only happens after an hour and a half of a movie that drags; it's long and slow to the point and dated. And in the end everything turns out fine in a sea of roses (sorry... money), because he helped so many people, all of them his good buddies, friends and comrades, that they save him (and his family) from bankruptcy, storming inside his home on Christmas Eve to give him money because everyone is so altruistic that time of year! Only in the movies... I only see two positives: some good camera work and scenery production.""Utter guff. Got so bored halfway through I cracked open the rum and got a lash on. Barely paid any attention to the second half but don't think I missed much. Seeing Rosario Dawson's chebs doesn't even make up for this pish. Apparently you have to write 10 lines but I'm finding it difficult to write a couple of lines about how bad this was. It doesn't help that I've drank rum, maybe that's why I didn't like it but I doubt it. Don't get me wrong, I like Danny Boyle's films but not this steaming dungheap. Did I say that I drank rum? And some Prosecco to kill the pain. I watched some mosh pits on YouTube afterwards and that cheered me up no end.""Jackman plays Keller Dover, a bully with a family and some friends. On Thanksgiving, the Dover and the Birch families meet for lunch and in the afternoon both their younger children disappear.
Enter detective Loki, played by Gyllenhaal and the hunt for the filthy kidnapper starts with the lengthy interrogation of suspect number one, Alex Jones. Alex is suitably creepy and with a shady past, but is that enough to make him a child abuser?
Drenched in the cold light of the winter season, with plenty of rain and snow, the movie manages to maintain a tense rhythm just about three quarters of the way. Then it collapses due to several problems:
- none of the main characters seems able to articulate their thoughts. A movie with one, strong silent type is OK, but here just about everybody (strong or otherwise) is extremely silent, even when keeping their mouth shut results only in getting additional beatings
- the Dover character, being an anguished father should attract some sympathy, but he is just a bully, determined to beat his way to the truth. A bully with a family is still a bully and the extreme violence Dover is capable of is not justified by the circumstances
- the ""investigation"" seems to be carried out by a single man. Detective Loki puts himself in dangerous situations without any back-up or contact with headquarters. Seems stupid and I doubt a real detective would risk that much
- the token pedophile priest is one of the semi-red herring sub plots that has been done way too often. Besides, even if this character could be relevant, he is also unable to relate his story in an intelligible way
- at the end of the movie, Dover's wife tells Loki that her husband is ""a good man"". Apart from the fact that he lied to and threatened everybody around him, bullied his friends into being his accomplices, kidnapped and tortured an innocent person and planned to do worse to somebody else.. but we are supposed to buy into his being ""good"" because he loves his child.
- over two hours of movie with very little dialogue and no sympathetic characters is way too long.""The Huntsman is a confusing, dull, flat film which obviously tries to emulate Frozen but comes across as a mess.
We have Ravanna (Charlize Theron) and her sister Freya the Ice Queen (Emily Blunt) who is betrayed by Ravenna as she had Freya's baby killed as she would grow up to be the fairest of them all.
Freya's heart goes cold and she uses children to train in her army including the Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who grows up to fall in love with Sara (Jessica Chastain) but love is forbidden in the kingdom of the Ice Queen and tragedy befalls. Some years later the Huntsman has to retrieve the magic mirror with the help of some dwarfs but Freya is also on the scent.
The comedy is unfunny, the action is mundane but at least the special effects are good but this is a poorly realised movie and an unnecessary follow up to the Snow White film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Its a bit rare that you come across a movie which is so highly acclaimed and you find it totally trash. So, I decided to write a review on the things which bothered me. I found the whole movie completely unbelievable. The characters are not convincing in there actions and things are left unexplained. The only saving grace is the acting and the humorous part of the movie which made the characters adorable, hence the 4 stars. But this was not expected from a thriller. Actually even some serious parts of the movie sounded funny to me !
- The characters played by Mary Winstead and John Gallegher plotting against the John Goodman seems unreasonable and quite frankly unverified throughout the whole movie. Is Goodman a sexual predator or simply nuts ? The viewer will never found out.
-John Gallegner's character is so easily convinced by some cock and bull story by Mary without doing any additional verification even though he knows Goodman far better than the new girl .
- The aliens killed by a bottle of scotch took the crown . This looks like a completely unbelievable aspect of the story where the aliens are shown as so stupid to fall for a fragile attempt to screw their sophisticated attack.
- The girl ""escaping"" without any remorse or realization that Goodman was only trying to protect her . She is not only responsible for destroying their sophisticated hideout but also has a hand in getting both the guys killed with her stupid and cruel actions.
- The final shot scene where she is shown heading to Houston was another funny scene. What does she think ? That she is a super hero who will be able to save the rest of humanity.
I am just amazed by how this movie has managed such a hype. I am totally disappointed .""The story solely revolves around the hardship and horrors of 'Milkha Sing' the Flying Sikh. The actor farahan Akhter has put his heart and soul in this great movie. The movie is about a athlete who faces lots of problem in his life. The women in milkha Singh life play a very important role;His sister his love or his crush. In a Brief role,Sonam prettily breezes through. Pavan and Divya are outstanding.
Every one who is associated with the film has done a great job;Director to actor. The Music heightens the Drama. in-spite the movie is long but you never feel board. Mehra is brilliant at his craft;he infuses realism int drama,and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge.
Over all Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a award winning Movie. I will give 7 out of 10.""A movie that hinges it's big ending on a major plot twist that becomes blindingly obvious 15 minutes in has basically set itself up to fail.
Maybe as an audience we've seen all manner of plot twists to the extent that we've now become pretty astute at sniffing them out.
This twist however requires no sniffing out. The director might as well have lit a glaring neon sign saying ""major plot twist under construction"" right at the start.
Aside from that this movie shows that the people responsible for bringing an artificial life form about will be the dumbest people on the planet.
In once scene Paul Giamattis character insists that he interviews his subject in the same room across a table rather than from behind a safety glass. The last time this subject sat across someone at a table, she stabbed her victim repeatedly in the eye.
Paul Giamatti now not only sits across her, but yells and goads her into giving a physical response as to how she feels. ""Show me"" he yells at her repeatedly.
No prizes for guessing what happens next.
No prizes for guessing the ending within the first 15-20 minutes of the movie either.
The only prize this movie gets from me is a blown raspberry and two thumbs down.""Back in late 2004, I saw the trailer for a movie called Cursed and I thought it would be interesting to see Christina Ricci headline a horror film. Eventually I watched it some years later. I quickly forgot about it afterwards...until...now. I think that Jesse Eisenberg is the only one worthwhile in this movie because while watching his performance, he seems to be in on the joke and he is the only one from the cast that still makes decent movies in my opinion. So many things I was thinking about during this movie like remembering when Christina Ricci was in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Buffalo '66, and how she could reduce to something so low- grade such as this. Those films were basically back-to-back in the late nineties. Now she has done only two notable movies within the past fifteen years, in my opinion. And thinking about the filmography of Wes Craven. Wasn't he at one point considered a groundbreaking filmmaker in the 70's with the original Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes? He seemed to reinvigorate himself with 1996's Scream and he gets credit for 1999's Music of the Heart. I have not seen the latter, but I know it is a step outside the genre he usually does. It seems he lost any creativity he may have had after that point. Something I have noticed in many of his movies is that there are a lot of dialogue scenes and dramatic, intense confrontations that take place in a suburban house. Perhaps it is something that became his trademark.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Well , It's my first review here , I really couldn't resist .. I just watched the movie because it has a high rating and Julianne Moore . I really was shocked of the film , gave it 2/10 only because of the last scene that I felt some comedy about it . Rest of the movie I saw no comedy at all . The story isn't that powerful and didn't sound interesting enough to me or maybe it could have been done better. I don't know why it has that high rating or what the people liked most about it but everyone has its taste for sure ..
The most boring film that I've ever seen till now .. It's my first time to leave a movie and go to sleep then continue it later ..
As for it's genre ,, It's not mysterious as it looks like , not enough crime and Surely not Comedy ..
I was expecting much more and I am really disappointed about it""That's how can one ""create"" history... It's a pity how can one of my favorite actors became a liar. I live in Russia, not in the US. I don't know how US politics act, how they speak, what they like & where they sleep. I can't say that such a man as Charly Wilson can't be shown as in this movie. But I know much more about War in Afganistan & about Soviets. And I know, WHAT was raised by such men as Charlie Wilson. So when Tom Hanks show us some poor little Afgan rebels & cruel ugly soviet soldiers I want to ask Tom: Are You Crasy? Yes, you may be proud, that The Soviet Union lost that war due to US influence, than you may be proud, that The Soviet Union crashed due to this lost, e.t.c. BUT! You may not show that ""Black"" is ""White"". You should show that terrorism in this region is raised on US money & until now no one can stop it. And that's the truth about this war - the CHAOS in the Middle East was created by such men as Charlie Wilson. These men are Criminals and should be judged, because too many people were killed, too many cities were destroyed... In 1988 I saw veterans of this war without legs & arms - they picked up from the ground toys, that where filled with explosives by Charly Wilson's ""rebels"", they were trying to help people & got fire in there backs, because Charly Wilson gave money to support bandits... And what we see in this film? Soviet soldiers, as terrorists, put explosives into toys and laugh...& throw this toys to Afgan Children... And then, WOW! Good rebels kill bad Russian soldiers!!! And people all around the world should think that it's true... And nothing about cutting off heads, teaching children to kill, making drugs, violence against women - ALL THE THINGS the Soviets tried to protect people from. Maybe You don't know, but for Russian soldiers it was an international duty - to protect people in friendly country. And they really tried to do it. Well, You may think that Russians drink vodka all day long, dance with bears & eat ice on breakfast, then this film is for You. So, on my opinion, this film is only propaganda. God, save the USA!""Now You See Me was a big hit of 2013, not brilliant, but more than adequate. The powers that be in Hollywood then decide to make a sequel which feels like a remake but far less adequate. The main cast was the same as the original, except Isla Fisher, who was replaced by Lizzy Caplan, the script was probably written over a lunch meeting, and the sets were bright and noisy, probably to avoid how little acting was going on. I remember Michael Caine when collecting one of his many awards years ago, saying that he had starred in over 100 terrible movies simply for the money, obviously he is still doing it. Avoid, unless completely bored.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If you're going into this just hoping for an action movie that you can take away some ideas from, you may be OK. If you're looking at this movie with a critical eye, it's very disappointing.
The movie was simply not believable, for a host of reasons. To name a few...
-The Moose robot has guns, cluster bombs and anti-aircraft technology.For some inexplicable reason it also has claws for decapitating humans. Why?
-The creator of the Moose robot is inexplicably a mass murderer who doesn't seem to fear the fact that he could be held accountable for killing people with his robot.
-The firm building the robots has exactly two programmers working on all the robots. Nobody knows what the other hundreds of employees do. -Their security is so lax that one programmer is able to upload a virus to all of the robots and take them offline without anyone knowing that he did it. The other programmer is able to steal a defunct robot and modify it as he sees fit - Again no one notices.
-Somehow a helmet used for controlling a robot via a human brain is modified so that people can save their consciousness to a computer?
-Uploading one's consciousness inexplicably removes it from the computer/human body that it is presently stored in? Except for when Chappie's mom's consciousness is saved to a flash drive?
-A multi billion dollar security firm doesn't have any backups of their robot firmware? They have no contingency plan for when their robots go offline?
The lack of scientific / technological understanding is just so bad. The writers clearly either didn't understand, or didn't care about the basics of how computer science works.""Of late, it's the women who are carrying the Bollywood movies on their slender but strong shoulders. Dipika Padukone has been doing it for awhile, others are not far behind either. The watchability of 'ae dil hai mushkil' too is totally dependent Anushka Sharma. The initial comedy and the old hit songs also helped but certainly not Karan Johar's self-proclaimed attempt at being intellectual! :( Also, what is it with the old songs? Undoubtedly, Bollywood has enough hit music to fill a whole year's worth of new movies - if one wanted to. But that's not what movie making is about, right? In any case, ADHM appears simply to be a mishmash of 'kal ho na ho' and other mush from KJo stables despite 'appearances'.
Psst.. what was all that hoopla about Fawad Khan??""What is wrong when you have a movie which have a great budget, good actors, really great performances (Carrie Coon especially), good sound, skillful directing, but still you barely succeed to watch it till the end?
The plot is wrong.
And in this case, terrible wrong. Most likely, the producers, even Fincher, couldn't resist to pander to the contemporary taste of a mainstream consumer. I must say that I didn't read a book upon which the film is made, but I can't get the feeling that the ""more and more and more approach"", the aspiration to make a movie which would be unique, finally lead to completely flawed structure. The beginning is fine, and all of the goods is in that part, even with some pretentious tryouts of a Rosamund Pike character to be mysterious and special.But from the middle, movie simply loses control, looking like that there is no clear picture how to get away from over dramatization. At that part, the plot shows all of the weaknesses, bringing many childish mistakes some of the reviewers already pointed out.
Finally, having this movie so highly rated, in comparison wit for example Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct is just ridiculous. Which once again, shows how problematic the IMDb rating can be.""I saw this in a DVD bargain bin today and thought, ""hmmm, a film with Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds that i've never heard of about ghost cops....I smell comedy badness potential"" and just had to see it (i am a masochist I think)
This totally deserves RedLetterMedia's Best Of The Worst Treatment! I'd say it's worth seeing just for the spectacle of a film getting everything as wrong as possible.
I am quite fascinated by this subject, so many questions! Who thought a Ghostbusters / MiB rip off was a good idea? How do movies with this bad a script and premise, on this size budget, ever get past the initial proposition / planning stages? Why do reasonably high-profile actors agree to be in them, other than ""for the money""? (i'm not including Kevin Bacon in this question, he'll be in any old *beep* these days, and maybe Ryan Reynolds wasn't too picky back then either) Wtf did they actually spend the $130mil on?
Additionally, there was so much (bad) CGI, it would be better described as a feature length video game cut-scene than a movie!
It didn't work as a story (utterly derivative - more evil portals in the sky?), it didn't work as a comedy, or a self-conscious parody if that's what they were going for (it wasn't funny), it didn't work as an action movie (GCI demo yawn), it's chock-full of wtf? scenes that made no sense. I could go on
Hilariously bad. I'm seriously starting to think that films like this are nothing more than fraud, a racket. Ever seen ""The Producers"" by Mel Brooks? And RLM did a dissection of Adam Sandler films - why they get made and how the people involved still make a load of money whether it does well or not...it's very enlightening.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** the movie starts pretty boring till minute 36 when a doctor comes to asses the AI thinking, and it ends at 47 minutes when the doctor dies.
from that moment the only reaction i received from the movie was annoy, those highly specialized people fail to put in place any safety measure to stop the AI, and they fail again and again and again
in those situations it is highly improbable that people will act so childish and accept to be killed and even in that situation they don't act
the end is pretty clear from around 47 minute and forward
TL DR for 11 minutes of decent and realistic movie (36-47) i consider this movie a waste and not advice you to waste time like i did""*** This review may contain spoilers *** People want to believe this movie was good, in fact it wasn't.
The way relationships are portrayed In Ep7 is that if someone rescues someone else they are instantly BFFs. And everyone gets on just great. And completely trusts everyone else. All the time. The only relationship between protagonists with any kind of complexity is Han/Leia.
There are more ridiculous coincidences in the first 30 minutes of Ep7 than in the original trilogy combined. It was just a series of implausible events connected by coincidence.
Copy/paste, another Death Star.
Anyone who picks up a lightsaber is instantly a master. Finn can use it without any problem, and Rey... well now that she knows the Force is real, she's a jedi and can fight a highly trained Sith.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** AtJack Reacher Never Go Back...there's only one way to describe this film and that is a waste of time I can't believe looked forward to watching this it was one of my most anticipated of 2016 when I saw the trailer it looked awesome just dynamic and action packed but I was wrong this is not what I expected I was really let down it was such a disappointment and there was hardly any action the whole time they were just running from the people who had framed them it wasn't clear for what they were just running from some bad guy and it was unclear why he was after them why he wanted them dead. I mean it's not the actors it's the script and the film itself I give it credit for the acting Tom Cruise is good as Jack Reacher and so is Cobie Smulders as Major Susan Turner but the story was bad,the writing was bad everything else was just bad I really wouldn't recommend this even if you're a fan of the original which I am this is Hollywood trash but they will keep making films like this because there will always be an audience for it I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters which I was going to but in the end decided against it I really have never been happier that I didn't do that don't waste your time watch a good action/thriller film instead I use that term loosely because like I said hardly any action and wasn't thrilling.""Started watching it because well its been out a few years and I haven't seen it, half way through I realize I have seen it, but surely I was interrupted before finish, right? And when I get to the end I must admit I have seen all of it before, it was just so utterly unmemorable I completely forgot about it. ""Force Awakens"" is a sad, sad attempt at recreating ""A New Hope"", Disney must have figured they can just take the New Hope storyline change some characters, throw out all the meat and hey presto, a new episode. Prequel trilogy will live in infamy for daring to break from the model of original trilogy, but episodes 7 and probably 8 and 9 will just be forgotten in trashbox of movie history with all the other crap.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Nocturnal Animals sums up what happens when fashion meets film- one big boring yawn.
My one vote goes to Michael Shannon, who played his role well but not really a believable character. As a dying cop at the end of his career, I'm not convinced vigilant shootings for a stranger would be a top priority.
As others have noted, while the scenes seem to be going somewhere, the whole thing falls apart with too many backstory shifts along with ridiculous fillers of bourgeois emptiness.
It's shallow, it's narcissistic and void of emotional depth.
The audience is left hanging with characters that stir very little emotion connection. There is no on-screen tension or suspense between the characters either.
No rhyme or reason to the closing scene. Perhaps Ford thinks he's mastered a creative or experimental ending but it just doesn't work.
A better take on experimental endings of a similar genre is No Country for Old Men.
For me, Nocturnal Animals is not worth the yawn.""The action is fun, but much of the dialogue was corny, predictable, and eye- roll-worthy. A couple of the characters were slightly nauseating, (Haley Bennett's one-dimensional acting, historically inaccurate clothing/vocabulary, and Vincent D'Onofrio's strange-almost-comical religious mutterings as he bludgeons). Overall, the acting left much to be desired (although a lot of that was due to a poor script), and the speech/vocab was way too modern for the post-civil war era.
I'm sure some could say similar things about the 1960 classic, but the legendary coolness of Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn MORE than make up for it.""This story and its big drama is the kind of thing Humphrey Bogart did often after he had success with ""Casablanca"". That is not the only thing that connects this movie with Bogart; it is a very traditional, even well-worn, type of Hollywood movie. The Bogart fare was melodramatic and plotted very carefully and in those elements this film fails considerably.
The story is small but as it goes it is rather dull, no other word for it, it is dull. It lacks drive and purpose and some unifying idea for the audience to connect with after the grace period, say 20 minutes, when we still don't know how it will develop.
The writing is truly lamentable; if this is what it takes to get a movie deal now the product is bound to be awful The pitch meeting on the project would have been the most exciting thing because the execution, in the script and on screen is lifeless, aimless and lacking in drama.
Then there are the anachronisms, the language Pitt uses to superiors, the way people greet each other, the sense that non one had the faintest idea of what the 1940s was like. The birth sequence deserves special citation: risible doesn't do it justice, it must be in the top 3 worst and ludicrous scenes ever shot in the last 40 years.
As history is not what this film was really about when Pitt seeks to prove, or otherwise, his wife's veracity, and she has to pay a well-known national anthem, it seemed perfectly fine if she offered up some other tunes, for instance: ""Die Fahne-hoch"", ""Die Wacht am Rhein"", neither Pitt, nor the director, nor writer would have known the difference.
And in the end it reaches it's terrible conclusion and delivers an unwanted epilogue which adds a mawkishness to the whole experience. It also signifies how bad the script was that it had to append such a long-winded and pointless conclusion to the work.
It's lucky for Bogie that he never saw this, and its for sure that he would have passed on it, because he was a real professional who knew a dud if he'd been offered it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am giving ""The Great Wall"" a low rating not because I am angry about the story of a white man saving the world. I am reviewing it as a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie solely based on its entertainment value. Even with this mindset, this movie is still a catastrophic failure.
Before I start talking about what failed, let us first take a look at what worked for this movie. I feel that the plot has no major flaw, the VFX is amazing as expected, the 3 white actors' performance are convincing, the set and costumes are well designed. So what really went wrong with it? In short, the main actress did a terrible job playing her role. Secondly, a great many of the supporting roles seem to be redundant.
Jing Tian - The main actress did such a terrible job playing a female general who was supposed to have grown up in an army and had trained her entire life for the war. But she failed to display a least trace of real toughness or tenacity, which logically speaking, this character must possess. She was merely struggling to be a ""someone you don't want to mess up with"" for the first 10 mins of her screen time. Then, in the next scene, she showed up looking like an innocent, naive school girl, who magically brain-washed Matt Damon's character to fight the war by just repeating the word ""trust"" over and over again. Her ridiculous performance will make you wonder - How the hell did she turn Matt Damon from a selfish mercenary into a hero to save the world? Mind control?
Most of the supporting roles don't help to develop the story at all, they seem to be totally redundant. What annoyed me the most is that, except for Andy Law and another guy, the rest of the supporting roles are not even played by proper actors. Singers, members of teenage boy band, variety show stars, people with almost no acting experience appeared in this movie as supporting roles to get their fans into the cinema. The result is that most of the supporting characters feel like zombies. So as an audience, you don't care about their life and death, you don't feel anything when seeing one of them being eaten alive by a monster.
Even for a Hollywood blockbuster film, you have to get the basics correct for it to be entertaining. The director - Zhang Yimou used to be a great story teller and an expert at picking the right actor for his character. Apparently, he was not doing his job in this one.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Please forgive me but I am just mesmerized by the people here who are giving this movie a 5 star, or a 4 star, or a 3 star, or even a 2 star. This has to be one of the most awful movies both my husband and I have ever seen. A total waste of 2 hours. Nothing made sense and the ending? What the hell again? And the child in the movie? The plot kept jumping from one thing to another and having tried endlessly to understand what was going on we just couldn't get there. We couldn't figure out if the aliens were just hovering outside of the ship or actually inside. I have to say that the acting was actually OK but to consider this movie for an academy award....Nah! Don't waste your time.""This movie has the worst score I've ever heard in my life. Seriously. It reminds me of a military siren. Just awful.
I find Natalie Portman's acting and especially her accent extremely unnatural and distracting. Sorry, but I think it's far from an Oscar worthy performance.
The entire movie feels extremely uncomfortable to watch. You need to see it yourself to understand what I'm talking about. Plus, it got a strong sense of Oscar bait and I don't bite it: An entire movie revolving around one actor, reenacting events of a historical figure. And for me it fails flat. It feels like a student project.
Watching the real ""White House broadcast"" (which was recreated in the movie), Jackie's accent and way of talking (and general way of behavior throughout the entire broadcast) is extremely unnatural too. Still, I think Portman makes it even MORE unnatural and uncomfortable.""Villains basically wear name badges that say ""Hello, I'm A Villain"". New powers emerge that literally every member of their race could easily possess. And characters who they couldn't afford to cast are lazily written out of the story.
The ending of the movie is just sort of tacked on giving little weight to the enormity of what it actually would mean for future films of which they seem to set up.
All in all, it's an Underworld movie, just probably the worst one.
If you've seen any of the other entries into the Underworld universe than you won't really be surprised at what you get with this one."OK the movie was good to a point. Acting wasn't good and the way they set it up was weird. The one thing that this website did not include on the parent guide is that there is a few sex scenes. Normally I look it up to double check it's OK to have my kids watch. I went and saw it (thankfully without my son) and was surprised what was in the content. Besides that the movie did have a few jump scares but I think they could've done a lot better with the whole thing. Story line was interesting but the way they set some stuff up just left you with more questions than anything was answered. It honestly wasn't the worse horror movie I've ever seen but it definitely wasn't the best either."*** This review may contain spoilers *** Had good heart and good acting (especially Aamir Khan) and the cinematography during the fights were pretty alright but the child actors were pretty bad and the movie was really, REALLY formulated and predictable. (also the message was good, but Cool Cat Save the Kids has a good message. why doesn't that have a 9.1 on IMDb?)
Spoilers from here on out:
At the end when she needs the points to win, it was the EXACT amount Aamir Khan said earlier in the movie, and there was 10 seconds left. hmmm... wonder whats going to happen... and then on top of that, we hear Aamir Khan repeating what the throw is to get the amount of points (i don't remember how many, so lets just say it was 7) at that moment. SERIOUSLY?!?!? It was pretty obvious when Aamir Khan said it the first time that it would be re-incorporated. Then towards the end of the fight when she needs exactly 7 points to win, and the only way to get that is the throw, you know its going to happen. The movie insults your intelligence by just SAYING IT AGAIN.
Also, I had no idea what was going to happen in this movie. The day of my parents said that there was an Aamir Khan movie near us in theaters so we just went and saw it. I had NO idea of what was going to happen in this movie at all. I didn't look anything up or anything, yet I could still predict what would happen in the movie.
another thing to add: the motivation for why the girls continued to fight in the beginning was kind of dumb. Instead of realizing by themselves that women are oppressed in India and they are given a chance, they are just told this by some random girl who we see for the first time who gets married. It was forced and bad. I don't write movies but they could have done this in a way that the girls found out by themselves, which really would have developed their characters more (imo).""This film is pure propaganda. No one was hurt at the 'Boston Bombing' because it was a planned drill, using crisis actors, and underwritten by U.S. Homeland Security. Wake up folks! Fake blood moulage was poor, and 'victims' stumbling around with torn up jeans was laughable--google Boston Hoax today and educate yourself.
Sure, this film will tug on your heartstrings and make you feel very emotional and angry--that's what good propaganda films do. The goal is to divide and conquer the masses. Fake terrorism is good business for the Defense Department.
Any time CNN runs a story non-stop you have to ask yourself--is this a real event or fake? Was a drill happening at the same time? Do your research, then decide if the event was a false-flag or not.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** OK I just want to try to lessen the confusion about the Death Race movies.
The 1st movie should be watched 4th, the 2nd should be 3rd, the 3rd should be 1st the 4th should be 2nd, the 5th don't bother and the 6th...well...we will see.
OK that didn't help, but this might. ;)
This is supposedly the order they should be watched in:
Death Race 2 (2010)
Death Race Inferno (2013)
Death Race (2008)
Death Race 2000 (1975)
Death Race 2060 (2017)
Death Race Anarchy (2018)
Death Race 2 (2010) This is a prequel to Death Race 2000 with the introduction of the character Frankenstein and the 1st Death Race match. But also includes Sean Bean's character watching the original Death Race movie on TV during this Movie before they decide to invent Death Race.
Death Race Inferno (2013) This is a sequel to Death Race 2 with same actors and characters in the main roles. Also, prequel to Death Race 2000.
Death Race (2008) This was originally been going to be a sequel to Death Race 2000 but due to production costs the ambitious idea they had been scrapped and then some also say it's a remake but also like the previous 2 movies it's more of a prequel...work that one out lol. Some actors in the above movies were also in this as the same characters. David Carradine is the voice of the Frankenstein character and we see the character Machine Gun Joe for the 1st time played by Tyrese Gibson.
Death Race 2000 (1975) In the time line this is supposed to follow Death Race 2, Death Race Inferno and Death Race (2008) Sort of. You can now see the results from them not making up their mind what to make Death Race (2008) as Machine Gun Joe is white played by some actor called Sylvester Stallone ;) and David Carradine is Frankenstein who's voice we heard as Frankenstein in Death Race (2008) just before the then black Machine Gun Joe played by Tyrese Gibson killed him and was replaced by Jason Statham. Like the end of the 2008 movie they are now out of prison but the relationship between Frankenstein and Joe does not match the 2008 movie. There is also no Goldberg, Coach or Lists character in this. It feels really dated now but does feature lots of breasts. ;)
Death Race 2050 (2017) This was originally advertised as sequel to the other above movies and said to be finally a true sequel to Death Race 2000 Featuring once again Frankenstein character and his co-driver from Death Race 2000 Annie Sullivan. However just before watching it I saw it said sequel or soft reboot. Unfortunately it's the latter as the story does not follow on from Death Race 2000, Annie meets Frank for the 1st time, but they got Married in Death Race 2000. Does not feature Joe and once again features breasts plus some gore but that doesn't save the movie as it's style feels totally outdated. They tried to make this more comedy but none of it is funny. I personally enjoyed the 1st 3 movies in this list the most and this is the worst.
Death Race Anarchy (2018) This looks like this will be back to normal with Lists and Goldberg actors reprising their roles plus there is a Frankenstein character listed but long way down the list.
Whether you watch them in the order they are listed here or watch Death Race 2000 1st followed by Death Race 2050 and then the rest in the above order as a complete reboot is up to you. I would recommend watching them in order above and totally forget Death Race 2050.
By the way:
Deathsport (AKA Death Race 2050) (1978) This claims to be sort of sequel to Death Race 2000 but with motor bikes and also stars David Carradine but not as his Death Race 2000 character.
Cannonball (AKA Carquake) (1976) This one also starring David Carradine, plus uncredited appearance by Sylvester Stallone and directed by same director as Death Race 2000 is believed not to be connected. Neither is The Cannon Ball Run (1981), Cannonball Run II (1984) and Cannonball Fever (AKA Speed Zone) (1989).
The Gumball Rally (1976) This is not connected.
Death Racers (AKA Death Race 3000) (2008) This is another mockbuster movie from Asylum Movie company and is a cash-in on the 2008 Death Race. It features none of the characters from any of the Death Race movies and is bad even for an Asylum movie.
Need for Speed, Cars ;) and Fast & Furious franchises are not connected to the Death Race franchise.
Death Race (1976 video arcade game) This game was inspired by Death Race 2000. The game was remade in 1990.
Carmageddon (1997 video game) This game was also inspired by Death Race 2000.
Maze Death Race (1982 video game) and Deathtrack (video game) These might have also been inspired by Death Race 2000.
Roadwar 2000 (1986 computer game) This game was not inspired by Death Race but more based on Mad Max.
And finally.
In Death Race 2 we hear about a company called Weyland which was also in the Alien film franchise, not sure if there is a connection other than one of the producers and writers of Death Race 2 was also a producer and writer of Alien vs Predator.
Drive carefully now. :)""This is about the worst movie I have seen in the last year. It's not often that I want all of the characters to die quickly. It's also the first Fassbender movie that I've not enjoyed in any way.
The story meanders. It's filled with characters I really don't care about. The flashbacks are impressive feats of practical effects and physical endurance, but, they bore me to tears. It's the usual ""over the top"" ninja warrior crap that we are sick of seeing. The only difference in this movie is that there is a male ninja warrior for once.
Marion Cotillard is usually superb in movies. What was she thinking? Her role is political correctness in overdrive. The father lavishing her with praise because she's a female? If Cotillard wasn't asleep through boredom, she would have ditched such a pathetic attitude to her character that a father would NEVER say to a son. The movie was filled with this sexist crap (eg. trust a MAN to take the credit for what a woman did). It's nauseating. The director clearly has gender issues.
If there's one thing that Justin Kurzel (the director) got right, it was the female Asian assassin (we had to have). She wasn't 10x stronger than any other character.
If you are interested in physical effects, plenty of sexism, boring characters and don't care about story, this IS your movie. If you like relatable characters, a believable story and don't want sexism rammed down your throat, this is NOT your movie. I really should have given this movie 1/10 but the practical effects upped the score.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Although there are a few nicely shot scenes such as 'crowd collection' or fancy assisted suicide procedure, the core premise just doesn't hold water. First of all, there's nothing wrong with cannibalism per se, as long as it doesn't involve purposeful killing of humans and only relies on those who deceased naturally or according to their own will. One of the final lines mentioned 'breeding people like cattle' to make food, which is now horrible indeed, except how are you going to feed the cattle? See a catch 22 here?
It would be quite an interesting movie if it considered more seriously what would happen in the case of plankton' disappearance, but as it is I'm struggling to give it even 4/10.""Career bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney) busts out of jail with the help of his old friend and ex-prison inmate Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames). The pair plan to pull off one last job by robbing Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks) who is one of Foley's ex-prison mates, but complications ensue when Foley falls for Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) a US Marshal tasked with bringing him in and another former prison inmate Snoopy Maurice Miller (Don Cheadle) also decides that he is going to rob Ripley as well...
Out Of Sight is a promising little film that is alive and energetic (for about the first 10 minutes), but sadly it just isn't able to sustain this kind of momentum throughout its rather generous 120 minute running time...
Although it's clearly a major part of the story I personally thought that the idea of a US Marshal falling in love with a career bank robber was completely ridiculous, but I might have found this scenario enjoyable if it had been played out in an amusing and entertaining manner. The fact that we're actually meant to take it serious is preposterous and if I'm honest this aspect alone sucked most of the life out of the film. Some of J Lo and Clooney's scenes together seem to show evidence of a director who may have been more in love with the leads than they were with themselves. In fact to call some of it 'self-indulgent' would be an understatement.
Out Of Sight is another film with a non-linear narrative which again isn't a problem for me, but I did feel that certain scenes were included that served no real purpose in the story; the character of Snoopy Miller is given quite a large backstory from when he was in prison and about him being a boxer and how he met Foley etc. Yes I get that Miller is relevant to the story, but what relevance did all of the above have to the story? Would it have made any difference if Miller and Foley simply met on the outside? To me a lot of this felt like padding and I just felt that if Soderbergh stretched this film anymore it would snap. The same thing could be said for Michael Keaton who shows up in the film for about 10 minutes in a worthless role that added absolutely nothing to the film (it was an uncredited role according to IMDb).
I'm always prepared to forgive some flaws within a film if it is either interesting or entertaining, but Out Of Sight doesn't even fulfil these basic needs. What story there is seems to be pretty much forgotten until about the last 15 minutes and prior to this you're left with an uninteresting and jarring narrative and J Lo and Clooney either stalking each other or making doe eyes at each other. The only things really running in this film's favour is Clooney and Rhames' chemistry and the film also benefits from good performances from the principal cast (particularly Rhames and Cheadle who rarely disappoint).
Out Of Sight is pedestrian, meandering, sluggish and dull and even the sight of an impossibly attractive J Lo being in this film isn't enough for me to be able to recommend it.""This movie is a big, steaming pile of crap.
I mean there's literally nothing else I could say to describe how bad it is.
The Invitation is hands down the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching.
The best part of the movie is when the end credits start rolling.
Unfortunately I have to write 10 Lines about this movie when it can be summed up with one word: Godawful.
As Charles Barkley would say ""This movie is turrible""
This movie was like my prom date, got me all worked up but there was no big payoff at the end of the night
When I'm lying on my death bed, my only regret will be that I wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my life watching this dumpster fire of a movie.
Anyone associated with the making of this film should retire immediately and solemnly swear they'll never make another movie again. Ever.
From the ridiculous plot that moves like a slug covered in salt to the laughable, anticlimactic ending, this movie is a world class dud.""A transport ship carrying around 40 passengers crash-lands on an unknown planet and only 11 people survive the crash. The survivors of the crash are initially concerned about one of the survivors of the crash namely Richard B Riddick (Vin Diesel) as he is a dangerous and violent criminal that they have been transporting who manages to set himself free after the crash. However, when the planet that they crash-land on is plunged into a month-long period of darkness, the survivors soon learn that Riddick may be their only hope of survival when a group of flesh-eating aliens try to take them all out one by one...
To me, Pitch Black is an example of a potentially good film that unfortunately has been placed in the hands of the wrong director. In order to work, films like Pitch Black need to have tension, suspense, dynamism and strong characterisation and it's clear from a very early stage that you are not going to get any of that here.
Pitch Black is clearly trying to set itself up as a modern day Alien type film, but Twohy has none of the skills that Ridley Scott or James Cameron were able to serve up with the first two Alien films. I'll admit that the first 20 minutes or so were relatively suspenseful, but it's clear that after Twohy's rather clichéd 'cloak and dagger approach' in respect of introducing Riddick to the story that he had nowhere really to go and completely fails to develop or improve upon the story. When watching Pitch Black there is just no spark, no dynamism and nothing interesting about the story or the characters. Even the character of Riddick is poorly developed and I'm sure that he could have been made more interesting with a better director or writing crew.
The last few lines in the above paragraph really sum up the problems with this film; if your narrative's success is dependent on its characters then it's generally a good idea to make at least one or two of them interesting - this is what made Alien and Aliens both work because you cared about the characters and actually gave a damn about what happened, but in Pitch Black the characters are as lifeless as the planet that they crash-land on and if I'm honest I found it a bit of a struggle getting to the finish line with this one.
The performances aren't great either with no-one really making much of an impact (no pun intended). Vin Diesel should have been great in this sort of role, but I felt that he was slightly hampered by being a rather poorly written character. Everyone else here was just as bland and unmemorable.
One final thing that made me laugh about this film is its ridiculous plot contrivance; our prisoner happens to have had his eyes surgically altered so that he can see better in the dark after being denied sunlight for lengthy periods. He then finds himself crash-landed on a planet that ends up being plunged into darkness for a month??? I can suspend some disbelief, but that is quite a ridiculous coincidence don't you think???
Pitch Black is rubbish, but it's not even enjoyable rubbish and in my opinion you're better off watching either Alien or Aliens because they at least are both entertaining, tense and rewarding pieces of cinemas which are qualities that certainly cannot be attributed to Pitch Black.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In the months leading up to the release of the 2014 RoboCop remake, I was trying really hard to stay positive about the whole thing. It had a stellar cast, the effects didn't look too bad, sure It was PG 13 but that didn't mean It had to be terrible, and the way I looked at It was that It couldn't possibly be worse than RoboCop 3 ... well It wasn't, but I wasn't right to have any hope for it. The 2014 remake of RoboCop is a bland emotionless example of Hollywood using a well known name to draw In some quick and easy Box Office money. For all the film stars an ensemble cast that includes Joel Kinnaman, Samuel L Jackson, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Jackie Earl Haley, the movie just puts all their names to shame as It puts them in stereotypical boring roles that offer nothing interesting to the film. Joel Kinnaman plays a poor attempt at a recreation of RoboCop, Sam Jackson plays a television presenter that gets all of 10 maybe 15 minutes of screen time, Gary Oldman plays a scientist that is pretty much just that ... there's no character there really. And then Keaton and Haley play the antagonists of the film, Keaton fills in for Dick Jones as the CEO of Omnicorp whilst Haley feels like a less cool, more pathetic version of Clarence Bodikker and I honestly don't think I've ever seen a fantastic cast like that be so mistreated by the film they're starring in. The only remotely refreshing thing to come out of RoboCop is the element of Murphy's family being brought into the film, and to be honest even that isn't all that great ... mind you there is one cool scene in the training scenario with Haley's character. But other than that RoboCop 2014 aimed high but fell disastrously. Hell they even made Lewis a guy for some reason.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Yes I joined IMDb just to say - please don't think this film is in any way accurate. Secondly - please don't watch it for fun! The invention of the world's first super computer should not go down like this. I also cringe to think of people discussing the war with what they learned in this film. I don't think it's even a stand alone good romance / historical fiction either. The boiled down plot is very childish, makes little sense as it dawdles emotionally along. Ahem - there was a wee war on? Where's the flight / fight that would be in effect...
SPOILER ALERT
If you want to know anything about the real story please watch the English documentary Codebreakers, containing actual mathematical techniques used in cracking codes.The movie lacks any actual maths or cryptography at all. And the docu also shares more info about Turin and Flower's futures after the war which I found fascinating. I won't spoil that for you! Seriously cool men did all this, not just one guy.
Cumberpatch is one of my fave actors too. Very disappointed he got involved in such a ruination of two of the most important historical stories of the 20th C. It's not often that real life is so much more interesting that a film! The acting is solid, although hugely similar to most of his other stock performances, so no new angle except for his sad eye moments... bit of an eek addition to his portfolio. Victimy without having much charisma. From what I understand in real life, Turin was really quite dapper, they weren't having a popularity contest down at Bletchley park because, ...there was a WAR going on! Being gay / bullied / unpopular not as important as saving your country! Of course IRL he got in trouble after people found out he was gay. It was the 40s. And there was no mention in real life of fully incompetent superiors, this is just thrown in for extra bullying effect I guess!
Also he words that they say in the movie helped them to crack enigma are fully bogus and never appeared in the real transmissions. Not in code. It wasn't even enigma !?! it was a machine Hitler called TULLY. Enigma was broken 10 years prior by the Polish! There were no woman on the crack team of maths heads who of course had no say in what info was later shared. So much unimaginative fantasy. Really could be the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I quite like Keira also.
NOTE TO CREW: don't go making movies about something super important that the allies can be so proud of and then mix it up with Alice in Wonderland and a 12 year old's expose on bullying please.
Also there is also a heavy touch of... ''straights won't be able to sympathise with gay people unless they've been bullied severely'' in it. Very unnecessary.
Please believe I'm not a continuity geek really, this was just so bad as well as historically inaccurate. I was so looking forwards to it too. I left it playing in the sitting room I walked out before the last 15 minutes, after thinking how stoopid it was that the main (imaginary) woman in the story married a homosexual that had never kissed her, and 6 months later with some kind of straight face managed to look mildly surprised that he was not straight after he confessed to her. It would have made more sense if she had burst out laughing or cried. But no - I guess as an actor she had lost interest in the floundering plot at that point also. I did end up going back to and check what facts they shared with the audience at the end of the movie, just seemed to be the tragic gay only based facts really.
Come on. I mean doesn't it even seem too ridiculous, the story line? A socially awkward mathematician with no military training being allowed to judge what info to share with his immediate superiors? Being made an honorary spy? If Britain had been this crap at intelligence the war would never have been won, honestly. This movie had the chance to put the yanks straight, that the British codebreaking won the war more for the allies than the American input at the end of the war. Hmm... these producers are American...
Please watch Codebreakers the documentary, especially if you have an interest in problem solving. I didn't enjoy having to bring back the word Bogus.
Pros: close ups of the machine (and woolly vests) were interesting. But the starring computer was not called what the movie called it : Christopher (too gay lol), but was really known as Colossus. I think the story of the invention of the world's first super computer / computer deserved a much more valiant effort, what lazy film making.
I will be blacklisting this group of directors / screen writers from my future viewings as I really don't respect how they think, feel, or handle facts. Beware WEINSTEIN BROTHER's PRODUCTIONS! NOT WORTH viewing.""We the people have collectively manholes covers sitting on/over their heads; they (the mob) have willfully lost the capacity for creative thinking in the arts and other sciences, and so judgments' in regards to quality of so-called bottom feeding consumer entertainments are paralleling, that non-thinking, as a priority. For the born again yahoo flat landers who've been so oppressed in the counter culture of backwardness, which they also presume to love and take pleasure in, have shrunken to such smallness as to accept and delight in any mere excessive fusion of violence through canned manipulations of sight and sound. Rather than carry a seamless conception of true creative beauty through tapping into some instances, which replicate possible potential of the mind, even in such a low/lesser medium, as the currently almost total absurdity of so-called films, which by degree could be all elevated should a greater people come forward and thus demand that in the culture of their society. These so-called films are a very expensive overhead and total drain (mental, moral, and financial) on entire real physical economy, and such corrupting non-industry demands that its minions remain absolute controlled doltish fools who crave, and feed, it's less than uselessness perpetually. Rather than support those monsters feed your mind/soul, and certainly never wait upon such ignorance, or worse, by paying for it!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I am truly disappointed.
Beside the book, the movie is just a continuous, fast-forward dynamic escape from the maze. The story between Thomas and Teresa (especially the telepathic conversations), the friendship between Thomas and Chuck and the conflict between Thomas and Gally are not exploited even at minimum.
In other words, the movie seems like it doesn't give you time to fall in love or to truly hate some characters or couples.
Without those, you can't visualize the perspective of the author about the life in the maze. Even the exploring was made fast- forward. In the book you get a bigger picture of what the maze was, you travel with Thomas, you understand the maze..
Without those, the movie is just a typical post-apocalyptic experiment made on a selected group of people.
I am kind of scared of what the next movie brings; maybe it will destroy even more the original story...""While watching the first 15 min. I was thinking that this is just the sort of film I really like, science fiction with a little humour. I don't mean Star Wars or anything like that. Just one idea, the end of the world in this case, and then examine the effect this has on different people in different situations.
In fact, I would recommend the first 15 min. to anyone. It's really well done.
Unfortunately the film then turned into a love story. Not my cup of tea at all, especially as for me the chemistry between the two lead characters just didn't work.
I watched it to the end but only because I was impressed with the start.
To sum up:- I would advise anybody to watch the first 15 min.
I advise everybody to stop watching if they find it becomes boring, because that's just how the rest of the film is.""Resident Evil: Afterlife was a stark and precipitous drop off from its predecessors. Besides being one long rock video with bad CGI, the acting was poor as well as the plot. Not to mention that at times I didn't know if I was watching Resident Evil, Tremors, Silent Hill or The Matrix.
Let me say this: I get that slow motion and stop motion makes an action sequence cool but chill out a bit willya. It was way overdone like a child playing with his newest toy. Take out half the slow motion scenes and the movie is ten minutes shorter.
Speaking of the action scenes: there's action and then there's ""come on, get real."" I'm all for bending the laws of physics at times for an exciting movie but my brain has a certain point in which it refuses to ignore the blatant impossibilities. More than once I found myself rolling my eyes at the otherworldly stunts. Just tell me they're in the Matrix so I can mentally accept what I'm seeing. The extreme action and the paradoxically calm faces that accompanied it were too much to bear.
There is yet another exception I have with this movie. It's not fair but my idea of zombies has been largely defined by The Walking Dead and George Romero. Resident Evil is a totally different production, I know, and furthermore it's based upon a video game which probably has a totally different set of rules for its hordes of mobile carcasses. For all I know, the undead beings in Resident Evil aren't even zombies; they may be another creation entirely. But, since they look like zombies and behave like zombies I'm holding them to the zombie rules.
So, with that, I have certain expectations that were thoroughly defied in this movie. I found these zombies to be fast, strong, slightly cognitive and able to be silent when needing the element of surprise. Look, that is not my vision of a zombie and it's simply not fair. Part of the reason zombies are slow, dumb and weak is that 1.) they're dead and all higher brain functions have ceased and 2.) there are millions of them!! They already have a significant advantage in that they can only be killed with head shots (which is tough enough as it is) then you make their numbers multitudinous which is a recipe for invincibility as a species. There's no need after that to also make them strong, fast, sneaky and somewhat smart. The remaining humans have no chance!
Overall this movie just lacked intelligence and originality. They really went the mindless action movie route while liberally borrowing thematic and cinematic ideas from so many other known movies. The bottom line is they didn't even try and that's the saddest part.""How? Why? What in the world? I'm 20 mins into this garbage and I can't take it anymore. It is that bad. It is horrible.
Everything about it is bad: the casting, the acting, the script, the makeup, the wardrobe - everything. Owen Wilson agreed to do this? How? Why? The characters aren't believable, the ""comedy"" is superbly cheesy slapstick with a generous serving of crass and gross to boot.
This is yet another movie to add to the list of ""how in the world did this get made?"" Why is Hollywood producing this garbage? Is The Producers for real, and the producers of this and other recent movies making money off flops? Because there is no other explanation.""I watched Funny Games a few years ago but I think I was distracted and didn't approach it with a critical eye. It may be a good thing that I didn't at the time.
IMDb states for the description of Funny Games: ""Two psychopathic young men take a family hostage in their cabin.""
Now I want to start with a disclaimer that I love home intrusion movies. The thought of your safety being ruined by anything is terrifying. Home should be your safe place and there should be nothing unwanted that invades that space. That is why movies like The Strangers, Inside, You're Next, or Panic room work so well.
Funny Games starts off with an upper class family, played her by Naomi Watts, Time Roth and Devon Clearhart, drive to a lake property. Almost immediately they get a visit from a young man Peter (Brady Corbet in a great performance) that is introduced as a friend of a neighbor. From the moment he enters the home of our family we know that things are not all right. He is joined by his co nemesis Paul (played by the always creepy Michael Pitt).
The moment they are in the families home our villains set off a horrible 12 hours for our characters.
I am dedicated to making sure my reviews are spoiler free. With that I will say that there is a lot of nothing happening in my opinion. There is the start of what could be some horrible situations but they seem to not come to fruition.
There is also a lot of breaking the 4th wall in this movie. The hardest thing I had with this movie though is the characters. All of our family members are in a crisis and yet they seem to not know or care. The moments that really tore me apart seemed to have little to no significance to the characters. They go through slow movements and I feel were supposed to create a tension that the audience was supposed to buy. Unfortunately, I didn't buy and I wanted a refund.
This is a shot-for-shot remake, even the sets were reused, of the directors 1997 version of the same film. The director wanted to show audiences his ""moralistic comment about the influence of media violence on society"". The ending included one of the most worse twists. I know there was a moral message I was supposed to feel. The problem was none of the characters were feeling it either so I could not connect with them.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Almost every single incident that occurs throughout this entire movie, every line, every bump, every movement, is a coincidental plot device used to assist one of the main characters in escaping some sort of predicament or overcoming some obstacle which they may encounter. This occurs so often and (might I add) with the subtlety of a giant neon sign with flickering lights displaying the words- ""PLEASE NOTICE THIS ITS IMPORTANT BUT WE WONT TELL YOU WHY""-It's almost insulting to the viewers intelligence. This is a movie about the subtle art of slight of hand and illusion its supposed to be mysterious, at least attempt to be subtle in your ""coincidental plot devices"" I know this is a fictional story and in such cases we can be liberal with reality, fine i accept that; however if you are going to give not one but three of the characters the ability to instantly hypnotize people, making them do basically whatever the hell you damn well please, the rest of the show, the fancy lights the trickery all that just seems pointless. Oh but there is a catch people can only be hypnotized when they are off guard. Fine wait for mr baddie to be off guard do your vodoo magic on his mind and make him give his money back to the poor or whatever it is you require. What are the rest of the horsemen needed for. I can go on and on and on and on but you get the point. Don't try to be a ""who dunnit"" type mystery when you can make anyone do what you want when you want that's goes be on lazy writing.""I recently had the opportunity to see Good Will Hunting for the second time. I had not seen it since its video release in 1997. It's funny how nearly twenty years can change your opinion about a movie. I was lukewarm to the film back then, but now - older and wiser - I see it in a new light.
I had initially dismissed this film as a two hour study of a bunch of unlikeable and unbelievable people. But now it is evident that Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the title character, the good Will Hunting.
Damon does a yeoman's job making us believe in someone who is not only a math genius with a photographic memory, but a barroom- brawler, cynic, janitor, lover, and all-around down-to-earth working-class joe. Damon and his compadre Ben Affleck also deserved their Oscar screenplay win for creating a character more fantastic than any from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.
Robin Williams also deserved his Oscar win for having us buy his interpretation of an all-knowing beard-sporting eye-glinting joke- cracking-but-no-nonsense psychologist.
Affleck, director Gus Van Sant, and the rest of the cast merit mention as well for trying to get us to like and accept all the unappealing and implausible characters who populate this fantasy world.
All this leads me to believe that I should revisit films like Showgirls, The River Wild, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and The Greek Tycoon. Maybe I was a little too harsh in my initial assessment of those as well.
Yeah, right.""Let me preface by saying I've seen thousands of movies. I've seen many of the movies often regarded as the worst. Plan 9, the room, Tarzoon, underground comedy, puppet master sequels, paranormal activity sequels, an American Hippie in Israel, highlander 2, Catwoman etc. I've seen almost every Adam Sandler film and Steven Seagal, every rob Schneider, Nick Cage, Pauly Shore, and Van Damme. Obscure gay independent films and films meant to create a state of mind like being on drugs. My point is that I have every basis for comparison when I say the following: Enter the Void is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It has no redeeming qualities. From the Bafflingly awful direction to Weaponized dialogue used to attack the audience all the way to the twist at the end, only surprising inasmuch as you wouldn't believe someone would have the balls to make it that lame and uninteresting. The bizarre birds eye shots and shifts in camera angle give the viewer the impression that this was not really a movie. Not so much as an art project for students wanting to reproduce the effects of torture. It is not bad in a fun way, it is not campy, it is not ironic. It is just painful. Worth seeing only to calibrate your opinion of all other movies. This is bedrock with nowhere to go but up. If a perfect movie were a 10 then enter the void would define 0. Unfortunately the system won't let me rate that low.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Sorry but I grew up living and loving musicals but this is tripe. None of the ""stars"" are of the expected style or standard. The story is grotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I kept wanting someone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands, Stones voice left me praying for a good dose of pharyngitis. In short neither can sing or dance yet the Hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it is and people believe it. In short i wasted 2 hours, 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life. For our Australian summer releases it rates nearly as bad as Passengers.
Don't bother wasting the ticket money.""I would give it less than one if it wasn't for Del-Toro's part- which was the badass part. Other than that, usually I wouldn't write a review, but this movie annoyed me so much that i had to. No story whatsoever, The chick's part is a sexist chick's part, has no taste, has no meaning, only a waste of time and cigarettes. No action- maybe 50 shots fired, and maybe 10 people killed overall (nicely done by an Del-Toro). Other than that, I'd rather hear my grandma talk about knitting heart shapes on a green sweater, while watching the history channel on 3am. If it wasn't for the high rating and the awesome yet dull in this Del-Toro i would've never watched this movie or recommend anyone to ever watch it, ever. And ever and ever. I would rather count how many sheets of paper are in a paper towel. The movie is HIGHLY overrated on IMDb AND any other website you would see. Do yourself a favor, go mow the lawn or renew your library pass or something like that- you'd have more fun.""I have read other reviews, one in particular basically says that the movie wasn't meant to be gospel(the truth) but rather entertainment, I get that. However, the FACT that Heaven is real, God is real and Satan is real, regardless of whether or not YOU believe, makes it a serious matter to propagate the fables of the Catholic church and to trifle with the truth written in the word of God. There is a Satan, he is a fallen angel. Men do NOT become angels when they die. No amount of good deed will EVER win you a trip to heaven, in fact, if you count on your deeds to earn your way to heaven, you will be disappointed and find yourself in the place referred to as hell. That's right. Only Jesus can offer eternal salvation to those who accept Him and His death on the cross to pay for all sin. No amount of good deeds will make you MORE saved or less saved. But with ONLY good deeds, you WILL be lost forever UNLESS you repent. That is the ONLY message of the Bible. It isn't about punishing yourself for past sin, trust me, if you sinned, you punished yourself. There is always consequences for sin, some worse than others. Murderers are often judged and receive the death penalty, but even a murderer CAN and WILL be saved if he/she TRULY believes in Christs immaculate birth, righteous life and His own sacrificial death on the Cross. And add to that, His resurrection on the 3rd day. Yes, it is real, it is serious and making a movie DELIBERATELY PERVERTING the scripture is WRONG. Sorry, but the truth isn't always the way you wish it to be. Now you have heard the truth of the Gospel, now it is in YOUR hands to decide. No one can make a decision for you except you. We all must appear before God at the judgment. But if you receive Jesus as your personal savior(not a priest who is every bit the sinner as you and I happen to be), but go to the HIGHEST priest, Jesus, He and He alone forgives sin. Do NOT accept fables, believe the truth.""Will Ferrell is like Marmite, you either like him or you don't; I am of the latter persuasion, though I am guilty of enjoying Blades of Fury.
This film just didn't do anything for me, either as a comedy, thriller, or buddy-buddy action movie. Most of the better scenes were absent of Mr Ferrell. For me, the best parts of the movie was the ingenious opening sequence that created a fantastic satirical parody of every action movie filmed.
The other laugh-out-loud scene was when Will Ferrell's character, Allen Gamble, introduces his partner, Terry Hoitz (played well by Mark Wahlberg) to his wife Dr Sheila Gamble (nicely acted by Eva Mendes). This is a well thought out and well written bit of comedy, shame Will Ferrell was in it, his over-acting very nearly spoiled the piece.
If it wasn't for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Samual L Jackson, and Mark Wahlberg this would not be as good a Will Ferrell vehicle as it isn't.
If Mr Ferrell makes you laugh and puts a smile on your face then this movie is for you. Otherwise, just search for the two scenes I've rated and you'll have seen the best parts of the film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I had tried to see this movie again for years, remove it out of boredom. I'm wearing it again. How can a film of space popcorn be so slow? As there is always that Star Wars showdown, Star Trek, because I wanted to see both. But the truth has been a big disappointment. I do not see anything to this movie. It is clear that it is forty years old and the effects are not going to be of now and you will see that they fail and of course this one shows what is done in chrome, but that is the least of it. But I keep asking myself when the adventure is going to start and testosterone is going to jump.
The film is so special, that at one point two nurses enter the screen and go to the sick. In this movie everything is going slow.
The beginning of the film is like a trip to enjoy the ship, but who wants to delight with the ship? I do not like the costumes, they seem ugly and not appropriate for this type of cinema.
Photography is normal, neither good nor bad. But the direction, starting from that the film has a lack of total rhythm, there are many plans left in the beginning. The plans are not pretty.
I do not think the actors are all right. Neither good nor bad.
Personally, I stay with Star Wars""Somewhere along the line there must have been a fascination to see what would happen if cartoons were turned into live action films. That must be the reason we ended up with Popeye (with Robin Williams) and this take on 'The Flinstones' with John Goodman.
It's actually a successful attempt, and the film remains a regular fixture on TV. There are enough little nods to the cartoon, while a feasible story is being told.
Goodman is better as Fred than Moranis is as Barney, but there's enough sweetness to keep this film on track.
Nothing will top the cartoon, but this is an honest attempt.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Mr Hall, what were you thinking? So, let me get this straight. After a terrible holocaust in which a great number of the world's population perished, some people decided to go to great lengths to create and maintain an secretive, complex, difficult, costly, and GIGANTIC concrete maze with enormous moving walls and populated with gigantic malevolent monsters in order to . . . sorry. In order to test the brains of 2 dozen boys? Seriously? You couldn't think of an easier way to do it? Why not just test them in a lab? And why oh why, and this was never explained at any point . . . why create and then insert a bunch of hostile monsters to kill said boys? What would happen if these monsters killed ALL the boys? Pointless. Illogical. Self-defeating. Paper-thin. A. Complete. Waste. Of. Time.
Avoid at all costs.""Without a doubt this should be at the top of the most overrated movies of 2016. I cannot believe that I managed to stay awake during this trite story that goes absolutely nowhere. Not sure what message the director was trying to convey, but it utterly lost in the unbelievably slow pace and sleep inducing dialogue. Evidently this is supposed to be a story about a young, black man who is coming to terms with being gay in the gang/drug culture of Miami. Maybe that's a good story line, but it is impossible to relate to any of the characters due to the horribly boring writing. Definitely a movie to be missed. Borderline unwatchable and certainly not deserving of an Oscar nomination.""The story is very weak, the film seems like it was thrown together overnight. The plot was very weak, though there are some elements of good comedy. This film just seems like a cash cow to piggy back off Harry potter. All of the HP films were better than this. Think people voting this film way too high. The film is basically a wizard trying to find his pets whilst a terrorist wizard looks for some lame CGI obscurus. It doesn't even explain why hes looking for it. Yeah that's the whole film. Next to no story, just throws CGI creatures at us.
I would have liked to see more of a magical world and a stronger story. The main villain only had a few minutes of air time at the very start and at the end. (Probably due to the amount he charges) But I guess this was aimed at a very young audience who love CGI creatures that they've never seen in the HP universe. Like the dragon thing that increases or decreases in size to fit the space. But in the suitcase they stay very small not fitting the available space. I feel they could have made this film a lot better if they focused more on the story line. Also the teleporting gimmick is way too strong. No wizard could do this in previous Harry potter films which are much further in time in the HP universe. So wizard's got much weaker than those of 1920/30's?""Look, I never ever write reviews of movies and I won't here, however I have just finished watching ""Splice"" and am absolutely compelled to to plead with you, the movie-going public to take heed of the following dire warning. Watching this movie will cause you to severely question your judgment, that of your friends and family, of the movie industry in general, the movie theaters that ran it and the DVD company that pressed it. Furthermore, upon completion a good psychiatrist is required to avert suicidal tendencies and regardless, the Baker Act may have to be enforced.
I have to admit that I was leery of ""Splice"" from the start as 1.) I had never heard of it, have been around awhile and watch plenty of movies and 2.) A friend of mine said that he had a DVD from a friend of his, given to him to, ""Watch and then tell me what you think"". Hmm. So we dutifully watched, painfully endured and WOW are we sorry we did for now my friend has go go back to his friend and say what, ""You just played the joke of the century on me?!"" Throughout the entire movie I kept asking my friend, ""Your friend is toying with you, right? This is a joke, right?! What did you do to incur this kind of wrath?!!""
The entire enterprise is a complete disaster of the utmost proportions from start to finish and a rating of 0 would be far more appropriate. With just deplorable directing, absolutely thoughtless writing, God awful acting, nonexistent plot development, ridiculous pacing and the most offensively tasteless movie scene I have ever had the displeasure to witness, this bomb is of the anti-matter variety. As such, Vincenzo Natali and Antoinette Terry Bryant should be shamed into irrelevance, Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley should consider their Equity cards revoked for life and Michele Conroy should willingly relinquish her 2 Canadian editing awards. If only...
No spoilers here as the true spoiler was the movie itself. Other than to say that it is by far and above the most ridiculous use of time and money that I have ever seen AND a complete waste of celluloid, to engage in dissecting it in any way would only cause me to indulge in the second biggest waste of time of all time. Therefore I will attempt to move forward with some solace in that I have just witnessed the nadir of film making such that nothing, and I do mean NOTHING in the whole of life itself can be as shockingly deplorable as this total piece of garbage. Do yourself the biggest favor in the world and avoid ""Splice"" at all costs. Now where is my in-network Psychiatric directory.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The T-Virus has spread throughout the world as the third film in the series takes place in the barren post-apocalyptic desert. Alice (Milla Jovovich) has been cloned hundreds of time but the real Alice still wanders the wasteland fighting off scavengers, zombies, and mutated dogs. Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) still leads the experiments for the Umbrella Corp., which now operates underground away from the zombie plague. She teams up with a crew that includes some of the survivors from the previously film like L.J. (Omar Epps) and Carlos (Oded Fehr). Additional members include Claire, (Ali Larter), Betty (Ashanti), and Mikey (Christopher Egan).
Alice's powers have progressed more that she now has telepathic abilities, able to stop fire or other attacks with her mind. The zombies are nastier in this film as they now outnumber the humans by a greater ratio. Mutated beasts are still present from a return to the dogs to crows that have feasted on infected flesh and work together to attack the group. As Dr. Isaacs test Alice's fail, he becomes obsessed with capturing the real Alice and using her blood for further experimentation.

My only merits for this film are for the noble intentions of Nemo and his father, besides that, this is almost 2 hours of my life I won't get back, this film drags on so much that by the first hour I felt like I'd spent a full day watching it and on top of that I still had very little connection to the characters and their story hadn't even started. Second hour hit, still nothing, I was almost asleep. hahahaaha an octopus that is missing tentacles, not really. I might as well have been asleep, the story was still stagnant. As a sequel, it's like watching paint dry, it just doesn't get going. If you have the time to spare and have nothing better to do or watch then by all means, watch this film, but if you have something better do with your time then please, avoid this film. The length of the film doesn't justify the lack of story or the cinematic prowess, this could very easily have been a half hour short film. I can say none of us enjoyed much about this film. My bf thought it was empty and his employee thought it was strictly for children whereas the prequel was for children and adults. On the bright side we went home afterwards and had good satisfying sex until midnight so it was a good day.""New York, 1950s. Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer) are two youngsters in two rival gangs, the Sharks and Jets, respectively. They meet and fall in love. This will have fateful consequences.
Dull. I dislike musicals (though there are exceptions, Chicago and The Sound of Music being among them) and West Side Story is a great example of why. The overly theatrical acting, random musical detours, campy music and acting, style instead of substance, musical interludes instead of a good plot. Here the music actually detracts from the plot, as it is hard to imagine these being tough gang members when they are constantly singing and flamboyantly dancing around!
Watch or read the real deal, Romeo and Juliet, instead. To call this an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet does Shakespeare a massive injustice.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.
In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.
What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?
How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.
There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie was very hard to watch. The hectic pace and scatter-brained delivery of the ""Tulip"" character left both my wife and I occasionally wandering the online world looking for relief. The story line was cute, but all the jabber-jabber-jabber behavior. Frankly, speaking most especially of Tulip, any child of mine that acted with such disrespect toward others. We did like the character of Jasper played by Danny Trejo and liked the revenge of the small angry-birds, but the show just didn't rank with us. Lastly, we're supportive of homosexuals, but delivering a child via stork to lesbians? Storks deliver adopted children? There comes a point where representation is no longer valuable, and that scene felt more like indoctrinating children than including same-sex affection into mainstream presentation. But, I suppose that's the world we live in --- one where political inclusiveness appears more important than actually making a good story (or, at least, one in which the inclusion of the scene has anything to do with the movie at all).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie already starts out with the wrong foot, in a span of 20 minutes you are presented with a neglecting father that ( of course ) does not believe in the fantastical elements of the plot, an adventure hungry young man that ( of course ) is an introvert that everyone thinks is crazy and something no Hollywood movie seems to be complete without: A Holocaust reference.
This generic and boring feel of the first act would have been easier to forgive if it wasn't as long as it is, it just takes way too damn time for the main character to finally arrive at the place that bears the movie's name.
What follow then is a good half a hour exploration of this magical world which the movie should'a been all about, every single second of the trailer created for this movie come from scenes of this act, the children are genuinely interesting characters, the imagery is beautifully weird, in short, the midpoint delivers a little of what everyone was expecting from this movie.
Sadly, all goes downhill from there faster than a winter Olympics athlete.
Samuel L. Jackson shows up and in every single scene from this midpoint to the end, delivers nothing but terrible acting, horrible puns and a general sense that the supposedly life-or-death struggle being presented in the screen is a joke.
By the time of the climatic final fight, you will be face-palming at the utter stupidity of the antagonists, one dies from not looking both ways while crossing a street ( i wish i was making this up ), while Jackson is still cracking unfunny jokes at the children even after they killed virtually all of his henchmen.
This movie also suffers from schizophrenic rating syndrome, it has disgusting gore that no children under 12 would stomach seeing yet the villain is such an imbecile nobody over that same age would take him seriously.""Where to start ? Let's see the acting is terrible, plot is terrible, directing is terrible and cinematography terrible. With Viola Davis & Denzel Washington- this should have been better. What happened - ? First movie in quite a while that I was tempted to cut my losses and leave. I kept thinking this has to get better - possibly there is a point to the movie ?? Can't imagine anyone providing positive feedback, let alone actually enjoying this film. I am not the only one as the local theaters have it down to one showing per day. Should have built a FENCE around the theater to keep everyone away. Alas, save your money to watch another movie..."OK I'm not sure where to start.I'm an M. Night fan but this movie was not good at all.It took me 3 attempts just to get through the first 20 mins. After that i had to keep jumping forward in order to find a scene that wasn't drawn out or meaningless...Needless to say i never found that scene.Acting was below average and dialog wasn't much better.Very disappointed in M. Knight in this one..I don't know how someone with his kind of talent let this one slide by.Look forward to watching more of his work in the future.I have loved his work in the past and hope for his sake this doesn't set him back in creating his next project.Until than ill just watch his other films and skip over Split!"Terrible story line....changed out of nowhere and took me by surprise. Quickly it became a fast moving locomotive veering off the right track. The best acting I've seen though. However, the movie exaggerates and highlights the union of the wounded soul of many black men, and, the broken spirit of many black women, of which, was more prevalent throughout that era and the previous. The result is broken children forever struggling to know what true love is, and the meaning of true self respect. With so many good reviews, it is very interesting to see how people are dismissive and/or disregard the immorality of Denzel's character, especially in light of how he is seen for the first half of the movie to be seemingly in love with his wife. Almost as if he was bi- polar, his attitude in regards to his position in the family and responsibility seemed to have vanished. Actually, it was the bi-polar script which really was just not good, in my opinion. However, an Oscar and Emmy award are due to Denzel and Viola.""This film came five years ago, but I watched it now. A US-Russian collaboration product that's entirely takes place in Moscow. This is an alien invasion theme, but slightly different than those similar films. It never gives the reason, just the destructions like apocalypse on its way. That means it is about the survival. A group of Americans who are in the Moscow for different reasons joins the hands after people started to turn into ashes with the contact of the strange electric mist that came from the sky. So what's their plan now and whether they get out of it safely or not focused on the remaining film.
Surely some people would enjoy it. It's not all bad if you are not expecting a masterpiece. I should have seen it in digital 3D for a better experience, even the normal watch is not that bad. The turns in the story were unpredictable, particularly the film characters, but the twist wasn't. They kept the open ending, and you know why is that. I liked the performances, not individually, but the overall everyone, including the Russians.
The film was also shorter, which means fast moving tale. The graphics were okay, especially those electric mist thing, but disappointed for not show the aliens other than for fractions of seconds during the fightbacks. Despite enjoyed watching it, I'm not in favour of it, because it's just one of those films that falls in the average category where the majority of those who watched it not happy for not detailing everything in the film.
4/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Yes, this is another one of those movies where skinny armed girls fire high caliber weapons without suffering any kickback. The opening scene sets the silliness. Emily Blunt is a member of an assault team taking down a drug lords house. Blunt looks like Snoopy in his flight helmet, her tiny head overwhelmed by the armor. After the action, we slide fast into the ""knitted brow"" school of acting pioneered by knocked knee, flat footed superstar Leo DiCaprio; the knitting of the brow compensating for the lack of physical grace needed for a believable action star (Mitchum, McQueen, The Duke, Eastwood). Blunt can knit a brow along with the best but it just can't save this PC casting silliness.""This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen and I hate myself for seeing it. The four soldier leads are all just empty shells each with one dominant characteristic - we have the alpha one, the quiet one who tries to fit into a war dominated environment (and fails), the stereotypical beta character and the obvious soon-to-be-dead. The only female actor that has more than five minutes of screen time is a man and he is closeted, whose character doesn't seem to have two brain cells to rub together, and therefore correctly represents (in the eyes of those sad individuals who stand behind this piece of s**t of a movie)the entire male population. Ironically, he still manages to kill every German he meets because he's non-nazi. This movie is just bad and I would tell you to avoid it like the plague, but if you're anything like I am, all these bad reviews are probably just making you want to see it even more. Do so at your own peril.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""The Conjuring 2"" is the sequel to ""The Conjuring"", a pretty successful horror film from 2013. The director and one of the many writers here is once again James Wan, a Malaysian filmmaker who truly made it big in Hollywood. But the title of my review also refers to him and his career a bit. He worked on ""Saw, ""Insidious"", ""Conjuring"" and more horror films, so he is certainly one of the defining directors of the genre right now. But it seems as if he has sacrificed a great deal of creativity in case he ever had it. I personally was not a great fan of the first ""Conjuring"" movie and I am also not too big on this one here. The film itself is also where the title of my review applies. it is basically a summation of all kinds of elements used in all kinds of horror films in the past. Unseen danger. Very visible danger. Exorcist elements. Danger in the water. Children and women who get scared the hell out of them. Tough-ass male characters who want to fight he dark spirits at any cost etc. The two protagonists are played by Farmiga and Wilson as in the first film and this is basically another chapter to their profession. However, with Farmiga's character's reaction on some occasions, I truly wonder why she would work in a field like this and not do a quiet office job or so. Also the couple not only has to do with scary nuns and dead senior characters that take control of little girls, but they also have to deal with people who criticize their profession and say it's all nonsense, which also does not make any sense overall. So yeah, this film is really packed, but sadly it's like a 100 puzzle parts and almost none of them fit together or result in a convincing overall outcome. In one scene, Farmiga's character is scared to death, in the next it seems like nothing could scare her at all. How is that even possibly. The weakest moment was maybe the (seemingly) self-sacrifice scene of the male protagonist towards the end, which was pretty cringeworthy honestly. I see almost no really creative element in this film here, which sucks a lot and hurts the viewing experience too. This is especially painful as this movie runs for a massive 2 hours and 15 minutes almost, extremely long and you could actually see it as a mini-series in 3 parts of 45 minutes if you wanted. If you add the first movie, you almost have a real mini-series in terms of the length of both films taken together and if they ever make a third film, which they probably will looking at the success of the first two and how Wan loves sequels, then more will be added. As for me, this second film was already one too many, maybe even the first. The performances are also all very generic and bring nothing great to the screen, just like the script. Don't watch.""Home, go home.
Home has good animation, quirky characters, a very interracial movie, an original story, some funny moments (very few), and Rihanna and Steve Martin are quite natural and credible in their respective roles. A priori, the story has a good message: it tries to see the good things in humanity, speaks of what being a friend and being family feels like, and how important is keeping your word. I really liked that the Boovs change colour depending on their mood.
However, the characters are poorly developed, the story is not engaging enough for adults, too many clichéd twists and turns, and then there is the dubbing. I love Jim Parsons, but he is not good as Oh because, as soon as Oh opens his mouth, we hear Sheldom Cooper from The Big Bang Theory with all his quirks and voice inflections, not Oh, so that ruined the movie for me from the very beginning. This movie would have been great, it had good things a priori, but it ended being something all right.
This is an example of how a big production company can spend millions on animation to make a feature film and get nothing that will make you have a great time unless you are a small child, nothing that will make you lol, nothing that will touch your heart, nothing that will stay in your head for too long, nothing that will make you include the film in your fave list of animated films, and nothing that most animation lovers will find good or will be willing to see for a second time, even for free. I personally struggled keeping my attention when I first watched it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wanted to like, did not. 2/10.
Portrays American journalists as ignorant, lacking respect for other cultures, reckless and oblivious to the dangers of a region in conflict. I'm skeptical a news agency would deploy a reporter with no briefing whatsoever and the USMC would allow embedded correspondents off leash in a firefight as depicted in the film.
Somewhere in the middle of the film the comedy subsided, Billy Bob got promoted from Col to (B?)Gen and Fey learns expletives in the local language. Neither of the latter developments are on screen.
The inclusion of a PG rated sex scene was unnecessary. If the film requires a sex scene show the sex, not weird foreplay followed by a jagged cut to the stereotypical lady full of regret morning after. Just skip it if the leads don't want to get naked.
The alt-rock soundtrack didn't fit the subject matter particularly well. Also sick of 'Jump Around' in movies. Find a new song already.
Minimal character development. Maybe 1.5 characters we actually care about, the rest are filler. Some guy died as a result of a drone strike. Another took shrapnel to the eye. I guess it was the other news crew thus nominal plot impact. The attack itself was poorly executed. Showing the ops guys lining up the target before the strike spoiled the moment. Sucked all the drama and horror out of it. Oh boy here it comes!!! Missile!!! BOOOM!!! Limbs everywhere. USA is dominate!
A Nice Marine got his legs blown off by an IED. Heard about it from a competitive reporter (Robbie) laying a guilt trip on Fey. Again, no emotional investment. The film wraps up with Fey visiting The Nice Marine back in the US. No anger, no blame. Just a happy ex-Marine with his cute wife, child, modest home and no legs. Good job movie. Battleship (2012), for all its faults, at least portrayed the double amputee Army vet Mick Canales as angry with the world for the loss of his legs. Reality is somewhere in between most likely but I just don't see a Marine having an ""it's all good"" attitude so soon after his loss.
The script took a couple of cheap shots against the USMC and US Army. Not a ra-ra military guy but I could see veterans being put off by the dialog. If the jokes had been funny it might have worked.
The one dimensional representation of Afghanistan seems to the product of uninspired screen writing. It paints a bleak picture of the culture. No happiness, no kindness whatsoever. Perhaps it really is that way? It's not clear who or what the antagonist is. The conflict? The culture? The Americans? The boss back in NYC? Boredom? Weak story overall. No tension. No real drama. Just a reporter abroad with no clue who or what she is dealing with. It was implied boredom is a first world problem. Perhaps it is. Not sure the solution is to be useless in Afgahnistan.
I will give the film points for not including a gratuitous rape scene. I expected it and was pleasantly surprised it didn't happen.
The movie could have been interesting if it wasn't a trying to envelope the horrors of war in a chick flick with Superbad-eque tendencies.
With work Fey could be a decent dramatic actor if she lets go of the need to inject SNLisms every line of dialog.
As a satire Whiskey Tango Foxtrot pales in comparison to Starship Troopers. The film attempts to be serious and as a result its message and impact is lost.
Interesting premise. Lousy script. Passable acting. Mediocre action. Rent once and forget.""This film is a well made (hey, it's Hitchcock) but heavy-handed piece of misogyny in which the title character is repeatedly told that her ""husband"" (who blackmails her into marrying him, then apparently thinks he's doing her a favor by raping her) must take over her life and tell her what to do, what she thinks, and how she feels; otherwise, she can never escape her horrific past. The psychology is simplistic, and every bit of ""help"" Mark (Sean Connery) offers Marnie (Tippi Hedren) is forced on her, often brutally. The worst part, though, is at the very end, where the childhood trauma that led Marnie to a life of crime is revealed and, incredibly, Marnie's mother (Louise Latham) is said to have emotionally abused her daughter for decades because she ""loves"" her. It's hard to like any of the characters, though Marnie herself earns some sympathy because of her lifelong victimization.""I really enjoy the part 1.. It makes me keep wanting to watch over and over again.. But for this 'Rise of an Empire' its totally twisted the fact and lots of loop holes in the story.. Lots of corny before battle speeches that makes me sleepy, overuse of slow motion effects,killings that makes no sense.. I really regret watching this. The greatness and inspiring 300 in my mind is ruined.. If you are going to watch this movie seriously and expect it to be as good as part 1 then trust me you are wrong. I don't even recognize this as 300 part 2.. It's just a lame movie trying to imitate 300 legacy and fail miserably. The high ratings obviously more than half are fakes.. Just go read those positive reviews.. So much loopholes. They can name the crews, actors and actress so well like a book. Wow.. And i saw one of them prompting people to buy DVDs when out. So obvious they are insiders that came here to make fake votes and reviews.. I dun even know the names of the actors and actress so well.. Hey.. Stop cheating yourselves that this was a successful movie. It is not at all..""Of all the war dramas that I have seen over the years, (Saving Private Ryan, Tora Tora Tora, Fury) this movie is by far the worst I have seen. Even the name makes me angry. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, or if you only read the capitalized letters, WTF. People were killed in the conflict in Afghanistan and this is the best they come up with!? Frankly it is insulting to both the military and to journalism in war zones. Granted Margot Robbie and Martin Freeman did some decent acting, I can't get over the fact that Tina Fey was chosen for the leading role. She is a known SNL crony who helps push their liberal agenda on an unsuspecting populace. She couldn't even try to take her role seriously, always acting like a clueless news reporter wannabe who wants to make a name for herself. And yet a full quarter of the movie was about a bunch of reporters from all over the globe getting together in Afghanistan spending their nights drinking, partying, and shagging each other.
You know what, I take it back. This was a low point for both Robbie and Freeman. Her role in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and his ongoing role in the PBS ""Sherlock"" series did not deserve any of this being in this train wreck. The entire movie told me that journalists were a bunch of horny, boozing party animals who don't understand what is going on around them until a missile explodes in their face and one of their friends dies, but as long as their boss gives them a raise and a place on the evening news then I guess it's okay as long as nothing bad happens to them.
Just don't watch this movie at all. It will be another name in a long, sad list of obscure Hollywood movie titles.""This film was recommended to me as a groundbreaking, trendsetting, example of horror film unlike anything I had ever seen. And it is unlike anything I had ever seen in that I don't think I have ever seen a more uninteresting and boring film. The shock value is there, there is no denying that the movie goes for the throat so to speak, with regards to trying way too hard to evoke visceral reactions from the viewer with gratuitous representations of morbidity and depravity. However the production is so poor that mostly it comes across as having the same level of production value as a high school musical. The practical effects are weak, and in the 70's nudity was far from being scandalous whereas now it is just downright tame. The ideas presented in the film are convoluted and a little bit ridiculous. Meandering monologues of old men speaking directly into the camera and shaky camera work throughout the film make it difficult to watch and take seriously despite the grave nature of the subject matter. If you handle boredom well and have a stomach for unsophisticated juvenile political ideals then maybe this outdated eye vomit will be tolerable and entertaining.
I found reading the reviews here to be far more entertaining and interesting than the movie itself""Did ANY producers read the script before giving it their thumbs up? Was the audience at the test screen high? Were Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Jason Sudeikis so utterly broke that they had no choice but to do this movie? Who are the scree writers? I don't mean ""who are they"" as in ""what are their names?"". I mean what kind of people write this trash and manage to maintain some semblance of self respect? Please, don't make the mistake I did of watching it. Just say ""no"". Don't even watch the trailer. If You are still reading this, you have wasted too much time on this disaster.""Hi folks.
Don't even bother with this one.
Possibly one of the worst films ever made! The remake of ROBOCOP was ten times worse than the excellent original, and CHAPPIE is a hundred times worst than that! As for his scientist inventor, and also the rival workmate, well the least said the better.
The acting is appalling. Even Sigoury Weaver is a joke. And the script is laughable. It is definitely not a thriller.
As I say, they should have left automated-policing to the original ROBOCOP.
A complete waste of time any money.
Hope this helps . . .
Best.

Sometime late 2016, I happened across a trailer for this strange looking film starring Colin Farrell. At its very basic, it is the story of a guy who goes to a hotel and he must find love in 45 days or he will be transformed into the animal of his choice...in this case, a lobster. It was very strange and the trailer implied that it would be comedy of sorts (Dark humor, maybe?) set in a world similar to ours but yet very different. I missed it when it came out in theaters and I have only just watched it via Red Box.
There was one glaring question as I watched this film and after it was done: how did this film get all this praise (3rd place at Cannes, and nominated for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards)?
To hear/read the accolades and to listen to the cast and crew reminisce on how beautiful and thought provoking this film was...made me wonder if I am just not in tune with ""true art"". Maybe my rational brain is incapable of absorbing the nuances of the director's soft yet firm take on the love story. Yes, this supposedly a love story set to a dystopian dark comedy. A dark comedy it is not, not even the slightest snicker even dared to pass my lips the entire film. What did pass my lips was either a yawn or a demand for the film to ""get on with it!"" and stop dragging it's feet.
Here is the main problem: the majority of the film possessed absolutely zero emotion. The only time anyone even gave a hint of human emotion was when something painful/traumatizing occurred to a character. The rest of the time they spoke like Ben Stien after taking too many depressants. The actors said that if they gave any emotion it would detract from the beauty of the script...I'm sorry, when Shyamalan characters have more natural sounding dialogue than you then there is a serious problem. It also doesn't help that the majority of the cast don't speak English as a primary language...or that this is the first English language film by this director!
And what about the love story? It is more a story about what is love or how you know you are in love. In this film and the setting...love is finding someone who has a similar distinguishing characteristic to you regardless of true feelings. You have a limp, I have a limp...we are a perfect match! Yes, the ""love"" in this film is that absurd (not funny absurd, just depressingly sad absurd). And then you have the two societies in this film: the couples and the loners. The couples are the general population that forces everyone to strive toward partnership regardless of actual feelings. Concepts like individualism are oppressed and family is simply a product to help combat partner conflict. The loners are the ones living free in the woods to be individuals individuals that must live by the group's rules or suffer terrifying punishment on par with what the couples do.
The film is absurd to the core. The characters are not at all realistic. The absurd dystopian society exists without rhyme or reason. The plot aimlessly drags on forever. And the ambiguously sudden ending left me shouting ""Thank God It's Over!"" rather than ""No! I want to know what happened!""
If you must see it, rent it for find a free copy. Spend as little money as you can on this ""film.""
I give this film one steaming red lobster....straight into the trash can.""Criminal is another under the radar action, sci-fi drama that flopped at the box office and has been somewhat forgettable from last year. The main concept is not enough to sink Criminal. But throw in an incompetent CIA station chief (Gary Oldman); a series of CIA operatives who do irrational activity,getting many of them killed; a truly unbelievable and often idiotic villain (Jordi Molla).
The film has a decent concept but feels underdeveloped and when we reach the end, it feels as it they could have done a lot more. Some parts were entertaining and intriguing but thinking of the film as a whole, it was not too great and somewhat messy and confusing. Low expectations were what was had, and it fell through. The ending was too predictable in a whole. Pretty blatant that was how it was going to end. This is a film which could have used some unexpected twists and turns, it surely would have made the film better. But what we were left off with, was another unpredictable and under developed forgettable action crime film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is just gross. I'm sorry for anyone who watched this and enjoyed it.
I'm not adverse to graphic content. I'm not adverse to sex or violence in movies at all but the way it's executed in this film is so distasteful.
The plot could be interesting; an ex-pornstar is offered a huge amount of money to make one last film which he is given no knowledge of but he does so to provide for his family and lift them out of poverty. However the film turns out to be a snuff film with pedophilia and necrophilia.
The problem I have with this film is it's dressed up as a commentary on Serbian politics and the situation in Serbia (at least that's what I gleaned from the dialogue). Not gonna comment on the validity of the comments the film made but I'm arguing that these comments are not delivered in an intelligent or worthwhile manner. Any commentary I got was just spewed by the character of Vukmir in his conversations with Milos. None of it (to my knowledge) was delivered through clever symbolism and everything to do with the snuff film just served as a ""omg look how brutal this is"" but after a while you just become desensitised to it all.
The film literally is just shoving shocking imagery in your face for a reaction and then lazily slapping a commentary on it. As a result, the movie is not fun to watch which is my main complaint. I can enjoy sick twisted imagery and plots but this movie just gave me a kinda empty, sick feeling while watching it. I wasn't invested in the characters or the story so all that was left that the movie could sell you was it's violence and brutality. To me, that felt so cheap and I finished this movie with a sour taste in my mouth because I felt like this was just wanting to be a snuff film while shoving some pretentious politics in there to make it seem like more than the cheap, disgusting farce that it is.
On the upside, it was at least technically well-made and acted decently even though I feel genuinely sorry for any actor who had to partake in filming this disgusting script.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There will be big spoilers in this review, but given how awful this movie is, you'll probably be thankful you didn't waste your time watching it to find out for yourself. I was looking for movies about writers and figured what the hey. Well, let me tell you: this movie sucks!!! Firstly, the writer gets hired to finish a book another writer was writing when he died. This implies the book was not finished, however, the manuscript is complete so very early in the movie it's clear that the movie makes no sense. If a manuscript is finished you need an editor, not a writer.
When all signs point to the first writer being murdered, what does new writer do? Follow in the footsteps of dead writer, narrowly escaping his own death by not hiding at all from the hit men, then call a random number he found among the effects of dead writer. It just so happens that the person whose phone that is wants to save him.
Writer talks about his suspicions with all the people who obviously had something to do with the initial writer's supposed murder, except they don't murder him.
And the biggest spoiler and let down: he finds out the big secret in the end and guess what, he just happens to walk into the street and get hit by a car, so nobody ever finds out what he knew. Like, seriously.
To top it off, the sound is terrible. Talking is at a level 2 while all sound effects are at a level 15.
What crap.""Shamalayan follows the footsteps of Spielberg as the two are really into delivering a story: for sure, this movie has a really mysterious one that catches the attention of the audience. However Shamalayan has not his skills as this movie just crumbles unto itself with its boring, endless dull scenes and terrible lack of pace! We have left with some beautiful Gothic American pastoral landscape (as seen in the movie parodied in my title), a few really tense moment but most of the time, i have been bored and used my remote control to give first aid to this comatose movie! It's funny to notice that in 2017 i just kept watching Hurt in movies and that Phoenix is still unable to give us a character with passion!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I really can't understand how films like this are so well received & praised! I mean, there was little to no action in it. 3/4 of the film was just the couple bobbing up & down in the sea bitching at one another & finally the ending just came & that was it!
The film premise is basic & short. A couple get forgotten about while scuba diving out at sea, they're trapped & far away from land & are in a sink or swim situation (literally). And that's it.
There is some action in it, but 'very' little & that's of sharks swimming about around the couple. It's simply typical, as me hating this film in the eyes of someone else who watched & liked this bore of a film, would probably criticise me for being all action fan boy who only cares about blood, explosions & profanity! Then judging me because this film doesn't use clichés & somehow is self explanatory, very similar to that of The Blair Witch Project which like this film was an outright bore!
Well, yeah, I mean it's a film & a film 'has' to be entertaining! Whats the point otherwise if there's f**k all action in a film, that it can be called so much as good or remotely entertaining!
It's funny because the tagline for this film is ""Jaws meets Blair Witch"" which I find to be quite funny in a way because that's what this film is like, well 3/4 of the film is Blair Witch & only 1/4 is Jaws! It has the b!tchy, annoying, boring, crappy, short arse-ness which is that of The Blair Witch Project & only has a very minuscule bit of action which is that of Jaws! If it had the action of Jaws this film would've been better & far more enjoyable, yet it just had to be over used on the boring Blair Witch formula!
It really sucked! It was more like Blair Witch meets Jaws minus the action sequences! It's funny really, how people who liked this crappy film go on about how it's like being in a real situation & that it's a the true fear that makes it great when hilariously enough, we're behind a screen & the novelty of that crap is gone within seconds since it came in. You need more than just fear, especially when it's a film & people want entertainment! In other words people who are faint hearted & actually get scared 'really' easily would like this, but I myself wasn't scared & we as humans can't truly feel scared unless we're actually in that situation! It's near enough impossible, so the novelty is worn quickly & the film just drags on with no action in it! They had to take the non-cliché route & balls up a film which could've had potential! Even for a short film, it felt long & boring! Not to mention as annoying as The Blair Witch Project which sucked hard!
I overall hated this film! It is really bad! Don't watch! 1/10""If you haven't seen any good Shark movie yet , then i reckon you may going to enjoy this film , but if you've watched plenty movies like this genre before, then you will not see any new impressive ideas ,and absolutely , it's a waste of time ,there were scenes that make no sense at all like the foolishness of 'nancy' character ,'blake lovely' i'd like to ask the scenarist , Is it really meant to be like this? .
I believe the movie's earnings were much more than it deserved , maybe because the people expected a neoteric shark film ideas ,and frankly 'Anthony Jaswinski' hasn't done any previous work that deserves any critic's compliment , therefore i guess all these high rates was because of 'Blake Lively' fans , and to tell the truth she did astonishing job in this film when she played the dramatic role as Nancy . The four stars i gave to this film were for the music guy who made the exciting atmosphere more than the story itself ,and for the two listens i benefited from it, the first one is knowledge utility appears when you fall in trouble , the second is what you say might come true and it doesn't have to be Christmas ,lol 'Karma' . finally if you're a Mexican you might find it somewhat offensive because of some of Mexican characters who meant to be imbecile. Thank you .""A truly horrible movie, in my own opinion.
MY wife and I saw a preview for this movie and thought it would be funny, based on the preview. We saw this opening weekend and simply had a bad movie experience. The movie drones on and on. After two hours, my wife (who is a really nice person), leaned over and whispered to me ""Can we leave now? This isn't worth staying any longer for."" I made her stay to finish it and the first words to enter my mind once it completed was ""Thank Goodness I can go home now.""
Just wait for Netflix and watch it there if you really want to see this movie.""Underworld: Blood Wars (2016) Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Theo James, Lara Pulver, Tobias Menzies, Charles Dance, Bradley James, Daisy Head, Oliver Stark, Eva Larvoire, Alicia Vela-Bailey, India Eisley, Trent Garrett, David Bowles, and Brian Caspe Directed By: Anna Foerster Review PROTECT THE BLOODLINE It's January 2017! You know what that means, more shitty horror movies! But hey this is a guilty pleasure of mine, I love the first three underworld movies, they're great films in my opinion but Awakening was an unnecessary pile of trash. They should have ended it with the prequel Rise of The Lycans. As we once again get a prologue to past events from the other four movies (much like those even worse Resident Evil Movies which doesn't even have one good film under there belt) we find Selene as an outcast being hunted down by a new Lycan leader Marius, who is looking for Selene's daughter which they don't even say her name if she even has one. He wants her blood because she's pure-blood which would make him and anyone else who drank it really powerful. The film is very short if it weren't for the fact that I liked Selene I would have forgotten I saw this movie. This one doesn't feel as cool as the last one (and the last one was awful but you could still have a good time) that would be the pacing's fault it feels so rushed that it almost wants to get it over and it has the same run time as Rise of The Lycans and that ones great. However with that being said you know what your getting when you see the trailers and the fact that it's a horror movie in January. Your getting an awful film that can be enjoyed and while it was a poorly made film I thought it was fine. This isn't my favorite in the series not even in the top three of course. But if you want to just have fun in the movies and you like horror (like I do) then go see it if you so wish. I'm giving Underworld: Blood Wars a two out of five.""Now, I'm familiar with the first two films, but I'll be honest, all that I can remember well is Kate Beckinsale in tightly cladded, black leather, looking like a hotter CatWoman, but in fact, she's a blood sucking bat woman. I didn't even know there was another two films! Rise of Lycans that was without Beckinsale (that might have something to do with it) and Awakening which did have Beckinsale.
TV director and cinematographer, Anna Foerster makes this her big screen debut, but it's not a good start. It's not horrendous and is properly a good opportunity out of a bad situation, however this unfortunately puts doubts in my mind about her Source Code 2 that's in currently in development.
I'm not sure what I missed but there appears to be a lot of back stabbing, characters defecting or returning for redemption. For someone who has skipped the previous two, it didn't really make much sense with the flashbacks but it's not really hard to figure out and follow.
It's unfortunately a messy and poorly scripted story, drowning in borrowed elements from other films, making it awfully predictable where it tries to be clever. One scene in particular immediately reminded me the battle at Helm's Deep in LotRs Two Towers. It's very rushed and it progresses faster than their superhuman healing powers. One minute they're on a train, then they're riding horses across a snow plain to all of sudden scaling a cliffside. Just seemed utterly pointless and stupid. There are characters and story elements that get introduced but are quickly pushed to one side to make way for more plot lines or twists, the side characters especially are not developed enough.
Beckinsale fits into her right leather comfortably but she isn't in the film as much as I was expecting, giving some of the story to Theo James' David. Again, because of this rushed though balanced storyline, you never feel like you're getting the full picture and being a fan of James, I believe he's capable of giving so much more. I want to see how he does on the frontline, they should give him a superhero tryout.
The action was as expected, decent enough to be entertaining but the bullet dodging makes it borderline spoof; and what's with all the grunting during the dramatic stand off scenes!? David grunts cuts to Marius grunting back, David grunts some more, Marius I think sighs and grunts at the same time, only more intense. This goes on for what feels like a good thirty seconds!
I didn't feel anything with the bad guys, in fact, I felt little for any of the characters. Marius, played by Tobias Menzies, wasn't really bad enough, don't know what to make of him. And Lara Pulver's Semira just appeared to be a cheap version of most of Eva Green's nasties.
I can't speak for the previous sequels but the first film boasted a decent soundtrack with tracks from Bowie, A Perfect Circle and Amy Lee from Evanescence, something that's the expected from this sub-genre of movies. Michael Wandmacher composes a fitting score but nothing memorable, and all sounds very much the same throughout.
It appears I don't have anything good to say about this movie, however, if I was of a younger generation of movie-goer, I might enjoy this as a brainless action fantasy flick. But I ended up laughing at a lot of it, especially the bullet dodging. It's not worthy of the big ticket price and it really doesn't urge me to watch the rest of franchise.

34% 3/10""I normally don't review movies, but I just had to take a few minutes to warn everyone not to go near this trash. I only started watching it solely because I'm a fan of Josh Peck and grew up watching Drake and Josh on Nick. This is not even a movie. There is literally NO PLOT! It looks like it is just a cameraman chasing around random people committing crimes and drug deals. They label it as a ""comedy"" but I didn't even get close to laughing once. The language is very vulgar and inappropriate, containing hundreds of pointless F bombs and frequently references pornography. Not to mention the first 10 minutes of the movie or so ends up repeating itself later on (they literally show the same footage twice). I'm pretty sure you'd have to be high while watching this to even get remotely close to enjoying it. Don't even bother as this crap was 80 minutes of my life I'll never get back.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Remember the story of the king who got ripped off by the tailor who said he had ""An expensive, exquisite material"" that ONLY INTELLIGENT people could see? The king, not wanting to appear stupid, paid dearly for his new robes. The story spread through the town, and when the townspeople saw their king marching naked, THEY did not want to appear stupid, and all admired him. Until a little child pointed at the king and cried""He's NAKED!"" The child's honesty made everyone, including the king, realize they'd been tricked by their own EGOS. The people who are writing these GLORIOUS reviews-what are YOU on? I'd like some. if you're a parent and your teenager or a little older says they liked this, you failed in film education. I know today's kids don't like black and white films(that breaks my heart) but if YOURS do, start with ""The Day The Earth Stood Still""-the original, not the Keanu Reeves yawnfest. Believe it or not Charlie Sheen made a great movie called ""The Arrival"" and it was a great movie-we thought this boring, pretentious bore was a remake. Sadly, no. Close Encounters of The Third Kind is still the gold standard.""Fire In The Sky"", a supposedly true story(they convinced ME, scary stuff!) E..T.,for gods sake, had heart, humor, tears, and believability. Show THESE to your kids, or better yet, watch WITH them, and remember what Hollywood COULD do. A lot of people talk about ""Independence Day"", but it was SO disappointing, one minute serious, the next minute, childish humor. And the original ""War of the Worlds"" - the Tom Cruise remake was pretty frightening too, but a little too much of the screaming little girl and disgruntled son. This movie was SO BAD, I had to take an ADDERAL to stay awake, and I NEVER fall asleep at the movies. There's NOTHING HERE, folks, no matter WHAT the king says he's wearing. I read 13 pages of the reviews here, and the ones who gave it a good rating were AS BORING AS THIS MOVIE. ""Look how intelligent I am, I really understood what the message was. I could be the next Elbert!"" Uh, no, no, and DEFINITELY NO. I sure do wish Roger were here, he would have warned me. If you really feel you must see it, WAIT UNTIL ITS ON T.V. AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.(And time, because you'll turn it off, pretty darn quick.) I wish I could have. Linda😀💩💩👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻""Feel like making a few extra billion dollars without using any effort? Well, you're in luck! Here's my 20 simple steps on making a Marvel movie:
1. Start with fight scenes
2. Find as many random comic book references as possible and cram them into the ""story""
3. Add as many characters into the ""plot"" even if it becomes way too crowded
4. Add fight scenes
5. Make the dialog lol-tastic and quirky playful banter, despite being a ""dark"" movie
6. Oh wait, the movie is dark again, be sure to make the film go into dramatic mode, where there are no sound effects except for echoed ""NOOO!""'s and the swelling music
7. Add fight scenes
8. Throw in a few random chuckle-worthy lines. Make sure the music stops when this happens, letting the audience know that something funny is being said
9. Make the editing schizophrenic and impossible to see anything, especially during the fight scenes. This ensures that viewers cant see anything that's going on during all 5,932 action scenes
10. More fight scenes, plus explosions
11. More comic book references
12. Make it at least 140 minutes in runtime to make it seem more epic
13. Add in yet more characters, this time for the sake of making more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will...
14. Make the directing as obvious as possible, thus eliminating all suspense or deeper thinking. Remember, your audience is stupid and only want explosions...
15. Add more explosions to more fight scenes
16. Make the villain a goofy wise ass who exchanges quirky banter with the characters instead of making it him/her an intimidating foe
17. Throw in a random love arc. DRAMA
18. Tell your composer to write the most bland score ever
19. Whatever comic book references and characters you have left, no matter how small or pointless, THROW THEM INTO THE SCRIPT! Just dump the entire bucket into the pool!
20. Finish with more fight scenes.
There! In just 20 brief steps, you'll make a guaranteed billion dollars. If you're a DC executive wondering how to make BvS2 or Justice League reach that big B, just follow this list and you'll be rolling in the green in no time. No need to worry about a story, plot, or screenplay, because that crap takes too much time. Instead, just follow my list to become the next Warren Buffett of quickly-aging cinema. Best of luck to you, gents!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I love this series BUT the scriptwriters are making the plots pitiful. Selene is becoming more predictable and considering she's the #1 Lycan Killer she's showing a soft side. I would recommend seeing this ONLY IF you're an avid fan but DON'T pay full price!
Good: Selene continues to show skills and gets some new ones.
Continuity of characters.
Storyline remains consistent.
Bad: Compacting too much of the story-line just too keep action
flowing.
Inconsistent displays of vampire strength and powers.
Ease of vampire gullibility
At least we can expect at least one more film to give them a chance to bring it up to par, sigh...""This movie was produced, written, played and directed by the same man, an actor who believes he should become a genius of cinema if he wants to respect himself. It is a bundle of stereotypes, anachronisms, bad acting and excess of dialogue and ""ideas"". I wanted to walk out one hour into the film, but I was with someone. If the above said were not enough, the crap lasts 130 minutes of unbearable boredom. By the way, I loved the Cuban music played in that Florida party; the movie makers imply this is about 1930 but the orchestra sounds like Gloria Stefan's songs, those guys were 70 years ahead of their time! *Wonderful*! And this gross inaccuracy is a strong characteristic of the film, as every possible approach to all possible events of the late twenties/early thirties (they only forgot to cleverly link the plot to Lindbergh's kidnapping) is seen through the lens of the nice opinions of today. This is therefore probably the fakest thirties you can see on a screen. I also want to underline the utterly stupid and worthless ""morals"" of the story, as it is plain from start that the badass played by Affleck is not better than the guys he fights & kills, and some of his actions are particularly disgusting and vicious. You want a proof? There's no way you can feel you care a speck of dust about any character in the film, save for maybe some of the victims of the tough guy. A recital of viciousness which tries to lecture us on morals. Unpalatable. I agree with almost all user reviews between 4 and 1. What you read in those reviews is the best that can be said about this film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The video game adaptation sparks a franchise that has soldiered for five sequels. The first film begins with the hive of the Umbrella Corp under a lockdown as a virus spreads through the facility. Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up with a blurry memory inside a mansion. She encounters Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be part of the police force when they are captured by a military team. The leader of the team is One (Colin Salmon) who is taking them from the mansion deep underground to stop the evil rogue AI, the Red Queen, beneath Raccoon City.
Alice also has memories of being married to Spence (James Purefoy). She teams up with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) after most of the team is eliminated by a laser beam hallway. The movie turns into a typical zombie movie from that point on with cheap special effects and over the top action common for a movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. Audiences have been spoiled with zombie gore since this film was released and this is nowhere near one of the top in this subgenre of horror. The special effects are pretty flimsy and dated too.
Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com""This really is shockingly bad and lazy. It had the potential to be interesting and it's own film, yet cops out with incredibly lazy writing that relies on the viewers knowledge of the JC version to fill in the blanks or make allowances for the amazing speed that the heroine connects all the dots.
Stuff happens for happening sake or to look cool/gross out but doesn't advance or contribute to the story. At some points they try to make their own film, yet in others blatantly copy scenes and imitated shots from the JC version.
To some extent I'm not sure if this new version is trying to emulate the alien by offering us a dodgy copy of the JC version that although tries to look the same is simply a lame, bogus and empty imitation.
I've literally just fast forwarded through the last 40 minutes because it was so awful I didn't want it corrupting the kudos of the JC version.
What a cheap, nasty, lazy tie in. The studio should be ashamed of themselves for so shamelessly exploiting the reputation of one of their classics for such a grubby, undeserving piece of crap.""The opening scene is promising. It's a group of criminals that you find out are police officers are plotting to commit a difficult armed robbery. They decide that in spite of the odds they will go through with the plan. And what you eventually find out is that this film is just all about a group of characters who must obtain a McGuffin, no more no less.
We then meet the woman who is calling the shots. The gritty film becomes laughable from there. Kate Winslet, looking nasty and wearing a gold Star of David pendant at least as large as a hockey puck is introduced, right after her two non-speaking thugs with cool haircuts and huge skull cap yarmulkas escort our black protagonist into the house. His half black son is being raised Jewish and also has a huge skull cap yarmulka on his head. Apparently all of this Russian mob also is connected with Israel. What did this have to do with the movie at all? At that point I could only wonder whether the film received financing from a middle east arab country or someone with a HUGE ax to grind with religious Jewish people and Israel. And that theme continues throughout the movie and right up front.
There is nothing new as you move along. It's the same heavy handed message that there is no honor among thieves and criminals. I won't give away the ending. It's no big reveal you'll guess part of the explosive climax which doesn't make much sense if the characters are consistent with how they are presented.
This is such a colossal waste of talent. A cast whose names are on some of the most well known and revered films of the past decade and the end result will only be memorable for how far out of the way the director goes to remind everyone that the most horrible criminal animals in this film are these reviled religious Jewish Israeli mobsters. Forgettable rubbish.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First of all I'm surprised that there's a sequel to 'Now You See Me' in the first place. The first film was a classy new take on the heist movie, but I certainly didn't think it needed a sequel.
But Hollywood obviously dictated that it did,so nearly all of the original cast reunite for this rather silly follow-up that isn't nearly as good.
It all starts well, but soon we're on a pointless jaunt around the world, with some poor dialogue and ridiculous plot points along the way. The minute Woody Harrelson ends up playing his twin I knew the game was up and that this sequel would join a long line of 'weaker than original' cash ins. It's a shame really, because this has a talented cast, who seemed game to make this a hit.
The absence of Isla Fisher divides fans, some missed her, some didn't. I thought that while Lizzy Caplan brought something different to the role of female horseman, it didn't really work.
A real mess of a film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Man I have seen a lot of awful movies and normally I won't comment on them on the internet. But this one! This movie wasn't bad because it was bad, which caused me to write a review about it! No it was just so bad that it left me so flabbergasted wondering how the hell could this have made so much money!
To be honest I always had a dislike for Star Wars. The weird creatures, the stupid costumes and the inkling thought that its popular but simplistic good vs bad plot, may have been a factor in causing the American people to support the 2002 Iraq war blindly, have made me always steer away from watching it. But the sheer amount of merchandise, trivia, commercials for reboots, web pages etc. Had caused me some doubt. Maybe I should see them first before disliking them! I once read that there were more web pages about Star Wars than there was about WWII, maybe there was a good reason for it, maybe the originals were really that good!
When I finally began to watch: cringe set in, followed by annoyance followed by sleepiness followed by a same loss of faith in mankind as when you watch a documentary on genocide, when the UN pretends to be an effective organization in maintaining world peace, or when your school indoctrinates your children with state propaganda while making them double think that free speech and individual rights have no flaws or boundaries. I will tell you why 1: There was no character or plot introduction, not even a simple save the cat or kill the dog plot device (like in House of Cards) to make you connect with the characters. Instead it was boom two lego ships firing some lasers peeuw peeuw. 2: The worst, cheesiest and most infantile lines and dialogues I have ever heard. 3:The worst acting ever (except from Harisson Ford ) even for 70's standards people die and there are no emotions. especially the main characters was incredibly annoying. 4: Really inane science fiction that makes you scratch your head all the time and make you wonder, would a woman still cook in the kitchen or a man work when there are robots around? 5: The golden rule 'show don't tell' is ignored here and instead we have characters saying everything they think or even explain you things. 6:Enormous amounts of plot holes and things happening because the script demands it. Such as that scene on the deathstar when a stormtrooper releases the robots for a very weak excuse in order for them to save the protagonists. Or when Obi wan let's himself get killed for no apparent reason. 7: The lack of a plot and character development except rebels are good empire is evil, empire needs to be fought and some lame half explained quest of whinebaby to become a jedi. 8: The worst antagonists in movie history ever. Those stormtroopers and imperial commanders are so dumb and inefficient. that with all probability some football hooligans high on speed and armed with bats and pocket knifes could slay millions of them despite their laser technology. with which they can't aim anyway. The most obvious solution to imperials is to keep up blowing up planets till the rebels surrender, but hey then you don't have a lame plot about a teenager saving the day. And what's with the really lame clothing references to the German Wehrmacht come on, we know they are evil we don't need another comparison with the Nazi's. 9: Really bad sesame street costumes, kitschy plastic looking armor and sets, the battleships looked like they were made out of lego. 10:Defiance of physics in space, holes are blasted into a space ship but there is no air leaking from it. 11: The story plot arc doesn't make sense, Luke's family is killed, okay that set's him on his course. But why is he suddenly so dedicated to the rebel cause that he calls Han Solo on not joining it. What when seeing Obi wan basically committing suicide?
Some reviewer wrote that seeing this movie made him feel like being interrogated by the KGB I had exactly that same feeling. Oh man how has this made so much money? Why are the so many people raving about it? How is it possible that this trash has gained the same cultural status symbol as the Illiad, Shakespeare or Harry Potter? At least with Harry Potter I could understand why people loved it, but with this! And what does it say about Americans when Star Wars is put on the same level as the Wizard as Oz as a hallmark of American society? I have no answer for these questions, but really this movie is crap don't waste your time on it despite a million dweebs writing on the internet that you should!""The only thing I can find to recommend this is the acting of both principles and possibly the drumming skills of Teller.
Firstly, the idea that drumming can be made into the fine art Fletcher is pretending it can is ludicrous. While the director is to be commended on avoiding the usual Hollywood happy ending, the way it does culminate just leaves the viewer feeling entirely nonplussed.
Even some of Andrew's reactions to Fletcher's behaviour are not realistic. It is similarly hard to credit that such an individual could be allowed keep his job in today's ultra-litigious world.
A complete waste of time. Avoid.""So I thought this movie was something totally different. I actually thought this was a movie that came out years ago in which DeNiro played a burglar alongside Edward Norton. Come to find out that the title of that movie was The Score. Although there was a movie called Heist from 2001 with Gene Hackman. This was neither of those. This wasn't nearly as intelligent as either of them. In fact this movie was hardly watchable, which is extremely disappointing since DeNiro was in it.
The plot is fairly simple considering the title: there was a heist. Negan, er um Jeffrey Dean Morgan, plays a struggling card dealer whose daughter is sick. He needs a ton of money to keep her on the list for a critical surgery. I didn't get it wrong, I said he needed money to keep her on a surgery list. I never knew you had pay for that. So the scene set with that simple backstory. And everything that followed was truly simple. The entire operation, the behavior of the principal actors, and the decision making was appalling. A-PALL-ING.
There was a series of some absolutely deplorable decisions that made no sense. I know that misdirection was the driving force behind a lot of the events but like Danny Glover said in Lethal Weapon, ""I'm too old for this ****"". Be more creative, be more intelligent, or just be better.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** even for a parody it'd be terrible, but this was a p*** poor excuse for a reboot. like anchorman 2 bad. ironically, kate mckinnon was the worst - zero substance to the character. the only jokes are meta, about the ""ridiculousness"" of the previous ghostbusters movies. please don't make more. this is so thoroughly ruined. if the bad guy can control all the police, why wouldn't he just control the ghostbusters? why are the metal dudes so chill about the green the green pterodactyl? why was kate mckinnon so awful in this? does bill murray just straight up disappear without closure? gawd, why even make this if you could care less about it being good - they've literally been mulling it over for 20 years, and THIS is the best you could come up with? p*** poor.""Historical costume dramas suck. With one or two exceptions (""Amadeus"", ""Elizabeth"") they're stuffy, pompous and boring. That's why I had such high hopes for ""Marie Antoinette"", Sofia Coppola's punk rock take on the doomed French queen's reign. It sounded like such a great idea: French aristocrats kicking it to Siouxsie and the Cure! Day-glo royal wigs! Rock'n'roll, French Revolution-style!
But when I saw it, my high hopes were crushed. ""Marie Antoinette"" has all the affectations of rock'n'roll, but none of the energy and passion. It's just a stuffy, pompous and boring historical costume drama, with Manic Panic hair and a decent soundtrack.
In 1770, Marie (Kirsten Dunst) is married off to Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) to create an alliance between France and Prussia. She feels lost and alone in her new kingdom, where she is disliked by the Royal Court and ignored by her manchild husband. She numbs her unhappiness with extravagant parties and expensive toys, which take a toll on the French economy and anger the starving peasantry, ultimately setting the stage for a bloody uprising.
And yes, she listens to cool bands and dyes her hair. But there the fun ends; the majority of this movie is spent watching Marie lounge around the palace and having lackluster affairs with people who look just as bored as she does. The characters are given little to do but stand there and look pretty and go through the motions of a flat, boring story. My God, this movie is dull, and all the hair dye and mix tape soundtracks in the world doesn't make a bit of difference.
As the title character, Kirsten Dunst has an air of sweetness and charm, but it's stifled by a one-dimensional character. We want to like her, but the script never gives us the chance - we never meet the person behind the crown, because there doesn't seem to be one. She's a Barbie doll, pretty but plastic, with nothing beneath her shiny surface.
The supporting cast goes to waste, as well. Swartzman seems bored with the only part in the film more underwritten than Dunst's; the great Steve Coogan (as Her Majesty's royal adviser) has maybe 10 lines, none of them funny; and Rip Torn (as the young king's father, Louis XV) looks flustered, as if he doesn't know what he's doing there. Watching the film, I could relate.
To call ""Marie Antoinette"" a failed experiment gives it too much credit: the word ""experiment"" implies that someone took a risk in trying something new. This movie just trudges through the motions of being a boring historical picture, with the occasional stream of neon and a Blondie or Gang of Four song in the background. That's not experimentation; that's putting Day-Glo lipstick on a pig.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Well, from my point of view, this movie succeeds. I do not know he has the movie, but he does not have the strength. The movie is very cold. It does not manage to transfer the penalty it should transfer. Anyone who sees someone as a whip will tremble, but watching this movie, I do not know if it is that it does not make it credible or has no soul.
The fact is that I have finished watching the movie and I am still thinking why the movie has given me equal. I do not care about anything that has happened. I saw in the final part a fact that surprised me for bad, I will explain it in the spoiler.
None of the actors seems to me to be wonderful. Neither the bad ones are bad nor the good ones are good or transmit pen.
Photography, neither counts, nor is it beautiful.
The address as it fails to convey I think it is not necessary to say anything more. But in addition, the planes are simple, does not even know how to compose.
I do not really know why this film is nominated because it is not more than a movie like many.
Spoiler: When we finally see how the slave and the family are reunited, it is normal that the grandchildren are cold because they did not know their grandfather but why was their daughter cold? Why did I stop looking for his father?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There seems to be a good movie hidden somewhere in 'Suicide Squad', but the film itself makes it nearly impossible for you to find where those good moments are. The film is its own worst enemy, because it promises something new and fresh in the first dozen or so minutes, but then nose dives into the mountain from there on out. This is certainly writer/director David Ayer's most ambitious project and I can't tell if it's his mistake or the collection of DC/Warner Bros. executives who forced the notes on him to make this film not succeed, because again, the first part of the movie gathers your hopes up for something fun. Ayer wrote 'Training Day' and 'U-571', then transitioned into directing with 'End of Watch' and 'Fury', which were both new and fresh takes on tired genres. I was hoping that Ayer could breathe new life and put the DC Comic movie franchise on the right track, but alas, that is not the case.
That being said, this is a tiny fraction better than 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but again, that's not saying much either. I still think one of the worst films in the comic book realm was the recent 'Fantastic Four' remake. That movie on a whole was just terrible on every possible level. It was the worst movie of the year for me. Nothing worked on that film. Here with 'Suicide Squad', Ayer and Warner Bros. had all of the perfect parts to make a great movie, but somewhere in post-production, everything was lost, which makes me just more disappointed in 'Suicide Squad', because they had a ton going for it, but missed the mark, seemingly on purpose. This concept is nothing new with having a team of ""bad guys"" unite to fight something worse for the greater good. Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' paved the way for this genre, which in turn gave birth to this sub genre that spawned 'The Magnificent Seven' all the way to Marvel's 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.
Those films worked on every level of entertainment and filmmaking, where 'Suicide Squad' falls short on almost every account, whether it be the horrendous and cringe worthy dialogue throughout the whole movie, the unbelievably awful plot and relationships that are just flat out silly, to the vast amount of characters who never get any screen time other than a couple of shots of action. It was all a disappointment. Since most people won't know who or what the 'Suicide Squad' is other than big comic book fans with the exception of The Joker (Jared Leto) and maybe Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) , the first part of the film introduces us to all of the characters in a roll call style montage, each with their own flashback of their skill-set, arrest, and pop song. Sometimes, we are introduced to the characters twice, which didn't make sense.
Like the trailer, Ayer filmed these biographical sequences with the use of those neon color schemes and the right amount of fun and explosiveness that promised something different that took us out of the dreary, dark, and moody DC universe, but as soon as this segment was over, it was back to dark and brooding in a dilapidated city of no color or even citizens walking around. The characters themselves are all great and have their individuality, but it never goes as far as that really. Sure Deadshot (Will Smith) shows that not only is he the world's deadliest assassin and has a chip on his shoulder in the form of Batman (Ben Affleck), but that he is willing to do anything for his 11 year old daughter, including to show her that he is not a ""bad guy"". That sounds good on paper, but the execution and dialogue is covered in smelly cheese throughout and never really investigates any of this.
Jay Hernandez's character El Diablo probably has one of the better backstories, as his power is basically that of the Human Torch, but has now doesn't use his fire power anymore, due to an accident with his family long ago. Again, this wasn't explored as well as it should have been, and instead, we got awful dialogue and a terrible flashback that ended in that dreaded camera shot panning upwards with the character looking up at the camera, screaming, ""N "". Another big problem with the film was the villain, who resembled a terrible looking Zuul from 'Ghostbusters'. The problem here is that the evil or ""villain"" part is never explained as to why or what it is, but is rather just thrown in there with the tired use of the sky opening up and everybody and everything being sucked up into the sky. This villain is known as The Enchantress and is basically a witch with powers who in turn has a romantic relationship with the military leader named Flag (Joel Kinnaman).
Again, she just owns this character from top to bottom. Her inner chaos and craziness is as good as her softer human side and you can tell she just wants to be accepted in some form or fashion. I'm glad she's getting her own film. Killer Croc's makeup is fantastic, but is only given some throwaway jokes here and there. In fact, the film had some reshoots to make the film funnier due to the backlash on 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but it was done in such a lazy manner that you can easily tell where they added the worst and cringe worthy dialogue in to try and make it ""funny"", which it wasn't. Other characters show up out of nowhere and never have anything to do but have some special skill that is never fully utilized or sought out. 'Suicide Squad' promises something good and different in its opening minutes, but then falls flat on its face and never recovers.
WAIT FOR NETFLIX!""Watch only if you are a die-hard fan of SRK who thinks he can do no wrong. The movie has nothing new in terms of the plot. No entertainment, no social message to be passed. It is just a showcase of Shahrukh Khan's fighting and some dancing abilities. Why they would cast a Pakistani Actress for such a movie is not understood. The heroine has such a small role in this movie.
I personally did not like any bit of this movie. SRK needs to take a lesson from Aamir Khan on how to make movies that are well rounded. Both actors have gone through the industry during the same time, but Aamir chooses his movies very well.""First of all, they are trying to make this type of violence realistic in a dark, gritty intense type and the rating of this movie is rated PG-13? I have to disagree, TBH, they overdid this type of realistic violence into a permanently fearful rated-R type and it might caused fear into real-life 13-year-olds of either killing or getting killed along the way.
Next, they made Harvey Dent act like a serious loud-mouth prosecutor and also proposed marriage to Rachel Dawes. But right after the Joker tricked Gordon, which led to Gordon turning down Dent too quick, Harvey grew worse than that Godfather character Michael Corleone type.
Third of all, Joker did too many tricking violent deaths and especially killing Rachel Dawes by explosion automatically. Harvey screamed like a violent victim as he was transformed into Two-Face. The worse part is that he began violently scream and kill Gordon's crew members, like Michael Corleone did in the Godfather trilogy, and also threatened Gordon's son with both coin and gun because of both his lost-love of Rachel and his job at the same time. That scene of Two-Face threatening Gordon's son with both coin and gun should have force-changed TDK rating from PG-13 to R officially. If Two-Face threatened Gordon with both coin and gun instead of his son, then we don't have to change the TDK rating from PG-13 to R officially.
Finally, that too much overdone rated-R type of fear in TDK may have additionally inserted in real-life Joker actor Heath Ledger's sleeping problems, which led to his death. That death of Heath's may have really caused TDK director Chris Nolan to suffer financial mental breakdown and panicked filming TDKR in a hap hazardous way.
I disagree that the TDKR isn't that bad at all, even if you think TDKR isn't that great as TDK, I prefer the TDKR rather than the TDK because the TDKR violence is also dark, gritty and intense, but not fearfully overdone as TDK violence, even if the terrorism violence in TDKR is considered rated PG-13 type. One last word, none of the TDKR cast members aren't dead at all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Another disappointment from Netflix. As another review said, this is silliness compounded with a lot of homosexual unfunny jokes. When I was a boy, boys did not joke around about being gay all the time - if ever. There would be lines on a sports field for example, but not like these boys today or at least in this movie. And all the male characters look as if you could have them anyway for not too much persuasion. Their clothes and the way they walk and everything.
As for the plot, it is even dumber. Ripping off drug dealers etc. and not seeming to feel any danger whatsoever. ""Big Time"" dealers who leave strangers in their bathroom where their stash is hidden and not even noticing it is gone? And the teasing the white kid gives to the Asian one is so homoerotic you know they would do each other if either one had the nerve to just go for it. The same goes for the Tony kid and his older brother. You just get the feeling they suck each other off. The whole thing about going to Brazil? What fantasy awaits there I wonder? And on and on. I didn't wait till the end to switch channels. The only obvious thing missing was sex. For example, why didn't Tony bang the gangster's girl when he had the chance? Probably because we saw the real him at the disco when they did ""moon rocks.""""I were kind of exciting to see this. I've heard good reviews but it wasn't good for sure. It basically had no plot line, no structure at all. I can't believe this movie actually is rated 15+ in our country (between pg-13 and R), and I don't think it fits. It has violence but very dull and not exciting violence. We didn't get to know the characters (I know many of us probably knew them from before) but many of us didn't know about them before. Got really disappointed and won't be seeing it again. According to me it's not worth the time and it's like superhero movies for kids, although the audience clearly isn't for children and they failed on that. It's not exciting enough for older people. 12 year old's can see this because there's no graphic or scary violence which I thought.""I know that I can't take no more It ain't no lie I wanna see you out that door Baby, bye, bye, bye...
OK, was it so bad that I had to do the N'SYNC reference for it? Maybe. I definitely have seen better.
It's a little dumb and a lot corny, which makes for a bad combo.
It tries to amp up the crazy in these ghost horror films and only ends up coming off crazy by doing so.
It does start off just right. doing everything we were hoping the whole movie was going to be, just an intense craziness, that makes you go wow, with this flash back about how this ghost effected peoples lives in the 1960s.
Then we come to modern times, and the movie starts to suck as we get to know three college age teenagers and their encounter with a ghost who when you say his name, starts you on this path of instantly, and like a chain letter if you mention this ghost to anyone they will start to feel the burn and nothing can stop him until you are dead.
The Bye Bye Man himself was not a bad concept, but trying to fully pull off can be difficult as this movie proves.
It's apart of that genre of ghost tales where it's about what goes bump in the night and how that jumps you out of your seat, which it didn't. It gets you with the superficial something is in the corner fright that anyone who paid to see the movie would want to experience, but it does not take long to get use to the Bye Bye man, and then what?
The insanity that they are trying to pull of was funny, but not that impressive.
http://cinemagardens.com""Like a plastic phoenix from the ashes of imagination, the franchise was reborn!
That's right. The Farce Awakens is a mindless rehash of Lucas' genre-defining, space opera, Star Wars: A New Hope, and fear not; plenty more instalments of Disney's latest acquisition are lined- up. Well... at least until the audience is completely turned-off and Lucasfilm stops being profitable.
A cynical abortion of 'the force' and the archetype of a medium debased of creative input. A film truly created by it's producers Bob Iger & Kathleen Kennedy, where the opinions of artists are cast aside for the ego's of Disney's executives and shareholders. All artists and creatives are merely technicians, and directors (in this case plagiarism specialist and Spielberg-Lite confectioner Jar Jar Abrams) are nothing more than floor-managers. Actors are more like wax-work figures which hit their marks and deliver their lines to time and on-cue.
The Force Awakens is the soulless epitome of today's film industry. A world of remakes and sequels. Devoid of imagination and creativity, where art is quantified a sales tally on a spreadsheet. Cinemas are factories controlled by the big 6: News Corporation (Fox), GE (Universal), Viacom (Paramount), Disney (Marvel/Lucasfilm/Pixar/Miramax), Time Warner (Warner Bros.) and Sony.
So who's to blame for this unfiltered splurge of cinematic garbage which is churned out month after month, and force-fed to it's audience like warm diarrhoea?
Us! Because we are the ones who continually finance it. Standing ovation .
In Hollywood the producer intimidates the artist's new thought with great sums of money and with his own ego that clings to the past of references of box office triumphs and valueless experience. The average artist, therefore, is forced to compromise. And the cost of the compromise is the betrayal of his basic beliefs. And so the artist is thrown out of motion pictures, and the businessman makes his entrance.

Disney: The Force Aborted Documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZBrhHTB9Wk""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.
In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.
What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?
How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.
There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.""Pros: One song is okay if you close your eyes and ignore the movie, during the course of this song the main character is eaten at least 3 times by various plants and monsters. All of this is colorful and ""fun"" of course.
Cons: Just because you add rainbows and glitter doesn't mean that it's okay for the main character to be eaten and decapitated in a children's movie.
The antagonists are raunchy and immature and eat the protagonists. They are shown eating the protagonists and this is a key plot point. Kids who can pick up on that will not be distracted by the fancy colors.
We don't enjoy watching nasty creatures give each other wedgies and kick each others butts while naked trolls fart glitter.
Walked out 30 minutes into the movie and even that was too much.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** What's bringing this film praise and attention is how this type of movie has not been created in recent years. But beyond this fact lies the qualities of a great movie that were just not present.
Sacrificed plot line, superficial, weak casting, obvious techniques, convoluted range of styles and random classic film references.
Casting: Come on! Emma Stone is no Debbie Reynolds. Neither Stone nor Gosling are dancers. Which means they would've had to learn how to for the role. Albeit it was not a disaster but it was certainly not memorable, which it be should for a 14 Oscar nominated musical. Musical. Remember JK Simmons from Whiplash (2014)? Was his role in La La Land a cameo? Not quite, but it was an absolute waste.
Protagonists: I thought (seeing from the trailer) Sebastian was going to be the energetic, doesn't-care-about-the-rules-just-cares-about the-passion kind of guy who encourages Mia, which he is at the beginning of the film. However this attitude fades and the reason wasn't made clear enough (miscommunication between Mia and Seb). Halfway through the film, we never see his passion anymore. Inconsistency? Growth? But from what?
Everyone else: Either the director was deeply trying to focus on just Mia and Sebastian or all the other characters in the film were swept aside equivalents to NPC's from The Sim's.
Dancing: Was not abundant nor top notch. Revolved around head turns and fancy running.
Soundtrack: The best component of the movie; I love nothing more than Mia and Sebastian's 'Epilogue' theme. Every other official theme of the film was also absolute brilliance; simple, dreamy, elegant, sincere, potentially iconic. Was also a beautiful motif.
Plot line: Between predictable and difficult to recall. Predictable due to it's romantic genre, difficult to recall because it was overshadowed by the film's aesthetic focus. Sebastian's scene where he sang ""City of Stars"" - a 4-5 minute scene of just him singing on the pier - had no meaning and said nothing about anyone or anything (great song though). About half way - 2/3 into the film, all excitement was lost and I was bored. Boredom peaked at Mia's audition where she spoke about her aunt. All in all, not memorable nor something someone would compliment the film on (excluding it's twist ending).
Twist Ending: The ""what could have been"" sequence was truly emotionally significant, honest and genuinely bittersweet.
Moral: I was impressed by how intensely the film focused on the reality of stardom in theater and the arts - even down to the nuances of rejection - when Mia's audition is rudely interrupted by a casting director wanting a sandwich - it truly touches the core of how quietly brutal it is to receive nothing after giving it your all, in complete vulnerability. Which is why I was disappointed when the writers abandoned this message nearing the end by slapping on a ""Five Years Later"" time skip, giving Mia the life of a successful movie star, Sebastian his Jazz Club, to dwindle the moral of the film to something like ""love doesn't go the way you imagined it would."" Because romance is everything.
Film Techniques: Effectively supported the popping visuals of the film. However at times, purposely or not, it didn't deliver what was comfortable for audiences. A full body shot that dragged on, never cutting closer to the actor's face; a close up of the actor's face for too uncomfortably long. The use of crescendos cutting to black were over used (became annoying). See when Whiplash (2014) used this for it's sudden ending? That was perfect and it was the only time it happened. The main tune motif was almost over used. See when Sebastian plays that tune at the end when he spots Mia in the crowd for the first time after 5 years? That was a perfect use of it. Can't say the same in all the other insignificant parts when it came up.
Motifs: Library, honking horn, main tune - awesome, clever.
Visual Effects: The cloud scene was awkward to watch, worst part of the film. Scenes where reality turned abstract became too obvious, sudden lighting changes (which were okay but then it happened too often), characters sweeping across settings etc.
Design: Spectacular retro feeling, yet is clearly set in the present day therefore the 20th century car models and primary colour dresses were too clearly contrived (unless we just happen to be viewing the lives of a minority population stuck/obsessed with the 60's)
John Legend's appearance: ???
Verdict: Overrated. This film had a lot of potential. It was an exciting concept. Films like this don't exist anymore. But in truth it was flawed and overall weak. However kudos to the hard work put into orchestrating and capturing mass choreographed dances in single shots. Truly visually stunning, great film techniques, successfully immerses audiences into it's dream-like world. Intensely honest look at the reality of love and artistic career paths. Original soundtrack - deserves the praise;
In every other area, it could have been more.""Moonlight started out well. Deep, rich, flawed characters you could really settle in and watch for a while. Then it goes into a weird place. it drifts off into a place I never wanted to be and brought in a bunch of characters I didn't like. It wound up seeming very long. Ali, nominated for an Academy Award, will never win because his character was dropped early. He's barely in the movie and was one of the very few likable ones in the show. Same with the mother. She was good, but hardly in the film, yet got an Oscar nomination.
I was rooting for the kid, but he turns into an unlikable thug. He turns ""hard"" and hard to root for. Then there was this weird, gay love story stuck in too. It seemed so out of place that it lent nothing to the story. Like it was just there for shock value.
Another one in 2016 that I just didn't get the hype over and don't understand all the Oscar accolades. I say skip it. It was not good at all.""IMDb reviewers will probably block this review for being an inconvenient truth.
Reading the ""BEST"" reviews of Moonlight raised Red Flags very quickly.
Voted ""Most Helpful"" these ""best"" reviews said nothing of the movie, plot, story at all ! They're hiding something they are afraid to say ! !
The purported ""best"" reviews do nothing but say "" , ahhh, how magnificent, wonderful, incredible, love the direction"" and not one thing of the story. But normal ""best"" reviews tell way too much of the story . . . ad nauseum ! ! Saying nothing of the story itself tells me the reviews are fraudulent. How is that ""helpful"" ?
I have to conclude that liberal, l g b t advocates are flooding all the 5- star reviews that deceptively hide the story line and liberal Hollywood messages and indoctrination with ""helpful"" votes to promote their agenda. Likewise, I believe the same minions trash any review that reveals the truth.
Read the ""most hated"" reviews to learn what the movie is about.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone.""Let me start off by saying I am a die hard fan of the original series so I had really high hopes for this movie. It's horrible! Slow and unsatisfying action sequences and terrible acting all around. My biggest complaint is the complete lack of detail with everything. From the clothes to the fact that everyone is Indian! Look, I'm mixed, so believe me I'm not racist. But the die hard fan in me is furious. The show has a strong Asian influence specifically Chinese. They couldn't even get the main characters ethnicity right! Come on! Even the way they pronounce his name is wrong. I disapprove of this movie so much! The director should lose his career and be banished to the Shadow Realm.""I had some big expectations for this movie, as i heard a lot about it. As it started i thought ""ok, that's not what i was expecting"" ""maybie it gets better"" well, it didn't, the jokes are very very bad and the better part of this movie has nothing to do with comedy part of it, cause its quite bad, but instead about the message it brings and the finishing of the story that for me was somehow unexpected. Either way, i rated this 3 stars, wouldn't see it again. Very poor in terms of comedy, the whole movies feels like it has very little to offer and it leaves empty, waiting for more but it never gives you anything. I should make a remark for the great performance of the leading performance, as Paul Dano really did a great job performing this character.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I hated this film deeply when it was released, today I decided I'd give it another go - alas, I still hate this film - even more than before. The reasons: 1) 'I feel more lonely than ever before'; 'I am sorry for you, cos you never knew love and friendship'; 'We've got something to fighting for' - these are just three lines the script writer (or whoever decided to put them into Harry's mouth) should be hanged, drawn and quartered. Or, at least, publicly ridiculed - for they transformed the Harry JKR wrote into Percy Weasley, for only Percy could've said these lines - cheesy, false and vomit-inducing. 2) I suspect David Yates loves Stanley Kubrick movies, especially The Shining (two little girls scene - immobile, in the centre of the frame) - for he used this approach to framing just too many times while shooting this film (and the subsequent Potter films shot by different DoPs, so it's definitely the director's fault.) While it's certainly served its purpose in the S Kubrick films, continuous usage of the same approach in HP is maddening, to say the least - it just destroys the natural flow of the narration! 3) Dolores Umbridge treatment - instead of pure evil (as described by JKR both in the book and in the subsequent interviews), Yates & Goldenberg made her quite an average power-loving bureaucrat, nothing special (conveniently forgetting the fact it was her who sent the Dementors to Harry) 4) Music - it seems disconnected from the narration and sometimes inappropriate (like re-using the Escaping from Privet Drive track for end credits. 5) Continuity & lack of logic: for ex., how come the Occlumency scene was put before Harry & Weasley's leaving Hogwarts for Grimmauld Place? Why did Sirius give Harry that Order of the Phoenix photograph at the station? It should've happened earlier. 6) Unnecessary 'heavy' special effects, like apparition of the Grimmauld Place house (making it appear like JKR described it would've been much more effective and cheaper to boot.) 7) Dialogues (in addition to what I wrote about those infamous Harry lines) - it seems like the scriptwriter took some of the lines directly from the book, but didn't bother (or just was unable) to make them sound logical in the context of the film, which resulted in, for ex., Umbridge's speech at the beginning-of-the-year feast (and Ron's reaction to it) stupid and illogical.
Certainly this was the worst Potter film. I fail to understand how Mr Yates managed to appropriate the filming rights for the entire Potter franchise after this.""This movie was an utter disappointment. Don't expect it to be an action filled western, it's very much the opposite. Nothing wrong with that, but this story and its intrigues would have done just as good as a story on radio. There is nothing visually needed to tell this story, or very little. It's not like other story heavy movies where visuals are an intricate part of the whole story, like The Usual Suspects which is actually a great example of that. To me not even the conversations between the characters is that much interesting. The characters are good with their personalities, but that is all the suspense there is in this movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""The Conjuring"" is an American English-language movie from 2013, so this one is also quickly approaching its 5th anniversary. IMDb categorizes it as a mix of horror, mystery and thriller and I think that sums it up pretty well, even if I would say the horror component is the most dominant. It runs for 110 minutes approximately and it is probably the most known work by both director James Wan and writer Chad Hayes, who worked on the script with his twin brother Carey, or at least among the most known. The film was successful enough for a sequel and that one is also by the people I just mentioned. The cast does not really include A-listers, but that's not a problem as horror films are usually much more about the scare factor and also about the script than really about great performances. The most known name you will find in here is probably Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga. She plays one half of a duo that specializes on investigating supernatural phenomenons and the Perron family are just the perfect occasion for them and their profession. This family, parents and a whole lot of children, just moved into a house at the countryside where they quickly realize things aren't normal at all. They find out an evil spirit is haunting them and it may drive them insane. So they decide to consult Farmiga's and Wilson's characters.
I personally enjoyed the first half of the film for the most part. It was nothing really new we got here, but the ways they used the unseen danger or included frightening situations was all done in a pretty competent manner. It sure manages to scare you and the camera work was done well too. Sadly, I must say the moment they really started fighting the evil spirit with the help of the married couple that are presented to us right away in the movie is when the film gets worse slowly but steadily. I did not really care for the exorcism sequences and the ways in which the Warrens/Perrons confront the enemy were also really showy, but not too memorable to me. Quite a shame because the introduction to the whole subject was pretty decent. I think the film also falls flat in really making an impact when it comes to the characters. Honestly, it felt to me as if all the family's children were entirely interchangeable and they did not seem to have any purpose in the entire project other than getting scared. Zero depth in character writing here and this also applies somewhat to the adult characters. Also the solution with the special family references about the ghost and the mother-daughter relationship they put the focus on did very little for me. This is also why at times I felt that the film took itself more seriously than it really had the right to and this went on until deep in the closing credits were we see real photos and the characters/actors liked to these. So yeah, I personally am a bit baffled by this film's awards success and strong reception. I am probably not the greatest horror film buff, but I have seen superior movies from the genre from recent years and they weren't even close to this one in terms of the strong reception. As for ""The Conjuring"", I don't recommend the watch and I have almost no interest in checking out the sequel any time soon. Thumbs down.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If you love 28 Days Later, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. This film completely proves that even if you spend 100 minutes polishing a turd, it's still a turd. It is one terrible pile of steaming hot mess that just proves that sequels directed by a different person are more than likely just a huge waste of time. I would LOVE to have 100 minutes of my life back, but even if I did, I'd still lose out on some major dignity knowing that I have watched this movie start to finish.
All of the forethought, planning, effort, and budget went into the first 15 minutes of the movie, then all funding went into the CG helicopter chopping the rage zombies to bits. After those two things, they just threw in a weak story-line and Super Rage Zombie Dad to attempt to keep the story going.
Apparently physics is super special in England, where the fire bombing will enter through an entire building, down several flights of stairs and barricaded doorways, but won't go down an alley with Super Rage Dad. And the Volvo they were driving had the BEST ventilation system on the market to not let ANY outside air/gas in to kill the survivors.
And apparently Super Rage Dad has telepathic powers to know where EXACTLY his kids will be MILES away, and can somehow beat them to their locations, UNDERGROUND in a SUBWAY. If you feel like your IQ has just dropped by 15 points, you are not alone.
28 Days Later was fabulous, it was scary as hell and it was as realistic as it could be for the original idea that it was. The sequel??? Awful, terrible, smelly, rotten piece of crap film. The only reason it didn't get a 1 star is because Harold Perrineau is in it, and he classes up most everything he's in.
If you want to join the club of people who regret watching this movie, I recommend you just watch 28 Days Later instead, and pretend there's no sequel.""This movie was terrible. I expected an interesting watch as the topic would suggest. Instead there was this boring man who didn't seem to care much about anything who met this irritating female character played by Knightley. She was so fake in this role, I didn't believe her anything - when she was sad, it was fake, when she meant to be nice and thoughtful, fake again, she was just playing it so badly. I didn't manage to watch this movie till the end, waste of time. Very superficial overall, not funny, not sad, not dramatic. Nothing. I've never liked Knightley much but I thought she was a good actress, however, she definitely killed this movie. She is not a universal actress or the script was so bad that the actors gave up on it. To summarize, this is very flat, boring movie.""Review: With the amount of money that this franchise has made, they really need to hire some better actors and script writers because this film looked cheap and amateur. Like the previous movies in this franchise, this movie is based on Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), who is now protecting Senator Charlie Roan, (Elizabeth Mitchell), who is running for presidency and totally against the Purge. Also, Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) is adamant about protecting his deli store during the Purge, with his fellow worker Marcos (J.J. Soria), and Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) who fights against the baddies while the Purge is active. During the Election Year, the new rules for this year's Purge is that government figures will not be protected, so Senator Charlie's life is at risk because there is a chance that she can win the presidency, which will go against the rich electors who want to keep the Purge alive. With Leo risking his life to protect Charlie, he turns to Joe for help after being caught in an impossible situation. They then go into hiding, with the help of some radical protesters who want to take down the rich electors, so Senator Charlie can become president, which will put a stop to the Purge. The only problem is that Charlie wants to win the election fairly, so she tries to stop the radicals from killing the rich government members, until she becomes kidnapped by the evil doers. Its full of intensity throughout and there are some gruesome scenes but it still felt like it needed some top actors. The whole Purge concept is original, and I can understand why it's a hit with movie goers but Frank Grillo is better in a cameo role, than the lead. With that aside, I did find the movie entertaining and I enjoyed the fight scene towards the end but I was expecting more from this third movie. If they decide to make a fourth film, they really need to take the Purge to another level. Watchable!
Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by James DeMonaco, who brought you the previous Purge movies and Staten Island starring Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio. With Michael Bay in the production chair, James had the opportunity to push this franchise to the big league but he chose to stay safe by making a film, which is very close to the previous Purge films. Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the franchise because it all seemed a bit ""Escape From New York"" to me but it's obviously popular with certain audiences, judging by the profit at the box office. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch but it's just not my cup of tea.
Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $118.5million
I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/horrors, starring Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti Williamson, J.J. Soria, Betty Gabriel, Terry Service and Edwin Hodge. 4/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Resident Evil Extinction manages to dumb down the plot, action, and characters since the last film, which is an impressive ""accomplishment"". As hard as I try to get invested in this post- apocalyptic series, the series just keeps getting dumber.
'Extinction' picks up a few years after the end of 'Apocalypse' as Alice left her group in hopes of keeping them safe from the remnants of Umbrella Corp, who are tracking Alice in order to produce more of the anti-virus. Meanwhile, Alice's life of solitude has apparently given her telekinetic abilities. Yes, it's just that ridiculous. But even with another new setting in the desert (ala Mad Max), the plot never takes any exciting twists and turns. In fact, I'm not entirely sure what any of the characters were ultimately trying to accomplish.
Characters that I thought were supposed to be important are either non- existent or given anti-climatic deaths. Plus, the zombies (or whatever they are calling the undead creatures) are now able to run around and climb on top of cars and buildings? I don't know about that.
Do I enjoy seeing Milla Jovovich in this role? Of course. She's been a constant bright spot through each of the first three films, but I find it hard to believe that it's enough to give a film like this a positive review. Iain Glenn is fittingly over-the-top, but why in the world does he turn into a prototypical monster in the end? At that point, the film is expectedly off the rails. Well, that's enough ranting about a film I could care less about.

4.6/10""Hi folks.
Don't even bother with this one.
Possibly one of the worst films ever made! It seems that King's novel adaptations get worse and worse as time goes on. It is just a rip-off of ""28 x Days Later"" and a very poor one at that. It's just a ridiculous zombie film which is completely unbelievable even though this is FICTION. How can two people with a gun each tackle and win over over 100 x charging zombies in 2 x minutes (in multiple scenes)? Also, nothing was explained either which was equally frustrating.
Jackson and Cusak are clearly wrongly casted for their roles and their dialogue is incongruent.
As I say, they should have left this genre to the successful likes of ""28 x Days Later"".
A complete waste of time any money.
Hope this helps . . .
Best.
Paul David Seaman (UK)""*** This review may contain spoilers *** As a film lover, I have recently gotten suspicious of biopics and historical films. These kinds of movies tend to sugarcoat the truth to present an almost typical Hollywood movie, for instance, making some people who weren't all that bad, the main villains, simply so the audiences can identify an antagonist (The Aviator is a big offender in this category). Gandhi (1982) falls into many of the these traps that other biopics fall into and as a result, becomes an over- glorification, a complete lie, and something that almost doesn't resemble a story, but merely a collage of events.
The film basically presents us with the major events of Gandhi's career: his time working against British oppression of Indians as a lawyer in South Africa, the Amritsar massacre, the March of Salt, Gandhi's assassination, etc. The events are simply presented, very accurately from what I read about these events, but the film leaves out many things about him that weren't very noble. Reading about events in Gandhi's life from all different sources, like books and online articles, I can safely say that I am appalled by some of the things that this man has done.
When fighting British oppression of Indians in South Africa, he basically ignored native South Africans that have lived in the country much longer than any Indian or British person. Second, he was cruel to his family, so much so that his son spoke out against him and later died as a drunk; he even negatively compared his own wife to a cow. Additionally, when his wife was sick, he refused to give her British medicine and yet was willing to take it himself when he had malaria. After Hitler came to power and WWII started, he wrote to Hitler, addressing him as a friend, and after the war was over, he himself said that many of the Jews from the Holocaust should have let themselves die and submit to the oppression of the Nazis. Any sensible man or woman would know that this is could be nothing more than an insane and horrible suggestion and that it would be simply impossible to deal with the Nazis using Gandhi's ideas. This was the Gandhi that so many people idolized? I even read an article from The Guardian saying that a biography about Gandhi was forbidden for publication because it revealed too many things about his life.
Other than the fact that the film is lying to everyone who sees it, the film is just too preachy. It doesn't barrage you with moral lessons every second of screen time, but half of the dialogue is moral lessons and guidelines on life and doesn't feel very natural. Even in the beginning, when it shows Gandhi's funeral, an announcer covering the funeral outright tells the audience (indirectly) what to think of Gandhi and how others, like Albert Einstein viewed him, and that we should view him that way too. Richard Attenborough, the director and producer, was actually advised against glorifying Gandhi. I don't get why he didn't take that advice to heart, considering that this was a passion project to him. Even some of the British officials in the film act like two-dimensional bad guys. One of the only positive things I can say about this film is that Ben Kingsley nails it as this film's version of Gandhi. He makes me wish that the Gandhi that has been glorified by the world was a real person, instead of the flawed and sometimes frightening human being that actually existed on this Earth. The film also has a genuinely good message, but like I said, it's just turned into a preachy sermon throughout most of the movie.
What else can I say? I was so disappointed to realize that so much of this man's life was left out and simplified simply to be more Hollywood-friendly and attract more crowds. That is complete BS. What a movie biopic should do, I think, is have the courage to present the uglier details of a person's life and as a result, feel more challenging. Plus, don't preach a moral lesson to us if a person lived by one, because that's being unsubtle. Let us figure it out for ourselves. Some of those things I said were applied in the excellent film, Raging Bull by Martin Scorsese. Not only is the film mostly true to life, according to Jake LaMotta, whom the film was based on, but it wasn't afraid to portray LaMotta as a brute of a man like he was in his boxing heyday and it didn't outright tell you what to think of LaMotta or how he was thinking; instead, it kept you guessing with Robert De Niro's performance and the cinematography. Gandhi is just too afraid to turn a man who undeniably made major contributions to humanity into anything less than what people wish to see him as. As a result, this film is disgraceful and is too much of a piece of Oscar bait to be genuinely good. I'm sorry, members of the Academy, but you made a terrible choice for the Best Picture of 1982.""Do you know Anyone who can Change there character and for get about it or feel like there are two people?? I give this movie a three because I didn't like it and didn't see how they could change them self or for that matter how can/could you drive a car but still have to people in there?? or When he wakes up and his ""Mind Buddy"" was gone but all of a sudden you get pieces of your memoirs back because you visit places?!?!?! I don't believe that could happen... but then again I didn't like they show because I don't think we should have little kids watch shows like these there going to think its okay to fight... Why would you want to show your kid this??""I really had a hard time rating this movie. Intrinsically I would not call it bad because the landscape pretty wonderful, as a would expect for surfing places that are uncommon to mass tourism; the directing, shooting, camera angles [...] are all pretty cool and coherent although I did find the action a little bit long to start.
With such a simple plot, I was really curious to see how exactly they were going to drive this out and make some sense out of it. I guess, it was a mix between a C-version of ""In the heart of the sea"" and an underpowered ""Jaws"". No doubts that they really went a little bit too far attributing superhuman power to the poor baby shark who really was not asking to be that good.
Ain't it? That's the problem of the movie to me. Under the angle I felt under which is was shot, under a realistic perspective, they tried to extend the shark beyond its capabilities and it just could not corroborate anymore with reality. This movie was clearly navigating between three or four different genres due to the extreme simplicity of the plot and the desire to make a ""serious"" story out of the whole thing.
Sharks tend to not like the taste of the human flesh/skin and attack surfers by the purest virtue of accident. They attack them because they tend to mistake them for squeals or anyways some sort of animal swimming at the surface but have no interest in having human beings for their regular meal. On that basis alone, unfortunately, the moment the shark started parking around the poor Blake Lively looking for a meal, the whole premise of the movie came to fail.
The whole Lively acting was not Oscar worthy, obviously, I'm not sure how I felt about her driving the emotions of a movie like this except probably the parts where she was feeling nostalgia remembering the good things she had left behind for her singular personal quest of riding a surfboard in the middle of nowhere. Even interpretation of physical pain weren't entirely convincing and felt more like somebody having sexual fun than one that would be really struggling from a shark attack.
Additionally, Some scenes are obviously a little bit pushed, for instance, her inability to quickly process the fact that she is in risky area and escape herself instead of waiting like an elderly for someone to grab her out from there, or, the fact that a bunch of dudes leave without even watching one last time to the horizon...
Finally, I have to admit, the unexpected relationship between Lively and a bird was actually kind of cute to say the least.""Anyone wondering how 63% of white men and 53% of white women voters in the US came to vote for Donald Trump might like this trip into the 'don't own a passport, never left my red state' fantasy land of Fox news.
Gerard Butler does a passable Sean Hannity impression - I think Morgan Freeman is doing Bill O'Reilly. Those who remember the Fox News claim that the entire city of Birmingham was a police no-go area will find the depiction of London here to be eerily familiar.
Londoners might enjoy a good chuckle, though this is much less convincing than 28 Weeks Later. Some of the climactic effects are destined for 'how not to do this' CGI highlight reels of the future.
I hope everyone involved felt their time was worth it in light of later 2016 events.""Original is not a word that comes to mind when watching the fifth (yes FIFTH) entry in this tired, worn, quite frankly burned out franchise.
What does come to mind however is the fact this franchise has gone on for far too long.
If you can't come up with any original ideas and you have to scrap the deepest barrel for the most unoriginal idea as possible, it's time to go.
If you can't keep your characters fresh and funny and make them more boring, dull and annoying to watch, it's time to go.
If you're out of jokes to use and you pull some random rabbit out of a hat and it's a rabbit that says ""Think of some really bad jokes mate."", it's time to go.
If you have 4 (yes, I do mean 4) writers and not one of them can give any good dialogue out, it's time to go.
And when a franchise that is constantly dead in the water is still going like THIS, it's time to go.
I don't care if these films still make money, Fox, it's time to put this franchise on ice forever!""The title of the film reminds of an 80s film of the same title which has been remembered for its songs. But this film has nothing to do with 80s ""Sanam Teri Kasam."" Instead it resembles some hits like ""Love Story"" (1970) or ""Prem Geet""(1981) destined for a tragic end. But you don't get fully soaked in the emotions of this film due to its entangled narrative, unlovable characters, and its over length. The beauty of the film remains only in a sparse through a decent performance by its debut actress, few song numbers and the pleasant colors used in its backdrop. For me it was a slight, passable movie which drags for the rest of your two hours.
Rating: 1 star out of 4""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Starts out weird and ends without closure. I know the art geeks seem to love it, but it was just plain bad. The only redeeming factor here is that one of Gylenhall's characters dies, as he well should have for being a complete pu**y.
The 7.7 rating is ridiculous but not shocking seeing as how weird movies that are all art and conjecture seem to get higher ratings than films that are actually entertaining and clever. The actors all do a fine job with their characters but the story line is entirely too convoluted to be entertaining. Not surprising that this pile didn't make back the initial investment (at least according to IMDb box office stats).
Don't bother going out to see this mess. If you're out of things to watch on netflix or amazon or whichever service ends up with this thing, turn the TV off and go the gym. You'll be better off.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I expected a decent watch from this. The cast seemed up to scratch but the only redeeming character is played by Benicio Del Toro he played an amazing role. Unfortunately he wasn't enough to save this rubbish movie. It was unrealistic, slow and boring. It had so much more potential to be great but missed every opportunity. At times I had trouble following the story line due to the holes in the movie. Emily Blunt is boring and was the absolute worst choice for a lead female in this instance. I was so disappointed with it it's put me off any movies by this director and that feature Emily Blunt and Josh Brolan at least for the immediate future. Bored to death!!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wed. October 17, 2006, At the very first Rome film festival. Wirld Premiere of Martin Scicese's ""The Departed"" Ahoy Tom -- Yessiree -- Life is pretty sweet here in Rome and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese and whether this is his great comeback after a string of turkeys. Well, the simple answer is:
NO --this is not the great comeback for Scorcese -- in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was ""Aviator"", which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horse manure. To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were Seriously miscast -- The best role in the whole film is Mark Wahlberg --(fast becoming my favorite Hollywood actor) -- who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of these phoney stars who walk away with all the credit --as if there was anything creditable to speak of -- while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through.
For one thing, too much rapid artsy intercutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda ""stayed in bed"", which is to say, in Hong Kong, where it started out -- and where it belongs. An exercise in glossy bullshit all around --(nobody can accuse Scorcese of not making Good- Looking, high-GLOSS films -- even if there's no 'there' there otherwise...) and also -- according to Scorcese in the following Press Con, an exercise in ""experimentation"". Well, maybe that was the problem -- It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad --the police psychiatrist, played by an unknown (and unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For Christ Sake -- Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family -- in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. -- ""The Departed"" is plain putrid. Glad you asked.
By the way the Italian press and public both lapped it but then, they were filtering it through Italian subtitles -- which made it gain things that weren't there -- or shall we say, were ""FOUND IN TRANSLATION -- Coppola that with the simple fact that neither Scorcese nor Dicaprio can possibly do Any Wrong here in Italy -- even if they ate spaghetti with chopsticks -- and you've got another smash hit here for Marty boy. Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance (paid-off?) hype to the effect that Marty is ""back in stride doing his gangster stuff"", I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will go under in America, but somebody watching the parade just hasta come out and say it --when the king ain't wearing a single goddamn stitch!
As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself as the Devil in ""The Witches of Salem"", or play an old creep on constant viagra overdose. To my mind, he's had an interesting career, but it's time for him to stay in bed --for good! Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle (a moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it), his face and name still sell tickets at the B.O. Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. As for Leonardo -- well, to see the way he beats the crap out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic, with the greatest of ease, you'd hafta think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly -- be cause he doesn't have the strength to! This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in ""Red River"". Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best -- a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it -- and just remember: Never trust a film critic! --""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Terrible. I grew up watching the professionally filmed Broadway musical with the original cast. As for the people who are complaining about the pedophile undertones, um, yes, that is the point. In the original Broadway musical the wolf costume included an anatomically correct penis, just waving around on stage. The story of red riding hood is a metaphor to warn children about predators. All of the terrible things that happen to these characters are actually true to the plots of the original fairy tales. However, this was a terrible adaptation. I expected new actors to make the songs their own and have slightly different inflection, etc. The meaning of most songs was just totally lost. For example, the Baker and his wife in ""It Takes Two"": they have no chemistry. This is supposed to be a very deep and moving song about a couple evolving to a cooperative partnership, instead they are doing somersaults and just singing at each other. The whole moral of the story is lost as they cut out critical parts of the plot. Also, the set reminded me of the swamp in the Princess Bride. I just can't say enough bad things about this version, I would need pages to write them all.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The infamous Nanavati case has inspired couple of Bollywood movies in full and many in parts over the years.
Rustom advertised as another inspiration is the latest addition and turns out to be no different than its predecessor.
A distorted, fictional account with only frame similarities with the actual incident with lots of Massala and added flavors that end up making it just another exaggerated Bollywood flick.
Bollywood has never been competent enough to portray real incidents on its merit and has traditionally always relied on eccentric counter stories, jingoism, nationalism to make a mockery of what may have really happened.
It could have been an excellent opportunity to do justice to the Nanavati story by staying loyal to the actual story since the movies made in the past on this subject have not been able to do that
So you have the character based on Nanavati fighting his own case, the cop playing chess with KM Nanavati in lock up, Jury screaming and arguing with each other as if they are sitting 500 meters apart and many many more instances when you feel your are watching just another Bollywood masala movie. The biggest distortion comes in with the Nationalist and Corruption angle in the story when there was none.
Screaming eccentric witnesses add to the agony.
The production team has done an equally bad job as the house interiors, loud bright colours and sets look like a 2015's idea of 1959 rather than what 1959 would actually have been.
A brilliant opportunity wasted. It could have stayed true to the case, been more subtle and could have become a truly international classic.
A major disappointment because the KM Nanavati Case by itself is so interesting and holds a historical importance in history of Indian Justice System for being the last time when a Jury decided a case. It marked a landmark change in the process because it was concluded that Jury could be influenced by cultural upbringing and be emotional while deciding on a case and thus could be a loophole for future convicts.
The only Bollywood movie that has stayed true to history is Black Friday on 1993 Mumbai bombings and hence is very well respected in international circuit.
Its a pity, this movie could have well attained that stature because the truth itself was so meaty that it did not require it to depend on fiction to make it interesting.
Sigh""While the whole Babadook idea, with a new monster type, creepy dark book and changing pages I was quite hyped for this movie and was really disappointed to see how low budget, continuous, slow and cliché this movie was. I didn't get to like any of the characters, the whole setup was depressing, the actions were unrealistic and boring. I do not even understand how this movie got that much ""love"". I adore psychological horror as well but this was not one of them either. I could not even finish watching the whole movie, but judging by the end I did not miss out on anything. I loved the little boy's acting though. I hope he will be famous in the near future.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie is about a world (I think) in future that people are forced to marry and they will be turned into animals if they can not or don't want to marry someone. So I think you already getting the comic idea that you expect to see in this movie. But you are wrong! It isn't a comedy movie. It is pointless, disturbing, horrible, confusing, foolish and illogical. Characters are stupid and unbelievable. The plot is boring and silly. There are lots of moments that you think why the hell they would say such a ridiculous dialogue or do such an idiotic thing. It isn't entertaining nor funny nor logical nor informative nor nothing. It is just awful.
Don't bother waste your time on it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The last thing I expected 'The Boy' to be was sensible and realistic, but even I didn't predict just how ridiculous things would get in this movie. Perhaps I would have been able to overlook some of the film's many flaws if it was actually scary, but it just isn't.
If two total strangers asked you to look after their creepy looking doll at their even creepier looking house, you'd run for the hills. But this is a horror movie, and Nanny Greta just goes along with it. When strange things start happening, even somebody stupid enough to agree to babysitting a doll would have got out of there.
Just when you think the film can't possibly get any more ridiculous, one of the most absurd plot twists I've ever seen occurs. It will almost certainly leave you in fits of laughter.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The 'different worlds thrown together by threat from authority' is obviously as old as the hills but there can be different takes on it that keep it fresh and a pleasure to see.
This is the crass and obvious take on it with none of said ingenuity applied. The storyline then needs to be rescued from being entirely predictable and this done with shock-gags and 'gross out' gags, so-called because it's 144 times less funny than it could have been.
Mark Strong is impeccably brilliant, a true gem, and plenty of supporting actors deliver great cameo-sized moments.
There are also a handful of laugh out loud moments that I loved and made me pursue the film. But not many moments and this is 90 minutes.""I would have rated it higher as the location is amazing. The action is pretty good other than the fact you have to wait until the end for any real action. The plot holes that were created by the writer were immediately obvious as soon as the credits begin to role and you think back on Act1 and 2 scenes that mislead you. Cheating by purposely misleading the viewer does not make for a good twist. It just makes you question was it due to a sloppy rewrite, running out of budget once filming began and not being able to re-shoot scenes, or change the script to support the twist...
Anyone that pays attention to the movie will realize they were cheated. Things could have been improved with a little effort and it would have easily been an excellent movie.
If you don't have many other choices on a late Saturday, give it a view and weigh in on how much the misleading twist disturbs you :-) .""You've gotta give ""Child's Play"" creator Don Mancini some credit. The man is a risk-taker to a remarkable extent, and even when it hasn't served the series, he's tried to push boundaries for good- old Chucky in different ways. After injecting a clever, postmodern riff into the popular slasher franchise with 1998's drastically underrated ""Bride of Chucky"" by incorporating elements of comedy and romance, Mancini takes the helm for the first time in his directorial debut. An attempt to satirize and pay tribute to classic domestic dramas like ""Kramer VS Kramer"", ""Seed of Chucky"" has plenty of ambition and nothing but the best of intentions. But sadly, it all-too-often falls prey to an unfortunate sense of self-indulgence and the clear signs of a first-time filmmaker in just a bit over his head. It's a mess... but at least it's an ambitious and wickedly creative mess.
Some time after the events of the last film, the living-doll child (voiced by Billy Boyd) of Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) has been kidnapped by a ""punk ventriloquist"" who exploits him for fame. After seeing the inanimate bodies of his parents on the news, being used as props for the production of a horror film based on the ""urban legend"" of Chucky the killer doll, the child escapes and makes his way to Hollywood. Using a voodoo amulet, he brings his parents back to life (I guess the dolls being used in the movie were the real-life dolls that were found at the crime scene at the end of ""Bride"" according to the in-movie logic?) and shocks them with the revelation that they are now parents. Tiffany and Chucky are dumbfounded, especially as Tiffany decides it's time for them to hang-up the knives and stop killing (rationalizing it to be a bad influence on their child), while Chucky still wants to carry on his old ""hobby."" They also quarrel over whether their child is a boy or a girl, with Chucky calling him ""Glen"" while Tiffany refers to him as ""Glenda."" At the same time, the family decides it time to transfer their souls into human bodies once and for all, setting their sites on actress Jennifer Tilly (also playing herself) and rapper Redman, while also scheming to impregnate Tilly to create a baby which Glen/Glenda can inhabit.
To give credit where it is due, Mancini does craft an often entertaining and sometimes genuinely hilarious tale, even when it frequently goes off the rails. The general premise of following up a romantic-thriller with a domestic drama is an inspired concept, and the film's numerous layers of subversion and fourth-wall breaking meta-humor are often amusing. I particularly liked the idea of Tilly playing herself and becoming the target of Tiffany's affection and fascination. I also have to say that the ""human storyline"" involving Tilly as a down-on-her-luck actress is often genuinely well-told. It almost would have made for an interesting film itself without being part of a larger ""Child's Play"" storyline. And of course the voice-acting from our three leads is just fantastic. Dourif is amazing as always, and it's honestly a ton of fun to see the character being put in a more comedic light than usual. Tilly does great work as Tiffany and gets some of the film's biggest laughs. And Billy Boyd is a very welcome addition.
Unfortunately, the good-will earned by the excellent concept, humor and casting can't quite save the film as a whole. As I said above, Mancini is a bit too self-indulgent, and by the time the second-act rolls around, the constant gags and levels of irony start to wear a little thin. Jokes start to seem forced around the time Chucky murders a Britney Spears look-alike (that's not spoiling anything, don't worry) and a paparazzi photographer played by the delightful John Waters begins making non-stop wisecracks while stalking the Tilly residence. What was clever at first becomes a crutch by the film's midway point and eventually the film loses focus in its attempts to generate non-stop laughs and the occasional jump. There's also a marked step-down in terms of production value and I can't help but feel that for a first-time director, Mancini might have bit off a bit more than he could chew. From the general structure and flow of sequences to the basic facets of visual storytelling like composition and movement, you get the sense that Mancini might have been a bit in over his head. For how inspired the storyline might have been, the same inspiration is not present in his visual direction. Thankfully, this seems to have been a good learning experience for Mancini, as he did an absolutely excellent job helming the follow-up ""Curse of Chucky""... it's just a shame that he stumbled so badly here.
While it is a mess and without doubt one of the low points in the franchise, I can't help but still see some value in ""Seed of Chucky."" Call me a pushover, but I'll take an interesting failure or an ambitious mess any day of the week... if for no other reason than to support the creativity that went into it. Just because a film doesn't work, doesn't mean it didn't come from a pure place. And if you watch the behind-the-scenes footage, you can tell that Mancini, Tilly and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place and were trying their best to make a fun and entertaining follow-up. It didn't work, but they tried and you can feel it in just about every scene.
I'm giving ""Seed of Chucky"" a sub-par but very watchable 4 out of 10. It's an interesting and highly ambitious mess. And I get a feeling that the open-minded will find a lot to like, much as I have. Just don't go in expecting perfection.""You know a movie has failed to connect when you only discover the lead character's name as the end credits roll. Apparently Nic Cage's character here was called 'Mike'. It could've been Dave, Jeff or Pete. How about Tony?
And that highlights the main problem with Pay The Ghost. I know a lot of people will have invested a lot of time and effort both on and off screen to make this movie into a finished product, but no aspect of it has sticking power at all. It feels hastily cobbled together, two dimensional and - despite having more witchy wizardy occulty evil hocus pocus magic than you can shake a dead newt at - it's ultimately dull. Where's the chill factor? As other reviews have pointed out it's just so routine you can virtually describe what's about to happen around every corner.
As for the police detective on the case and the shades-wearing guy in the underground cave, they were both so unconvincing it was comical. A few other characters seemed to arrive then leave for no reason. There was some blonde foreign woman investigator towards the end who was doing something or other...what was that about? To be honest I don't care.
This isn't terrible but it just didn't work as either a horror or a supernatural thriller.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This movie was on TV this evening and I decided to watch it partly because it has a reputation as a decent film, and partly because there was a joke that referenced it on ""You're The Worst"" this season and I wanted to get the backstory.
Since it was on regular TV, it was obvious that some bits had been cut out and some dialog had been changed to get around the R rating, but I'm pretty sure I got the gist of it. And it baffles me that anyone thought this was a great movie.
Others have done a great job of pointing out all the plot holes here on IMDb (as I did to my wife while watching it), but not many have mentioned how over-the-top melodramatic the story and acting were (as my wife did to me several times while watching it), to the point of near self-parody.
Speaking of the plot holes (SPOILER ALERT), I'll just mention that my favorite is that the wife is DRENCHED in blood after killing her ""alibi"", drives all the way home that way (without calling for help), is taken to the hospital, examined by doctors, sedated, questioned by the FBI and police and taken home again...and is STILL drenched in blood, finally showering it off at home what must have been hours later. What the heck? How was that supposed to be even remotely believable?
But maybe, just maybe, despite all that I could have found it in my heart to give this a 5 or 6 rating (after all, it did help kill three hours of an otherwise dull evening), IF IT HAD HAD SOME KIND OF ENDING. Seriously, I was really curious about how they were going to resolve this whole thing - I expected either the husband to kill the wife or vice versa, but nope. Affleck's character decides to just live fearfully and suspiciously ever after with his psycho wife, roll credits. Wow, what an anticlimax.
The movie probably still deserves a 3 or 4, but I'm going with 1 just to try to bring its ridiculous 8.4 average down a bit.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was most likely the worst movie I have ever seen and spent my time on. The beginning and the overall idea of the movie seems fine at the beginning. Rather slow and long beginning promises a nice movie about the party of 5 guys who want to relive their high school ""pub crawl"". All good, with some very nice footage of English small town and scenic pubs, up until first scene in toilet where they are suddenly attacked by robots trying to take over the earth.... If I have not spent 35 minutes already on that movie, I would most likely turn it off. And boy, was I angry at the end that I did not do it? I would only waste 35 minutes of my life and not 110!!! Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this, spend that time either on some good TV show or reading a book. I just cant imagine how someone can spend money on a movie like this...."Saw this movie today with my lover after a nice brunch at a expensive bistro and it is so boring. There are so few ghosts in the whole film and we have a farting woman and unquestionable bad hygiene. The jokes are forced and the propaganda for dyke support is clear.Also the instruments were completely unimaginative. Could they not come up with some interesting instruments? If not why make this film since there are no interesting jokes or women or even ghosts?Yes we wasted time watching this but reading the reviews on this online websites tells me there won't be a sequel so at least they won't waste our time again but hey that was my Sunday I won't get back I am sure the feminists don't care right?"This film, was utterly awful. It wasn't even one of those awful films you secretly enjoy. How on earth one man is capable of taking out hundreds of trained militants, I have no idea! I'm a huge fan of stupidly unrealistic action movies, but something about this just wasn't right. Maybe it was the fact that I was watching my country's landmarks be blown up in completely unrealistic and impossible circumstances. Maybe it was the hideous one-liners from the main cast (which included the lines; ""I'll be back"" and ""Get to the chopper"" although seemingly unintentionally). Maybe, just maybe, it was Gerard Butler's constant switching between bad American accent and confused Scotsman - either way, this film is one to skip. Watch the first one, it's a little more tolerable.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have reviewed this movie to make the review. I knew I did not like it, but I wanted to be specific. Seeing the other time, I see that I still do not like it, but I see that there are still more things that I did not remember and that I do not like. It's a great idea, although well thought out is a very dangerous idea, very sad and at the same time, I do not know if they stop to think that the human being is what is good and bad that happens to him and remember what he has lived . Without remembering things, you run the risk of repeating the bad ones. I'll need the spoiler part to explain some things
The actors are all great, yes, each one is more crazy than the previous one. I do not know how many people in real life would hold any of them more than a little while and would fall in love with them.
He has a photograph that I would define as non-existent. There are moments when the light overflows the screen. In others he uses photography for two things, to make a different film and to cover, especially at night, all the faults.
His address seems a little boring. I think the intermediate section seems very long. Apart from his typical style in all his films, the planes he makes are sometimes even poorly composed.
I would ask people if they really want to forget about their past. It may seem great to the naked eye, but if something makes us human is the good and the bad and learn to overcome the bad times.
Spoiler:
The part that I like about the movie, the ""idea"" of forgetting the bad and even finding it again and falling in love with it would be nice if it were not so badly carried out. I think he spends most of the movie obsessing the character with not accepting what is no longer, however the nice part that you finally find your partner again, you only have a few minutes of film, nothing more and That is for me one of the big mistakes.
It also has things as typical as the love of Kirsten Dunst with the boss, I have seemed a total topic.""A REAL PIECE OF SH** ! THE WORLD OF Clichés, ARTIFICIALITY AND FAKE-NESS. F r away from Reality! Nothing even close to real!

As with many new Sci-fi, the viewer in drown in a sea of special effect to cover a poor story line. This movie is crafted in pure scientist hubris, and is a lengthy attempt at explaining how humanity would self explain itself. In front a the great mystery of the meaning and origin of life, some people seems unable to accept that a few things might transcend us and would rather explain everything by our future genius and awesomeness...
Because there is no limit to what we will be, right? It is like 2001 Space Odyssey: massively overrated. The intellectual dilemma of the story is whether humanity is to be seen as a collection of individuals, or as a species, and the answer seems to be that we would be maybe our creator and self little helpers. Humanity as a stepping ladder to itself, out of darkness and non existence. Rather sad...""I read on a website that is a ""polemic"" polemic means it is bad propaganda and lies to us. In the age of President rump we will fight back the women of freedom and tradition and power. So yes Children's list is another worthless Hollywood cash-in that runs at snails pace to try to brainwash us.
Die hard Israel fans will obviously find enjoyment in this film - entering the Hollywood universe again, the stunning visuals, and soundtrack... But look closely at the film itself and there is not a lot on offer.
It starts out with this awfully paced run of throwaway scenes to showcase the main bad guy characters in the story - they go far to quick to feel any emotional connection with them later on in the film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I'd rather watch my dog sh!t for 10 minutes than watch this sh!t show of what they advertise as ""children's comedy"".

On your mark, get ready, start""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Maybe the worst movie I've been hyped to watch for a very long time!Bad plot,bad story telling,pretentious acting,over the top for no reason,a lot of completely unnecessary scenes and characters.
Most of these villains were pretty much useless,like captain b...Some could have made a difference but the dialogue and scenario was pathetic.Robin made a despicable Harley queen.After watching this I really cannot understand why so much fuss for the whole movie and especially for Harley and joker.
Silly lines all over the place,introduction scenes that meant nothing,no character development and the scenario was completely childish.So we are supposed to believe that the world was to be saved by a boomerang throwing mad man,a slutty dressed female baseball player,a samurai with bad taste in costumes and a crocman?
I did not like most of the characters but especially for Jared and robin,every time they appeared on screen, I honestly begged for them to die in some way so I would not have to suffer another minute of their horrifying acting and the terrible way the director chose to portray the joker and Harley.Totally pretentious and the romantic factor was the silliest addition one could make.
This movie ended leaving me sad and confused.My girlfriend even fall asleep!!(Go figure)...Sad because I was so hyped and expected so much more from all these characters.And confused because,how could such a distasteful movie have gotten so much hype and exciting reviews?? JUST HOW???
Joker was a big letdown and Harley even more.I guess that's why every irrelevant person on this planet loved her and dressed like her during Halloween Makes sense....
The good side is it had some decent visual effects and some nice explosions.Also Will Smith's acting was kinda nice but weak story line and dialogue here as well.Other than that it was a waste of time and expectations.""It was absolutely pathetic.. Bunch of Prozac-drugged hippies dancing to anything. This sets absolutely unrealistic life expectations for young people and you should be ashamed of allowing this abysmal piece of schnitzel to be made public.
Overly-hyped Hollywood piece of garbage that didn't need to exist. I would prefer to watch Donald Trump's inauguration speech on repeat for 72-hours straight than watching that opening scene again!

Millions of people have enjoyed the adventures described in his books. But his plots are ludicrous. When they are translated into actions by real people, as in the films of the books, the result is laughable. I can't understand how the actors in this film can have kept a straight face while they delivered the ridiculous lines. My hunch is that they all had a good laugh after each scene was filmed. None of the actors seems to have their heart in the film. Even Tom Hanks gives a wooden and unconvincing performance. A large sum of money must have been spent shooting this film, recouped no doubt by the hype of publicity surrounding it. But the result is absolute unbelievable rubbish. I've given it a score of 2 rather than 1 simply because I didn't actually fall asleep during it!""Hello, I saw this film because i like the comedy films. This film has a good rate. In my opinion I vote 2 because the film is very bad, 0 laugh for me, too much insults, male chauvinism... If u laugh with insults, vulgarities, rudeness, this is your film. Good Luck if you see the film for the rate. Loose of time. Only has a little bit good special effects and the protagonists have a very pretty body. This is not sufficient for me. I hope or you not too. If you want get revenge for one spoiler or something, say him/her that Deadpool is very good film, that you laugh all time with it.

Maybe Tom is feeling to old so he wants to slow down what happens in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back with i guess i can understand he is 55years old now. But it don't work his movies need action and bullets flying bombs going off for them to be interesting like Mission impossible and Edge of Tomorrow.
See he have 2 movies coming in 2017 hope they are better and more action then this movie.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Okay, so I am very confused here as to how this film is so highly rated.
The animation itself and the sound design and music etc, is very well done. But considering its predecessors ('Illumination Entertainment') are Despicable Me & Minions, we have come to expect this high level of professionalism.
The film as a whole was underwhelming and felt very flat. Twenty minutes into the film and the story was already very much underway and much of the 'laughs' - sorry, ALL of the 'laughs' - I had already witnessed from the countless trailers and adverts I have been subjected too since they were released about five months ago. Hence, by the time the film was finally released (Jan. 27th - UK & Ireland) the jokes were neither funny nor interesting and I was very bored.
Moreover, the cinema packed with children and their tired parents let out VERY few laughs for the jokes and throughout the film, it was relatively silent from the audience. I could almost hear the children shuffling in their seats, eight rows behind me.
The characters offered nothing new and it was a happy ending for all. Which confused me even more seeing as the obnoxious mouse got away Scott-free with his slutty mouse friend in his snazzy red sports car, paid for by the money he stole from the bears by cheating at poker.
WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT FOR CHILDREN?!
I have no idea. I have NO idea.
Bottom line, the film suffered from being over-hyped, bringing us nothing new and a theme that was very confusing. The songs used were performed well and I appreciated the concept of the animated-take on today's singing competitions.
But let's not get carried away here, the film is just about average.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Set in the '70s-'80s Gujarat, Raees when he's a teen, being inducted into the spurious alcohol industry.

I had forgot to cross it off when I saw it 6 months ago. I had forgot I had watched it, the movie is that forgettable. What really astonishes me is that I hated the movie and I still didn't remember it. Its like the observation in Rounders that we hardly remember the good poker hands but remember the bad beats exactly. Yet I still forgot this turkey, after a few months. Its not even good enough to hate.
I did remember seeing it soon after it started-- ""Ohhh, this piece of crap."" I still forgot the plot, and I fell asleep shorty after nerd-boy arrives at the compound. Fortunately I can read the ""spoiler"" reviews here and remind myself of what happened.
What a waste of talent and sets and cinematography. A simple re-write would have made the move much more interesting. The genius guy robot inventor should have been a robot too. That is the real Turing test. The quiet slave girl should have been the real human being. She had to make the inventor a guy since programming is a sexist profession and its the only way she could get taken seriously. Female 19th century authors had to pretend to be guys for the same reason.
The inventor guy should be addicted to Ritalin, not alcohol, and remember, he is the real AI robot. The movie could be a series of mini-Shyamalans, twist after twist. He thinks the slave girl is a robot, but finds she is human. He things the inventor guy is a human but he is a robot. He realizes the slave girl is the genius programmer. That is the Turing test, that he can't tell the guy is a robot and he wants to have sex with the robot girl more than the real girl, who intimidates him. Get Lucy Liu.
Then have the inventor guy robot rape the nerd. Ahh this is good stuff. And the nerd kinda liked it, but keeps wondering if he is queer since it was a machine that raped him and not a person. Note he confesses his thoughts to Ava, not the real woman. And so then he rapes Ava, and we can ponder if it is rape because rape was in his heart, even if it was a machine he raped.
A million endings come to mind, but I would have the slave girl who is really a genius programmer get bored with the whole thing, and leave the nerd trapped to starve to death, with the guy robot raping him repeatedly, and the nerd raping Ava repeatedly, until he is so weak from starvation the inventor guy robot just tosses the nerd's limp near-death body around as he finally rapes him to death. It adds a comedy dimension that the movie so needs.
Best of all, the slave girl real woman can fly out of the mess, and like the sociopath she is, start conjuring a new Turing test with new robots in a different compound. Now you got a sequel. Now you got a franchise.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ""Focus"" is an American 100-minute movie from 2015, so by now it is two years old. It was written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, a duo of filmmakers that has collaborated for a really long time and this resulted in some good and some not so good works apparently. I guess this one here is somewhere in-between, maybe closer to the not so good. It features Will Smith and Margot Robbie as the lead actors and while both are really big names, I still don't see that great talent in both of them, especially Robbie. They aren't bad actors, but they are also far from convincing unfortunately when their characters require true range and depth and they can only partially may make up for these shortcoming with their great deal of charisma. Then again, they fit nicely in here because this movie (and the script in particular) are also about make-believe. The two filmmakers I mentioned earlier definitely need a lesson in subtlety. There are many many scenes and moments, and eventually the entire film, where they go way over the top and not in a good way at all. The first meeting between the two protagonists is a good example. Yes they want to depict that teacher-student relationship and show us how skilled Smith is, but all those tricks, all that he steals from her is just too much. Half of the items would really have been enough. This is a bit of shame as the ""angry boyfriend"" scene before that was actually not too bad. And there are more food scenes like the one with BD Wong (he gave a nice supporting performance and is probably among Asia's best in Hollywood right now), which was somewhat fun to see and the best thing is you don't even have to care about American Football to appreciate it because I sure don't. But these bright moments are quickly made up for and the negative element wins eventually. It's all so pompous, pseudo-intelligent and exaggerated that it's almost impossible to appreciate the film as a whole. Robbie and Smith are just means for the story and they also do not manage to elevate the script. The weakest moment of the film is probably the ending. I was tempted to give it a better rating before that final scene with Smith's character's father, but lets be honest here. A dad who shoots his brother in the chest (even with the medical justification) is just too much and this is where the film really loses it all and hits rock-bottom. I guess you can check this one out if you really care a lot about the world of con men, but it is still not a satisfying take and elaboration on the subject either. So maybe only check it out if you are a huge Smith and/or Robbie fan. Otherwise skip it and you are not missing much, especially not in terms of realism and fraud as the biggest trick pulled off in here was to make audiences believe this is actually a convincing work. Thumbs down.""Oh, me and my decisions!
When I heard all the buzz about Sandra Bullock's performance in The Blind Side, I decided that I just had to rent the DVD. Similarly, when I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both of those decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.
Perhaps I will post a critique of papaya on some food review site (Rotten Kumquats?), but here I must review films.
Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.
Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior- high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.
Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting.
I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick. But even discounting the annoying main character, John Lee Hancock's dull and tedious direction makes this movie hard to bear.
And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry McGuire and Heaven Can Wait, can only marginally be considered football films).
However, I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already made a movie about papaya that is more palatable than The Blind Side.""Horrible. I miss Redford but this show was terrible. Since when do dragons have fur? Seriously flawed. Yuck yuck yuck. Someone dig Walt up and bring him back to life. The Disney brand has lost its innocence and appeal. Whoever owns Disney now should really go back and do some research. The show seemed more about the set up of the film rather than the quality. The old Disney is way better than stupid Disney remakes. Disney was great because the shows were sad but still uplifting and entertaining at the same time. One thing today's Disney is seriously lacking. I hated this film. It seemed more for the adults than kids. No kid wants to sit through a film that takes itself too seriously. My son is twelve and refuses to watch it because he says they ruined it. This was a terrivbke remake. The worst I've seen from Disney
Have they lost so much talent creativity they have to do all these remakes because they can't come up with their own new stuff?
So disappointed. I'll stick with the old version. It has its flaws but wa more entertaining.""I decided to watch this film because it had good reviews. I admit that I don't know anything about or have any interest in baseball, however I have watched and enjoyed other similar films with a sports theme before so I wasn't too put off. Unfortunately I think watching nearly ANYTHING else would have been better than sitting through this film. I can only describe the whole thing as bland. Bland characters, bland visuals, bland dialogue, bland music. In fact there was virtually no music accompanying the film, which I think is one of the big reasons it feels so flat. In fact, large (and I mean huge) swaths of the movie are carried out in complete silence. Everybody talks slowly and in a monotone. The sets are dull and grey. I felt nothing for the characters and was drifting off to sleep less than half way through the film. Maybe if you are an avid baseball fan you will enjoy this movie? Otherwise I honestly can't see why anyone would sit through it. Avoid!""Years ago T.was interviewed by the Italian TV, saying how big was his admiration for an Italian B movie director: Dario Argento a thriller/crime director of the 70s.Please have a look at DArgento movies, thrillers with the capital T, really scaring and suspense filled stories ,intelligente plots and often historically based scripts. Though, even my young daughter knows what a B movie is and remains nowadays a B movie. Not a myth!
How do you call a product that aims to show us, the cinema goers of the millennium, its director's perversion, unsolved teen-age ill fantasies, with a huge self esteem based on delusional disorder . He can because he is the guru of the sick generation of our era who nourish themselves with extreme porn and dangerous violence, and ""ça va sans dire"" he is poured with money to produce garbage.
Absolutely amazing how IMDb can show the trailer without warnings (with no respect) to the ones who still believe that cinema has though, his place in the Arts.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I've seen many a good film translated from book to film. Sadly, this isn't one of them.
For start, there is very little dialogue or even action in this film. Just a lot of reaction. That's fine at pivotal moments, but not every single scene. We have no idea why Eva doesn't bond with Kevin, and we are lead to believe that lack of bonding is the reason her child becomes a sociopath?
It's obvious children who are sociopaths show signs as early as 3, but there are mixed signs here. I'm also astonished at the lack of parenting they display here--why is she left alone with this child constantly if she is over whelmed? The father is never home--it reads like a cliché dysfunctional family. Sociopaths come from loving homes just as much as from dysfunctional homes. It's very apparent we are missing a greater picture of a STORY--and that's just it. There is no story relayed here--if you haven't read the book, you won't know what the heck is going on. Even then, a lot is missed from the book.
What we are left with are great performances of reactions, which over time, get to be very tiresome and wasting the performers. Every time a serious expression is creased in the lines of Tilda Swinton or any of the other performers, you expect to hear dialogue or see a scene...but nothing happens. I think in this entire film, there is probably less then 20 minutes of actual dialogue. For the WHOLE Film!!
I also found the soundtrack irritating----singles music blaring over obviously dramatic moments----to me, this film was ruined in post production.
If you want to watch an artsy film that falls hollow of a great story-line, this is it. If you want to watch a good film, sadly, this is not it. I urge you to read the book prior to seeing the film, or even cheat and pop to Wikipedia for a synopsis of the book. At least then you'd have some idea of what's going on.
But this film will leave you wondering 'why did I just watch that?""""*** This review may contain spoilers *** What's wrong? The whole movie to be honest.
You have a movie about a guy from the Middle Eastern story 1001 Arabian Nights, who lives in Italy, and Interacts with a Greek Goddess (Eris is the Greek name). Oh boy... First of all, if you can't be bothered to get the culture correct, then don't do it at all. The kids who are going to watch this movie are mostly in elementary school, they don't really know much about any of the mythology in the movie no matter what you write. The people who DO know mythology are going to be annoyed that you are mixing them up. Though I'll get off of the cultural mixing, because that's honestly the least of this movie's problem.
Let's move on to the worst thing about this movie. Sinbad, who's a thief, sexist, selfish, and a homewrecker. Notice a problem? Yeah, this is the main PROTAGONIST. The audience is supposed to root for the hero, so it's the job of the writer to make the main character likable. I'm not saying that Sinbad should be perfect, but he should at the very least be likable. The beginning starts him off as unlikable. A great thing to do would be to redeem his character in the middle of the movie. Instead, I'm more disgusted by him as the movie goes on. Sinbad goes from a selfish thief, to a selfish misogynistic homewrecker. Let me remind you, that this is the guy we're supposed to root for, how fun.
The ending of the movie becomes horrible simply because Sinbad got his happy ending and Eris lost. The sad thing about Eris is that she was right at the end, Sinbad didn't care about his friend. His friend laid his life on the line only for Sinbad to want to vacation to Fuji instead of rescuing his friend. He only changed his mind because the fiancé of his friend paid him to. Sinbad also started flirting with her in less than 10 days after he promised to rescue his friend. He also ended up taking her in the end. Tell me again, why I'm supposed to root for this guy?""This movie is similar to Pacino's movie Donnie Brasco but for one time we leave the NYC and Italian underworld for the Irish and Boston! Thus having Damon playing in it is interesting as he deepens his local ties from Will Hunting and in a way, his meeting with DiCaprio is the new generation confrontation of Pacino / De Niro. However, the pleasure doesn't go farther as this movie is just totally unbelievable: the new thug becomes close to the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the police rat, the policeman grows up with the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the criminal rat. With that, the movie just take fun to tell the most bad words and to show the most blood... All the characters are pathetic, badly played by the ordinary big names who does their same show over and over (Baldwin, Wahlberg, Nicholson who has absolutely no charisma as the boss!). The scenes with the shrink are totally useless and just add minutes to get a long movie! Sure many would praise it as it's a Scorcese but frankly, i won't watch it again while DB is much more engaging!""having watched a hefty number of 'family' flicks, from blockbusters to some of more independent productions, the BFG comes as the biggest disappointment of them all.
as it turns out, the director's name doesn't add any value to the piece. first of all the characters aren't really likable. the 'monster' is awkward and not funny at all, and the little girl comes as very annoying. the story behind the film is portrayed like someone had a deadline breathing down his neck, the 'humour' is forced and in numerous moments you'll just find yourself facepalming in disbelief - something that shouldn't happen in a good family movie.
from the start the story doesn't really engage you, and it won't till the end. the farting jokes (yes..) are probably the pinnacle of bad cinematography applied in the BFG (although 6 year olds will love them), with the final part involving the Queen following closely.
it's a really bad one, doesn't bring you much positive emotions (the dream hunting scenes are so 'meh' and look like a rip-off of a rip-off) or decent laughter either. actually the biggest surprise came at the end, as I saw Spielberg's name listed as the director... the only moment I sincerely laughed.
someone said it's sort of like 'Song of the sea' - well it's exactly on the opposite end of the scale. there are plenty cheap family flicks that are more bearable than this 140 million dollar (!!!) production.
do yourself a favor and skip this one.""There is such a thing as trying too hard to be funny, and Revenge of the Pink Panther does just that. Trying to catch the coattails of the original Pink Panther (1963) and The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), This movie just falls flat. All the original humor is gone, and the overacting is more than can be borne. By the time The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976) all the jokes had been played out and the writing had lost all of its juicy humor. The acting is just bad, and some movies are so bad, they are fun to watch, but not this one. Too much make up, karate scenes that had none of the original flavor, and overplayed lines make this movie not worth the price of the ticket. What a bad career move for Diane Cannon this was. One of the worst movies ever. Horrible. Unbearable.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Scooby Doo 2 is honestly the worst movie in the entire world, and I'm even accounting for Kool Kat. The acting might be straight from a third grade play and every actor in the movie should consider redacting it from their resumes.
First off the town that we find ourselves immersed in is named Coolsville, the lamest town ever. The characters in the movie have literally no clue what to do, and the awkward sexually confused Velma is off putting. Plus the overly girly personality of Daphne makes any normal person want to puke. Shaggy has no personality traits other than hungry dumb stoner. Fred is just a archetypal jock. And lastly Scooby Doo is a crappy CG dog that has a voice that reminds one of gurgling diarrhea.
The plot of the movie really feels like it is stitched by a two year old, who has sadly been conflicted with cataracts. I seriously have never experienced more pain in my life than when I sat through the first thirty minutes of this movie. At one point to prove that they are ""good detectives"" Shaggy and Scooby do to a villain disco joint where they dress as groovy dudes. Scooby then gets hit on, because somehow the villainous woman can't see through a badly tailored suit and an Afro wig, or does and is attracted to a dog. I'm not sure which is scarier. This movie should never have been approved let alone produced and everyone who is associated with it should hide somewhere in some cave in the Rocky Mountains.""In the dictionary, there's a word called ugly; the context includes various things such as being unpleasant, repulsive, suggestive, causing disquiet, and furthermore being totally unattractive. There's also another word called misguided, disappointing, disjointed, downgraded, boring and moronic.
These words perfectly describes this film as something that had potential to be engaging, unjustly entertaining, and possibly raw. But unfortunately it was presented with flawed material that merely descended into repetitive nonsense. Within the abyss of this disaster, there's elements that would've improved the storytelling significantly if it followed a less linear and unenthusiastic approach.
The major problem in this film isn't just the writing but the rating. It's a soulless PG-13 experience that either doesn't push boundaries when it teases it or fulfills the experience for the viewers when it loosely attempts. It's a boring drama with no emotions. A psychological thriller with no excitement or scares. A predictable and irresponsible romance with no believable, thoughtful, or even slightly less dreadful compassion. It couldn't be erotic or sensual without deliberately detracting itself.
If this film was a human, it would be a roommate with no standards.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The action spy sequel returned without its leading man as Xander Cage was reportedly killed. The NSA is under attack and Agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is a prime target as men from his old team are being murdered. He recruits a new member to the xXx program, Darius Stone (Ice Cube), a marine lieutenant from Gibbons old team that was imprisoned. After arranging an escape, Gibbons informs Stone of the new scheme. Stone uses his training and ability at extreme transportation to steal information and elude the authorities.
Agent Kyle Steel (Scott Speedman) is on his tale as Stone finds himself quickly on the wrong side of the law and questioning of authority. A plot is revealed that the Secretary of Defense George Deckert (Willem Dafoe) is eliminated the team members and changing the direction of the country. These movies are never about the plot but State of the Union spends a significant amount of time on the political intrigue and Ice Cube's espionage.

I've seen more violence and gore in scooby doo, I'm not saying every film has to be a gore fest but if you are making a tribute to the 80's slasher audience how old do you think they are, they are at least in their 40's not teens. If you're gunna do a film go all in not half hearted hoping teenagers will turn up to the cinema, trust me, my cinema is full of adults and I think everyone is getting sick of movies being targeted towards kids.
Disappointed""Too bad the lowest i can give is a 1. I swear i would have give it a 0 or less if I could.
Just awful. Very bad movie. AWFUL ACTING especially Kristen Stewart. Can't stop breathing between every word. Bad plot, no logic. Everything that makes a movie good is missing here. In order to like this movie you either have bad taste or you're a 16 year old girl/gay... with bad taste. I know girls adore vampires but this movie is just the worst. It may have ruined vampires for all the teenage girls around the world (or not)
STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!!!!""I know wars are violent. I expect to see violence in a war movie. But it should be in context and relevant to the period. The gore in this film is put there simply to satisfy those who get vitriolic pleasure from bloody vengeance..
While the misguided violence was annoying, the multitude of tactical plot holes really sank it for me. Do you really park up and ruminate life next to a burning tank full of ammunition? Do you really patrol bunched up next to an ambush threat. The war is nearly over. The Germans had realized they'd lost months ago. Would a company of soldiers fight to the last man knowing their support MG and AT guns were taken out? Did GI's really chatter away in 21st century slang? Even the hem line and thigh split in the dress of the lass hiding under the bed is unrealistic.
Two stars for good action scenes and an insight into how a tank crew operates.. Zero for script and tactical accuracy.
Movies that pitch them selves at the lowest common denominator in the theatre get none of my love.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The question is, have you got it? Not for me. The film is entertaining, takes well, looks and enjoys some things, but the problem is that like many others, treats the viewer as someone who does not think and at that time spoils it, I explain in the spoiler.
The movie has a lot of voice-over, which at least gets me out of the movie.
The best of the film, without a doubt, Kevin Spacey, plays a spectacular role. It's Kevin and we almost take it for granted, but you have to. However Chazz Palminteri, for my taste is quite improved. The rest of the actors, are in an acceptable point.
In many moments I remembered eighties action movies, both in music and in the zoom that the director does. The difference is that it has a deal that is in part very important.
Photography is sometimes bad and sometimes normal.
The address is not bad, it is simply, normal. It does not bore and is well worn, that if it does not have that tension that should have. But the planes are very normal.
This film had an excellent acceptance and was given more notice than any action, the truth is that I do not understand why it does not go beyond.
Spoiler:
I do not like anything that at the end of the movie, it retells everything again, as assuming that we will not find out and need the explanation. When you learn that good movies need several views and you always discover new things.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... meh! I love the cast but meh, it was funny at some parts and some parts where amusing but overall, it didn't do it for me. I didn't really feel anything for the characters they were all kind of rushing to get to the special effects and big ending just so they can all wrap it up and go home.
I love watching movies so it's no problem for me but damnit this was tough, after seeing it I felt robbed like there could have been other better things to see!
Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says oh CGI how I wished you could die down a bit, I miss real effects, I mean Special Effects, actual live on stage gags! Everything and everyone is so animated now a days! They just don't make them like they use to well that's good and bad.
Ryan Reynolds was great as always, but I would have liked someone more flexible in that role, someone who can morph into the victim and into the hero, someone like say Will Smith!
Imagine Will Smith in a role where he doesn't know what is going on and he gets thrown into a world that turns his perception of reality upside down and then he must become the hero to save the planet! Oh wait that was called ""Men in Black""!
A lot of people are comparing the two movies ""Men in Black"" and ""R.I.P.D"" because they have a lot of similarities. It is your first reaction to a movie you don't like. You start comparing it and adding it up to something else. It's the same thing you do when you get into a new relationship with someone, do they live up to the expectations the last person left behind?
In this case? NO! this was no ""Men in Black"", this was no ""Ghostbusters"" hell it wasn't even a ""Weekend at Bernie's"" this was just all over the place, it was a weird roller coaster on a rainy day, on a broken track run by a carny with really small hands.
It seemed like it was trying too hard to fit in and sit with us at the cool movies table so we just made fun of it and made it go away.
It did have some funny lines and silly new ideas and rules throughout the plot of the movie that was well thought out but in the end too much build up for a sight gag.
Jack ""The Parent"" says We saw this movie mainly because our 5 year old wanted to see it, she loved it, she didn't quite understand a lot of the elements in it (after life, deados) but she had a blast, this is not recommended for all 5 year olds, they can skip it, well you can skip it too!""Best paper is made out of trees. Once it's used and discarded, it gets recycled into a lower grade paper. Repeated recyclings result in a product just good enough to wipe your behind with.
It's the same thing with the Hollywood screenplays. The best stories come directly from nature. Eventually they get recycled and regurgitated into a pulp that always tastes the same and has no quality other than being the toilet fodder. Once in a while somebody somewhere in Hollywood reads an article or two about something in newspapers and jumps to use it as a new flavor to spice the old swill up a little. That's how films seem to be made these days.
That brings us to ""King Arthur"". One scientific novelty emerged in the 2000s concerning the legendary first king of England: that he may have been of Roman origin, as some new archaeological findings suggested. To some the news that sparks imagination and sheds light on that largely undocumented period of history, to others a valuable political link between the Roman Empire and the British Empire, it's something that definitely deserves to be put on screen. Unfortunately, there's that guy called Jerry Bruckheimer, that sells swill for a living, who woke up one morning and realized he needs a sword-and-sandal film in his portfolio. He hired the usual goons that approached the subject hastily and, instead of doing a proper research around the new take on Arthur, they just patched up all the gaps (and there were a lot) with the usual clichés, especially of sword-and-sandal genre, slapped on the label ""historically accurate"" and shipped it off to theaters hoping the label alone will sell it.
The tagline lied - this is by no means a historically accurate representation, even if Arthur indeed happened to be a Roman named Lucius Artorius Castus. Coming from David Franzoni, who wrote ""Gladiator"", that's hardly a surprise, though. Again, huge liberties, if we can call them that, have been taken to serve a simplistic story, based on some strange conception that people the legends were made around were already acting and talking like legends during their actual lifetime.
The battle scenes are the most obvious sign of that misguided approach. Artorius and his horsemen are too tiny a bunch to convince they'd have a meaningful impact on a battlefield other than in commanding roles. Their special skills and ability to single-handedly defeat multitudes of enemies is not what you'd see in a real battle, but rather something that would emerge in retellings afterwards, yet that's precisely what we see them do: fighting in a more ""legendary"" manner than their namesakes in ""Excalibur"". The dialog follows the same lines, but heart is confused with pathos. Artorius is stilted and artificial as if he came straight off the stage and every word he utters bears weight, meaning and poignancy, and is not necessarily in tune with what happens around him. His Sarmatian horsemen are one-note sketches, less a bonafide historical figures and more a bunch of a comic book super heroes. One has a trained hawk, one can shoot a nut off a mosquito with an arrow, one wields two swords at once, one cracks jokes... they're about as historical as Ninja Turtles. Geography grasp of the script is terrible and is a cause of crucial plot holes. The knights guard the Hadrian Wall, at the time the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire, yet they have to be informed by their superiors from the south that there is an invasion coming from the north. Wouldn't Artorius' men be the first to know? The nobleman they are ordered to collect lives with his entire entourage deep into the wrong side of the Wall, in an undefended territory, what no aristocrat, especially an important one, would ever do. On top of that it's him that shares the latest news from Rome with Artorius instead the other way round. How come the crucial communication is bypassing the keepers of the frontier all the time? Timeline is off, too, and concerns mostly queen Guinevere. The box-office nowadays calls for a strong female character, so it had to be a ""warrior queen"", not just an ordinary one. Ancient Britain does remember one queen Boudicca, a strong female military commander the new Guinevere was likely modeled after. It's just that she lived four hundred years too early for this and deserves a film of her own. No place for her here. They squeezed Merlin into the story somehow, too, but who cares. There is a dark tone to the film, which is fitting, and there is the anti-church sentiment that is about the only thing I genuinely liked.
What the film is missing is a lot. There is no ambition other than the cash grab. There is no heart. There is no connection between the warriors and the commoners who would supposedly be so enamored with Artorius to pass the legend on. There is no Uther, no Morgana and no Mordred, which is a shame because the main villain could have at least come away with a better name than ""Cerdic"". There isn't a single rape scene, either, and that's both historically inaccurate and a bit ironic: as film that successfully rapes both the history and the legend could use a good rape scene or two.""It's becoming annoying that movies nowadays are based so much on the artistic part rather than delivering a message and telling a compelling story to the audiences so that after you watch the movie you'll say ""it was worth it!"". This movie is no exception from what I wrote above, here's why:
The Science: In a movie about the invention of the first computer, you have to be scientifically authentic and I mean to use scientific terms or at least try to explain to the audiences what the hell is Enigma? In this movie Enigma is as enigmatic as the tesseract in MCU... The only moment when there's actually a hint of science is the scene between Alan and Joan where Alan tries to explain enigma to her but that scene makes Alan look like an idiot.. I mean a guy who knows so much about decrypting codes should sound like a guy trying to speak on understandable terms even though he might struggle with that due to the fact that he knows so many scientific things... Benedict tries so hard and I appreciate his effort but the writers are to blame here for a lame and hollywoodized script.
The story. I don't know the actual historical facts but the way the characters are presented to us make them unbearable and way too clichéd. I couldn't care less for Alan who's story was just used only to gave the actor playing him a great performance in order to win the Oscar. The scene at the end where he is shown to have hormonal problems is supposed to make us care for him? Why didn't they developed that early in the movie so that his character had a reason for being this way. There are tons of examples of great performances within movies that have great story and make you care for the characters and for what happens in the story. Take for example Colin Firth's performance in the King's Speech. That movie actually had a compelling story that made you care for the main character's problem, while here is just a display of Benedict's and Kera's acting. This movie's story has so many clichés, even more than Spider-man 3 I should say and here are some examples: A girl is ridiculously smart and finishes the test so fast it just points to her BING! There's the hot smart girl in this movie. The only way to make her more clichéd I guess was to write a note on her forehead saying ""This is the hot and clever chick in this movie and she'll have a relationship with the main protagonist!"" Anyway moving on... Alan is being bullied like a high school kid for being to clever, this is worse than Tobey's Peter in Spider-man(at least that movie had a compelling story and a fantastic heart to it)... I could go on like this but there's a word limit.
The music: Bland and typical Alexandre Dumas... although his score for Godzilla was way more epic and inspiring than this garbage which by the way gets nominated for Oscar, while the other score doesn't even gets nominated for an Oscar. Surprise? Just another soundtrack made to please the Oscars. There are tons of great soundtracks that didn't get nominated for Oscar and are way better than this sh*t. This just shows that not everything that is nominated for Oscars means is the best there is out there. This movie is again, no exception.
To sum up my review: This is a typically Hollywood ""trying to impress and win Oscars"" movie that has no heart and no clever or intriguing plot. I rated this movie with 1, since it can't be compared with biography masterpieces like The King's Speech for example or Rush. This movie's real rating should be around 6-7 probably more towards 7, but with IMDb's rating system and with all the so called ""critics"" here, this movie's rating inflated to 8.1, which is even higher than The King's Speech.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** ^this warning is just because my review has indeed spoilers, but that's OK. Don't watch this crap. Just read my review and move on.
I'm also writing this, because I want someone to explain to me why this pathetic excuse for a movie collects so many nominations and receives so many great reviews. I mean, more than 7/10 for the most boring, overrated movie? It all starts as some dumb girl has a car accident. She wakes up in a cellar in a bunker and she's told by a fattie that the world has ended. Then we get 90 minutes of some boring scenes. The only thing I could think was that it was stupid to drink so much coffee before seeing this crap, because I could not fall asleep. In the end, she finally escapes the bunker, and this is the part where you're allowed to laugh out loud: she destroys an alien spaceship with a bottle from the liquor store and we see her going to help others. Bam. End of the movie.""...it reeks of self indulgent and rather amateurish ensemble acting. The young people in this film never seem, for one moment like they have any idea of what they are doing. The adults are never believable. Please don't tell me that this is exactly the point and how their roles were meant to be played. Only the worst director in the world could have looked at their group scenes and said, ""now that really sizzled."" I am positive that every actor in this film (some of whom are truly gifted performers) other than Stockard Channing, (who---let's face it---has been a lot better than this)--probably cringe when they watch themselves in this. This is the only timeI have ever seen Donald Sutherland in, where he is grating and annoying. Bruce Davidson is much better than this and seems to be phoning it in. And Will Smith is NOT a revelation in this film, no matter how much people wanted him to be. He is more of a charming speech giver than someone truly invested in hischaracter. The flash back and story telling style seems like something out of Love American Style. This is a wannabe attempt at high brow film making and it does not get there. Prepare to be very bored and lectured to by a story that wants to dazzle you with style over substance.""Its the worst movie I have ever seen.I think the person who had the idea is a psycho.Can t explain this stupid and sick idea.Disgusting and sick movie , can t imagine that would like to someone and if there is someone , he is dangerous believe me. It s about an experiment of a sick doctor who wanted to make a human centipede.Can you imagine it? I can t even eat without thinking of this.I can t even believe that i spent 1.28hour of my life to see this movie . I think the director should go to jail , even if he has not made a crime , he will make people crazy like him. I don't want to give more details cause I want to forget about it.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie is a series of clichés. Denzel saves it from being 0 stars.

And the story is just too thin... A good movie has characters you care about or a good story. A great movie has both. Unfortunately, this one has neither if you haven't read the book first. The acting is good and so are the photo/look but it is not enough to make you care. And the (very) long still sequences do not add drama, anguish, curiosity...just boredom. And please, do not mention Kubrick in your reviews of this film. It is not on the same level as his work... at all. Although it feels like it tries to emulate it without success (contemporary music, strange camera play, sills).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** In Short-PASS
As you saw in my summary, it wasn't a good film. Had a few decent parts I enjoyed. I gave it a 2/10 because I did think a part or two was funny due to Jerry Seinfeld's jokes. And it did have a really important message I will go into. For now, the bad!!
It started off okay. How bees work and what they do. But then just got beezarre(Ha! Get it?) And by bizarre I mean the fact that Jerry Seinfeld's character, the bee, Barry B. Benson seems to have some weird relationship with Renee Zellweger's character Vanessa Bloome. Why you ask? Because she is a human and him a bee. Not sure why they included that element in there. For parents to watch it's painful. And to explain to the kids that bees aren't really a friendly insect to play with had me question the movie for what they were trying to teach kids.
To go on from there, a bee and a florist sue the honey business for bees to get their honey back. And that whole part was dreadful. John Goodman's lawyer character was really frustrating to watch. Again I wasn't sure how this got approved to become a movie. The jokes and storyline so far at this point had me asking myself why am I still watching this. And the only reason I ended up watching this film was because of the jokes on the internet I've seen ridiculing the film. I can see why.
Towards the end of the movie the only reason why I gave it a 2 was because of the message towards people about how important bees actually are to the world. And that is true. We need bees, they give us food and plants! So it was grand that they included that message. But the message itself wasn't a reason to get kids or parents to watch this film. I rather say choose a documentary about bees instead. Then comes the actually ending where the bee becomes a lawyer. Which threw me off so much. Because here I was thinking Barry was going to get a job working with the bees. Nope he becomes a lawyer. I was surprised how much of a cringeworthy movie this was.
Animation was okay but with how the story and plot were heading I was just dumbfounded how this became a movie. ""A Bug's Life"" (1998) and ""Antz"" (1998) turned out decent. This movie however did not. The message was brilliant. But the way they played it off was bad. Either should have changed it up with how they interacted with humans and didn't make it so ridiculous. I think that is the problem with the film.
The only good I can say about the film is it had jokes or puns that made me chuckle a bit. (Don't get me wrong, they had bad jokes and puns too!) And the message about bees. Chris Rock had a few parts that made me laugh. I can understand the movie being one of which kids will just want to watch it because it's animation. So even if you're an adult or teen I wouldn't recommend this movie nonetheless. Unless you want to watch a bad movie. But in truth this movie isn't worth the time. Pick a better children's movie or rather pick a bee documentary if you want to watch about bees.
In conclusion the film is a PASS for me. Like I mention in my review, that is basically the movie. You can read it and move on and won't miss a thing. Save your time and pick a better educating film for the kids.""The story follows a team of fictional secret agents called Baby; which is a temporary task force headed by Feroz Khan (Danny Denzongpa) formed in response to the 2008 Mumbai attacks whose job is to find and eliminate terrorists who are planning attacks in India.
While attempting to rescue a fellow Indian security agent in Turkey, Ajay Singh Rajput (Akshay Kumar) captures a traitor Jamal (Karan Anand) who formerly worked under Ajay and threatens to kill his family unless he gives them the information about their terror attack plans on India. Ajay is told about a terrorist plot to cause a bomb blast in a Delhi mall which he and Jai (Rana Daggubati) are able to prevent. In the process they learn that this was only the first, of a series of massive attacks that had been planned. Pakistan based terrorist mastermind, Maulana (Rasheed Naz), is causing trouble near the India-Pakistan border. He plans and executes a daring prison escape plan for Bilal (Kay Kay Menon).""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters.
It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight.
For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.""Not the worst film of it's type I've ever seen.
Possible Spoilers
It does strain your credulity to believe that any organisation could deploy that many people, in apparent positions of authority, with that much hardware, over a number of years without anyone noticing - it assumes that even the intelligence organisations which hadn't been compromised are sitting around doing nothing.
It's more fun playing Call of Duty - the acting is better, the plot more realistic, and best of all you get to control the main character!
Which city is next in the franchise?""There are some films that leave few memory in the cinematographic history but that make our personal memory go back in time. This is one of them. It is a rather entertaining family comedy where a very distracted scientist creates a machine that, inadvertently, shrinks his children until they are smaller than ants. Of course Disney is behind this idea. The lead role is the scientist, Wayne Szalinski. Played by Rick Moranis (who played an unforgettable role in ""Ghostbusters""), he's basically a super-stereotypical goofy nerd. In fact, the whole movie is loaded with preconceived ideas, but this is not bad since this is a comedy and the idea is to laugh. And the film succeeds in that very easily, without recourse to easy jokes. It's not a brilliant movie, it's far from a good movie, but entertain, it's great to watch with the whole family on a weekend or holiday. And that's what matters here.""Given 4 stars only for SRK. Felt comfort only with the screen presence of SRK. Utterly boring, fake characterizations.
I am ready to accept some offbeat movies and content based ones. Take Tamasha, Pink, Jolly LLB, Udta Punjab etc But, could watch only in bits & pieces. Thank my stars for missing this in theaters.
Nearly, 50 mins in to the movie, i did not find anything worth remembering.
I can say confidently, some of the documentaries are far more engrossing than this psychological torture.
Bottom line is that i don't understand this movie and the high ratings given for this.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Where do I begin with explaining how awful this movie is?
First of all, I think the entire plot was written and constructed by a rat being let loose on a keyboard typing up random crap and auto- correct turn groups of letters into words, which ended up as a ""plot.""
Let's start with the casting. They took as many big-budget actors that they could find who would be willing to join them and gave them a role. Let's take Damon and DiCaprio for example. They play two characters who are supposed to be each other's foil and yet, the two actors look so alike they are almost indistinguishable other than the fact that DiCaprio has a bit of facial hair. I normally love Jack Nicholson, but he was a bit weak and not right for his part.
Onto the main part of the movie that really was the downfall, which would be the overall plot. I would be amazed if any person on the planet was able to fully grasp this overly complex plot the very first time they watch it.
The first part that was utterly ridiculous was at early parts of the film, DiCaprio, who is supposed to be an undercover cop severely beats up people for no obvious reason. At the bar he gets one insult from a person and smashes a glass over his head. I don't think that is part of an undercover cop's duty. Later, He beats two random people from Providence, again for no obvious reason. Somehow Nicholson's character learns about this, so what does he do, He smashes DiCaprio's already broken hand with a shoe. But the really smart part is the fact that DiCaprio is more than willing to befriend the guy who just injured his broken hand. Is Nicholson really just going to let him into his crew that quickly? You would think not, but whatever.
Later in the movie DiCaprio even tells the characters played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg that they have the evidence to convict Nicholson, but they don't think they have enough evidence even though they know him to run a large scale operation with includes selling drugs, micro-processors, and killing people. And its not like Nicholson is trying to hide or anything. Just arrest the guy for crying out loud!
Later in the movie we see that Wahlberg's character is forced to step down from his position for reasons that the movie failed to explain. Then for some reason they decide to have Damon, who is one of the newest members of the team, lead the case on Nicholson.
Here comes the second most confusing part of the film (Yes it will get more confusing). During some kind of cocaine exchange the cops show up where a big gunfight follows. Nicholson is injured in the fight then reveals to Damon that he has is an FBI informant. Wait... What?!? You're trying to tell me that for the past several decades, Nicholson has been working as an FBI informant? Many unanswered questions arise from this situation: 1) How and why is an FBI agent running one of the largest organized crime groups in the city. He's killed people, sold illegal contraband and this goes unpunished by his superiors at the FBI? 2) What kind of information is he trying to get if he's supposed to be an informant? What is he trying to accomplish?
3) At the very beginning, we see him recruit Damon at the age of 12. Why is he allowed to recruit people, especially kids, for his crime group?
Moving on to the very end of the film, we now find the most confusing part. DiCaprio tells Damon to meet him on a roof so he can arrest him, which he does. But for some reason another cop shows up on the roof from the request of DiCaprio, but he sees DiCaprio as the bad guy. Damon and DiCaprio go down the elevator, DiCaprio is immediately killed by some random guy I don't recall ever seeing, then he kills the other officer who came down by stairs, then Damon kills the guy who killed DiCaprio and the other cop. At this point of the movie I am completely lost. All I know is that people are killing people for no logical reason.
At the very end of the movie, we see Damon walking into his apartment and Wahlberg is waiting for him and shoots him. Then here comes the most brilliant piece of symbolism in cinematic history, a RAT is shown walking across the balcony of Damon's apartment. Yes, a rat. Because that has to be the most clever and least cliché metaphors I have ever seen (sarcasm fully implied) because they only said the word 'rat' about 100 times during the movie.
Complaints continued: 1) This incredibly long 2 1/2 hour long movie is paced so poorly. They spend an incredibly long time on the parts that have no significance to the plot, and the parts that make no sense, they either barely touch on it or don't explain it at all (I don't need to have the plot spoon fed to me, but there is a certain point where there does need to be some explanation within the movie). 2) There is this sort of 'love triangle' going on with Damon, DiCaprio, and a psychiatrist, which adds nothing to the plot other than to make the movie longer. 3) By the end of the movie, there are 3 characters who had screen time that ended up surviving. Basically every important character ends up dead. 4) Scorsese's portrayal of violence is glorified and unrealistic.
Overall, I would definitely consider this one of the worst movies I have ever seen and would not recommend this movie even if you were bored out of your mind.""Original Ghostbusters: 8, revamped Ghostbusters: 2.
I had high hopes for this movie because I loved Ghostbusters, thought it was so funny and this revamped female version was just terrible and not funny. The only funny one was the guy, Kevin, played by hottie Chris Hemsworth. These female characters just pale in comparison to Bill Murphy, Dan Akroyd, etc... The writing was just horrible. Instead of a giant marshmallow attacking New York, it is a giant hot air balloon. And worst of all was the bad guy, his ""evil plot"" made no sense. The possession of Sigourney Weaver and her ""dog"" Rick Moranis was so great in the original and this movie offered nothing in comparison.
I can't believe this movie got financial backing.
FINAL VERDICT: This ruins the real Ghostbusters, don't watch this trash.""What is even happening?
How did this movie ever manage to grow into anything past an abstract idea hastily aborted for ringing so... drab?
Did any of the people involved want to be there?
As the unnatural movements, wooden acting, and Benjamin Button SFX face would suggest, was Brad Pitt even physically present while filming this or did he have to be entirely superimposed? Did something happen, like... he had previous engagements, had to have brunch with friends and couldn't make it, so they had to hire someone to play Pitt against a green screen or something? In which case, did they even try for Andy Serkis before they slapped those sensors onto a wholly disinterested, pregnant panda?
Is Matthew Goode even reading the contracts Hollywood is throwing his way before signing them?
Is Steven Knight ashamed of his fingers for actually following his brain's dictation into the completion of this... authorial embarrassment?
Was the editor full-on intoxicated for the duration of their task? Were they forced to edit with nothing but a pair of blunt scissors and two broken thumbs? Maybe the aforementioned bored, pregnant panda was asked to multitask?
Did Marion Cotillard finally got around to firing her agent after this?
Watching this nonsensical monstrosity completed for the first time, did Zemeckis at the very least have the decency to walk out in heavy, wet protest against this mortifyingly puzzling directorial disgrace?
I have questions. And a headache. But mostly questions.
I mean...
What is even happening?!?""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The original bible story was quite brutal in my opinion, and I would normally not show it to kids. Oh my goodness, this installment didn't disappoint. Brutal genocidal god, portrayed as kind and generous, kills thousands of innocent children and everyone cheers. It could have been a story about abolishing slavery, it wasn't, just like in the bible. Instead only Jew slaves are saved, no mention for relieving burden for anyone else. Great, let's celebrate the death of kids.
My primary reservations with the story were that an all powerful God kills thousand of innocent children, and we are supposed to cheer. Even if you want to punish slave owners, do that (like Daenerys), don't kill their children. But the got goes beyond that, not only do slavers' kids die, but also everyone else's. Only a tiny fraction of Egyptian society owned slaves, most slaves were owned by ""government"" (read Pharaoh). >99% were regular people workers, farmers and so on. Also we shouldn't forget that most slaves were probably not Jewish, rather from other religions. Non-Jewish slaves suffer pretty bad, they'd think it couldn't get any worse. Then surprise: all your children are dead.""The Coen Brothers have produced some moments of comedy gold over their careers. This film will not join their list of successes.
Why? Because this film is poor. It lures you in with a glorious cast, who should be brilliant in this, and then it repeatedly disappoints. Scene after scene of I'm sure 'hilarious moments' on paper, that end up being naff.
Channing Tatum and Scarlet Johansson aside this is a silly film, that doesn't know if it's trying to make a point about life/Hollywood or religion or not. In the end it does none of the above.
I cannot recommend this film.""This is an unusually sick, sad and true-life story about a bunch of ""sick"" opportunistic people who took advantage of a mentally and, perhaps, physically sick woman merely because she was wealthy and demented and had no sense of what a fool she had become.
I can find no redeeming quality to the movie. It was not enjoyable, enlightening, or educational; it was just SICK! It you want to watch it once, go ahead. But I, for one, didn't like seeing a person being made a clown of simply because her disease made her engage in clownish behavior. If you want to see a freak show, go to the carnival--not the movies.
I have enjoyed Meryl Streep's work for decades and have loved her talent for taking on the roles of people we know and remember well. But, I have never seen her demean a real person as she did in this movie. Here, she portrayed Florence Foster Jenkins in 1944 at the age of 76.
Jenkins was a wealthy person who had contracted syphilis from her first husband, Dr. Frank Thornton Jenkins, at about the age of 18. After finding out she had contacted syphilis from him, she reportedly divorced him and never spoke of him againalthough she did (privately) in movie. She did, however, retain his surname.
Her second husband, St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), takes advantage of her money and lack of self-knowledge about how terrible her singing ability really was. Later her pianist, Cosme McMoon (Simon Helberg), does the same thing. (Good people don't let their loved ones make fools of themselves, but they did.)
However, it was not just the people closest to her who lived off of her and laughed at her. There were many famous people of the day that were also enjoying her sick foolishness too. These people included Arturo Toscanini (John Kavanagh), Lily Pons, Cole Porter, Tallulah Bankhead, and even Enrico Caruso (not portrayed in the movie). Many of these same people came to Carnegie Hall to hear her make a fool of herself.
According to Wikipedia:
""At the age of 76, Jenkins finally yielded to public demand and booked Carnegie Hall for a general-admission performance on October 25, 1944. Tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance; the demand was such that an estimated 2,000 people were turned away at the door.[20] Numerous celebrities attended, including Porter, Marge Champion, Gian Carlo Menotti, Kitty Carlisle and Lily Pons with her husband, Andre Kostelanetz, who composed a song for the recital. McMoon later recalled an ""especially noteworthy"" moment: "" (When she sang) 'If my silhouette does not convince you yet/My figure surely will' (from Adele's aria in Die Fledermaus), she put her hands righteously to her hips and went into a circular dance that was the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen. And created a pandemonium in the place. One famous actress had to be carried out of her box because she became so hysterical.""
Since ticket distribution was out of Jenkins's control for the first time, mockers, scoffers, and critics could no longer be kept at bay. The following morning's newspapers were filled with scathing, sarcastic reviews that devastated Jenkins, according to Bayfield. ""(Mrs. Jenkins) has a great voice,"" wrote the New York Sun critic. ""In fact, she can sing everything except notes ... Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was from its proper elevation the more the audience laughed and applauded."" The New York Post was even less charitable: ""Lady Florence ... indulged last night in one of the weirdest mass jokes New York has ever seen.
This, to me, is a callous thing to do. I think the movie is callous too. This is not a comedy, it is pathos. Laughing at this movie would be a bit like laughing while watching The Elephant Man.""If a projector could vomit on a movie screen, the result would be Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge! I did not want to end that first sentence with an exclamation point, but it is part of the movie title. The perplexing punctuation point in the title could be due to one or more of the following:
a) It emphasizes that it should DEFINITELY(!) not be confused with the fine 1952 biopic of Toulouse-Lautrec starring José Ferrer. b) It is used as a warning, as in ""Danger!"" or ""Hazardous to Health!"" or ""Bad Movie!"" c) It is just an example of the unnecessary and worthless trappings that someone thought they could throw together and pass off as ""art"".
Let me see if I can sum up this mess for you:
Take a reel or two of 35mm film. Fill it with gaudy, heavy and bloated direction. Add some stomach-churning performances. Throw in a weird goulash of music. Mix it up with enough chopped up, disjointed editing as to produce vertigo,
and VOILA!
Motion picture motion sickness. Cinematic mal de mer. Projector projectile puke. Technicolor yawn.
The remedy for this malady is to view the aforementioned 1952 film, Moulin Rouge  without the exclamation point!""In the early 18th century, the court of Maratha King, Chhattrapati Shahu (Mahesh Manjrekar) needs a new Peshwa, the equivalent of a modern-day prime minister. In spite of Shripad Rao's (Aditya Pancholi) self- nomination as the Pant Pratinidhi, Ambaji Pant (Milind Soman) chooses to nominate a young Bajirao (Ranveer Singh). To test his spiritual wisdom and knowledge of weaponry, Shripad challenges Bajirao to split a peacock feather with an arrow. Bajirao succeeds and is given the title of Shrimant Peshwa. Ten years later, his wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra) is visited by her widowed friend Bhanu (Snehlata Girish Vasaikar), whose husband was accused of spying and hence was ordered to be executed by Bajirao. She bitterly forebodes that just like she longs for her husband, Kashi, too, will yearn for Bajirao.
While traveling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand infiltrates Bajirao's tent and demands his help in fighting invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of the Hindu Rajput King, Chhatrasal (Benjamin Gilani) and his Muslim Persian consort, 'Ruhani Bai'. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists that Bajirao spend Holi with them. Mastani and Bajirao develop feelings for each other and he gifts her his dagger, which is a symbol of marriage among the Bundelkhand Rajputs. He soon departs for Pune, where Kashi greets him with a tour of their newly-built Shaniwar Wada and shows him the Aaina Mahal (hall of mirrors) which allows her to see him from her room.""Over the last year or so I've been attempting to watch my way through the IMDb top 250, and as a result have watched several Indian movies due to a recent influx of films to the list. While some films have been good (Lagaan, Drishyam, Gangs of Wasseypur as examples) there are those such as Andaz Apna that are woefully lacking in merit to be rated as highly as they are. The story line, filming style and sense of humour are akin to the British Carry on movies only with more musical interludes and an extra hour in length. The story line sees our two main characters competing for the love and affection of a wealthy heiress who has recently returned from London. What follows is a series of attempts to get close to her all the while inadvertently avoiding and preventing the death/capture of the girl by an evil criminal! Sounds ridiculous? that's because it is! It's certainly not all bad and there are some moments of humour and slapstick that do raise a smile and there are little parts of the story that are inventive. However overall this film lacks enough genuine laugh out loud moments and there is little to hold the attention throughout, especially when there are some clear directions the story is going in but it leaves you waiting and waiting before they materialise on screen.
Don't base this film on a sole judgement of Indian movies, I know a number of people are unhappy at the inclusion of several 'overrated' movies in the IMDb Top 250 however it isn't the whole story, other Indian movies do warrant their inclusion, unfortunately Andaz Apna isn't one of them.""Terrible movie that exploits/uses and abuses animals for money and as objects to ""entertain"" selfish people. Animals are not ours to exploit and use however we wish. True animal lovers do not support animal exploitation and abuse, and thus will never support movies that use animals in them for profit and selfish gain.
The movie is made out to be like it is real, but everything you see in it is completely fake. The dogs are forced to do the things they do in the movie by being withheld food to perform tricks faster and more readily. The company who provided the animals for this movie, Birds and Animals Unlimited, has been charged several times in the past and found guilty of animal neglect, leaving the animals in horrible, inhumane conditions, and treating them like property.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It staggers me to read so many positive reviews of this film. It is such a vacuous, pointless exercise in style and worse - it seems to have a genuinely ridiculous message. The central conceit is that Amy Adam's character should feel guilty and remorseful as she chose to betray Jake Gylenhall's character, and not have faith in his creative abilities. But it took him a decade to write this book about his betrayal, and by all accounts it seems pretty bloody awful! Is it even published? He just sent her a copy, so we have no idea. She was probably right to leave him!
But even if we get past this central hollow idea, there is the problem of the craft of the film, which aims for Lynch but feels very studenty. Some scenes feel very awkwardly directed and over designed to the point where its hard to identify with anyone or anything on screen.
I almost forgot about the opening. What did that particular bit of imagery have to do with anything? Nothing whatsoever, it was just there for momentary effect - which i feel pretty much sums up the whole film. Flashy but empty.""Sadistic and totally devoid of any reality this is an awful film. Full of anachronisms (a settler's wife with decolletage!), ridiculous characters and improbable action sequences. One sequence was even a direct ripoff from Django. Cartoony and predictable this was a waste of money in its creation and a waste of time in my (almost) viewing. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater and my husband regrets ordering it from Netflix. The people responsible for green lighting this project should be forced to view it and then be banned from Hollywood. Stick with the original and its terrific cast. RIP Robert Vaughn, the last surviving seven.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The story is a little better than most Resident Evil movies. Not much better, but, better. The wrap-up of the franchise is OK. Of course, the whole franchise is silly, so, don't expect too much, but, in its silly world, the wrap-up makes sense... mostly.
But, that's about it. It's not very interesting or fun. There's only one funny line, near the end. It's very dark. But, literally. Most of the movie is in darkness, being very hard to see anything. Maybe the idea was to project some fearful situation, but, it doesn't work.
The fights are with too much cuts. Instead of ""wow, what did just happen!"", you're left feeling ""what the hell just happened?"".
Mila Jovovich and Ali Larter also don't look so good. Maybe it's also that the story is getting old, but, they are not appealing at all. Maybe producers should have called Sienna Guillory... then again, maybe this would ruin Jill Valentine, too.
At long last, its ""feminism in your face"" is too much. Previous installments had a little feminism. Alice was the most powerful person in this universe, but, it's by chance, not because she's a woman. There were plenty of good men. But, in this final chapter, all men are evil or expendable, women are good and triumph over them, including Ali Larter killing her lover (which Mila Jovovich gives her the pleasure to).
It's not the worst in the franchise and certainly not the worst of its genre, but, it's not good.""I am very, very disappointed. Movie is incredibly boring and, I may say, incredibly stupid.
Plot. OMG! Even a child could do a better story. Everything was already seen in hundreds of movies. Every cliché possible in 2h. Really, every part of the story is lame or illogical. For example: They go to some internet cafe trying to log in some military db, over, and over, and over, with the same username and password giving bad guys enough time to find them. Seriously? You escape military prison and then try to log into db with YOUR username and password???
Acting. Terrible. Worst acting in high budget movie I've ever seen. Why does everybody have their faces like they have eaten something bad? Looking angry (looks more like they really have to go to the bathroom) all the time does not mean that you are extraordinary tough or smart. Tom did his job bearable but everyone else are just annoying.
Visual effects. Bad. Not worst but plain bad. At least for this kind of movie.
Action scenes. Extremely bad. About every high budget action movie in the last 5 years is better.
Bottom line... Bad movie!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Even though I like Tom Hanks and I think the movie is well made, same as the others, it doesn't matter if you like the book ending better! The plot is terrible and does not make any sense at all regardless of the end.
The movie end makes more sense for the movie story, which is a totally different story from the book. Even though uses the same concept, I can say that this is no adaptation from the book, besides some of the characters names (not even the characters description was the same as the book).
If the intention was to release the virus, there was no need for ""seek and find"". The virus was to be released anyway.
There is no possible explanation for the people wanting to release the virus to use somebody to look for it and eventually try to stop the threat.

That's a song lyric and/or spoken line from Death Race 2050 (my latest review). Split screens, a game of ""chicken"", Malcolm McDowell surrounded by topless women wearing a topless toupee, virtual reality as an audience medium, video game likeness. ""Race 2050"" has it all. Sadly, it's an elevated form of cinematic torture, pure torture.
First off, I wonder what Sylvester Stallone might think of this uninspired, post-dated sequel to 1975's drive-in sensation, Death Race 2000. Currently, it's a straight-to-video release so I'm sure he might have been too busy to check it out.
Anyway, the producer of ""Race 2050"" is 90-year-old Roger Corman. The days of his Boxcar Bertha are long gone. Now, he really needs to check himself. This film is truly bad camp and frankly, I don't get how it could have any appeal whatsoever. Death Race 2050 starts off 2017 in a lousy way. Call it the nonchalant face of death and destruction. Heck, deem it the bastardized lovechild of The Running Man, the bloodied up version of The Cannonball Run, The Road Warrior for the radically inept, or the more violent, trenchant mirror of something like 1971's 200 Motels. This is hyper satire but not entertainment folks. That's unless you're under the influence of some heavy drugs (I don't endorse that notion just so you know).
Now the characters in Death Race 2050, are remorseless, unfeeling, and brainwashed. They arrive in their automobiles with the B movie techniques of rear projection and bluescreen totally evident. Their acting is hammy and shoddy. The soundtrack to ""Race 2050"" is I guess, annoying heavy metal rock. Finally, the cars featured (the title has ""race"" in it so go figure) are pointed and atypical. Within ""Race 2050's"" plot workings, heads are severed, torsos are cut in half, and blood spattering is cartoon-like. It's all fun and games till someone gets hurt. Oh yeah, everyone gets hurt and dies without so much as a whimper (or empathy for that matter).
Silly, over of the top, and taking place in the year 2050 (duh), Death Race 2050 makes you long for something more akin to 2008's remake of Death Race 2000 simply titled, Death Race. That film wasn't really good to begin with. However, it at least took itself seriously enough to be made for somewhat compelling viewing. ""Race 2050'"" tries to be compelling in its last half. It even throws around the terms ""Resistance"" and ""rebels"". Futile attempt (ha ha). Don't the producers know that this is something already taken from the Star Wars franchise? Natch.
Lack of originality and kookiness aside, ""Race 2050's"" cast is comprised of Malcolm McDowell playing the same, sadistic monitor that he channeled in last year's 31. And look for Drop Zone's Yancy Butler in a small yet overacted role (it's sad that ""Zone"" is the last flick I remember her being in). As for the special effects, well they are cheesy and caricaturish and you know what, I think the filmmakers wanted it that way. Ugh.
All in all, the story concerning Death Race 2050, is about planet Earth being post-apocalyptic and overpopulated. America has renamed its 50 states (Arkansas is now called ""Walmartinique"") and in order to control said population, drivers compete in an annual ""Death Race"". Basically, they drive across country while killing everyday denizens with their slickly automobiles (they hastily score points too, double ugh). The main trouper is Frankenstein played by New Zealand-born Manu Bennett. He's like Mel Gibson with a big fat frog in his throat. You know what, I'm just gonna refrain from going on and on. Here's my overall rating: 1 and a half stars.""The Plot.
Moana Waialiki is a sea voyaging enthusiast and the only daughter of a chief in a long line of navigators.
When her island's fishermen can't catch any fish and the crops fail, she learns that the demigod Maui caused the blight by stealing the heart of the goddess, Te Whiti.
The only way to heal the island is to persuade Maui to return Te Whiti's heart, so Moana sets off on an epic journey across the Pacific. The film is based on stories from Polynesian mythology.
This is a visually stunning movie that relies on a boring used up format for these sort of films.
Too bad.
Additionally, the songs, done by that clown who wrote Hamilton, are the worst Disney songs ever. No life whatsoever in them. You will not remember one tune. Proves he's a one hit wonder.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** So its a great plot about how the Death Star plans get into the hands of the rebels. But, the plot gets lost in the crazy amount of people, places, and things that really don't add or mean much to the story. The most interesting character in the movie, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) who plays the father of the heroine, only gets about 5 minutes of story line. Yet, he is the central figure on how the plans are made available. This movie should have been a spy-thriller, not a series of shoot-em-up battles one after the other that just don't hang together. The ending is great, and gets us where we all wanted to be - heading towards Tatooine.""The good thing about Jack Reacher - Never Go Back is that Tom Cruise looks the best among all his recent movies. Unfortunately, that is not a criteria for us to survive a nearly 2 hrs movie.
I will not talk about the story (there is hardly any). Makers of the movie should have spent more time improving the story. Action sequences are really dull. They try to look Jason Bourne like, but end up looking totally mediocre. Probably a short TV Series is best suited for such stories.
Hopefully, there will be a 3rd part to this series and hopefully, that will be worth the wait.""This is a self-satisfied, sexist little romp, with a few laughs and an affable central performance from Ryan Reynolds, one of many Ben Affleck clones currently doing the Hollywood rounds. It amazes me that anyone could possibly mistake it as in any way progressive. Its postmodern ""We know we're in a movie""is as contemporary as a Bugs Bunny cartoon.
Ed Skrein gives good villain, it's a treat to see Leslie Uggams enjoying herself in a supporting role, and there's a nice sardonic turn from T.J. Miller. The music, by Junkie XL aka Tom Holkenborg, is, in contrast to the movie as a whole, unselfconsciously generic, and is all the more enjoyable for it.
DEADPOOL will pass slightly too much of your time. It could have been shortened by ten minutes without anyone noticing. Otherwise, there's not a lot to be said for it.""I cannot believe I spent 2 hours and 5 minutes of my short life that I will never get back again no matter what. The story line was mundane, the acting was rote, and the music- OH THE HORROR! It was too loud and overbearing and went on too long in almost every scene.
The story line was muddled and really fit the characters into our preconceived notions of all of the things you see hear and read about Bostononians and New England- including the swearing, the beautiful scenery, the drinking, the fighting and the arguing.
I should have shut it off but it was kind of like watching a train wreck- I couldn't believe what I was watching had actually been given critical praise.
All I can say I let the viewer beware!""I liked the first movie, and I was hoping this would be close to as good. I like Tom Cruise a lot more now than his dumb Top Gun movie days.
But this movie just tanked. It tried to make him interesting, but it was just flat boring, and he did not demonstrate any intelligence. Mostly just grunted and responded with one word. There wasn't any romance either, c'mon Tom, don't you kiss women anymore? Are you sad about George Michael or what?
I watched Assassins Creed last week, geese I am 0 or 2 on action movies. They both sucked!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** If there is any personality trait that you want in a pilot, it's that he or she is one cool cat indeed. Call it being unflappable, having grace-under-pressure, or whatever, but you want your pilot facing an emergency to possess a singular calm that might appear almost as an absentminded detachment from the crisis.
Instead, Eastwood and Hanks' characterization of Sully paints him as a neurotic. Anyone who has seen clips of the real Sully, or even just heard his calming, mellifluous bass voice, instinctively feel that he embodies the qualities in the classic airman's acronym for flight readiness: ""IMSAFE,"" i.e. good-to-go without hindrance due to problems involving: Illness, Medications, Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue or Emotions. Ditto Eastwoods' take with the ATC handling Sully's radio calls during the emergency; he looked as if he were having a case of the vapors (instead a calmly giving Sully his alternatives, as I'm sure the actual ATC did in real life).
And old Dirty Harry just can't resist polluting his pics with gratuitous violence. The cinematic visualization of Sully's post-crash dreams where his plane plows into Manhattan skyscrapers would have been better done if pic showed Sully suddenly awakening before impact. Or better yet, avoiding such graphic scenes altogether, given the still fresh memories of the 9/11 attacks in the minds of most Americans. Too soon. And frankly, impermissibly exploitive of an American Tragedy.
Laura Linney's detached part as Mrs. Sully was an embarrassment for her and everyone subjected to her clichéd, long-suffering-wife cameo. Pure hokum, bereft of even a scintilla of chemistry between Hanks and Linney (they never even met on set; all of their scenes were shot separately).
What could have saved at least the first half of pic would have been flashbacks in much greater detail of Sully's flying history leading up to the ditching of the Airbus (there is no such thing as a ""water landing"" for an AMEL (Airplane, Multi-Engine Land). Sully was a master glider pilot, and Eastwood should have shown much more of Sully in his younger years learning the nuances of soaring a non-powered airplane, and then intercut scenes of his gliding experiences with the skills he used to bring the Airbus down safely with no engines.
The second half of pic as an endless NTSB hearing is a soporific tableau of bureaucratic nonsense. Even C- SPAN wouldn't have aired this predictable, cornball melodrama that vindicates Sully's Command Decision to avoid chancing a 180-degree turn over NYC back to La Guardia (known as the ""Impossible Turn"" in aviation parlance, due to the very low-probability of a successful power-loss return to the takeoff airport).
Knowing in advance the outcome of the story is not the problem. Compare Director Ron Howard's masterful direction of the well-known story of ""Apollo 13,"" a film I've seen several times and always gives me chills, with Eastwood's syrupy, ham-handed production of ""Sully.""
""Apollo 13"" was eminently entertaining. ""Sully,"" for all its hype, is not.""This movie is rubbish.
Uninspiring, dull,dark and depressing.
The fact that so many people gave it stars goes on to prove peculiar joys people draw from negativity and pain.
The movie does not have a clear sense of direction. It is basically the story of an (ugly looking!) problem child, who makes life difficult for himself and the people around him.
The actors are less than impressive.
The script is horrible.
The stars are truly misleading.
Take my advice; don't waste your time and money on it.
I just lost to his of my life I will never get back!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie was a very simple story line. Yes, kids might enjoy the movie. The following may be seen as a spoiler. Make a big look creature that has an appearance of being cute, kinda looks a lot like the monster in the CG animated movie 'How to train your dragon', only instead of flying, it rides underneath the hood of a truck, hence the term 'monster truck'. The parts of the movie that I despise is how Hollywood can not seem to make a movie where they have to interject their twisted hatred of something, or anything that that they seem to act on the surface that they hate. In this movie, it had to be the 'mean oil companies' that they just had to make the 'bad guys' who want to kill all the cute monsters to make a buck. Hollywood loves to make either conservatives in government the bad guys, or oil companies, or hunters, or gun owners,or any other group they choose to make look bad. It just gets under our skins when they can't even leave it out of a kids movie. They have no end to how low they won't stoop, or how far they won't go to show they have no shame. Next, they'll make a movie with little pink knitted hats and they'll be the superheroes.""Oh my word. This is one of the biggest, steamingest, festering piles of crap I've had the misfortune of sitting through.
You'll see the A-list cast and think ""how bad can it be?"" Well...it's as bad as it gets. Did Sigourney and Hugh actually read the script? I doubt it.
You know how you hear people say ""it's so bad, it's good?""...not this little clusterf*** of a story. Poorly written, poorly acted, and just plain dopey. I give it one out of ten for the efx, but please, if you're expecting equal or better than 'District 9' save your $$$. You will be disappointed.""This movie is the sequel to the movie ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", a highly successful comedy film. Here, the story continues, with the machine still working the wrong way. This time, the younger son of Professor Szalinski (Rick Moranis) was unwittingly widened to the height of a giant. And if a normal baby gives work to parents, imagine a gigantic baby... The film continues to make you laugh like the first and have moments of great tenderness. However, it does not have the same strength as the first film. Here, we already know what that machine can do, especially given the successive distractions of its creator. The other children scientist also enter the film, which retained the original cast, but it is the mother, Diane (Marcia Strassman) who has particular relevance in this sequel. Despite being a sequel, the film maintained a good quality and went well. It's interesting, fun, good to see in family, especially if you have children.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This was so bad I feel compelled to comment. Wooden, clunky, contrived plot. Unbelievable, unrealistic romantic interest. Feigned chemistry. Insufficient motivation. Unsympathetic hero. Hapless, hopeless, utterly unbelievable henchmen. Total failure to suspend disbelief.
Statham has lost sight of what makes him great: a challenging nemesis and situation that actually threatens him. The ""leverage"" the nemesis applies is ludicrous and completely undercuts any belief that Statham's character is who he is advertised to be.
If his character applied one-tenth of the effort he made complying with the bad guy's demands to instead defeating the bad guy, the movie would have been over in 20 minutes.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Even though I was just around 11 or 12 years old when this movie came out, unlike most young girls at my age, I did not understand the movie at all or why people went so CRAZY over it and why all the other fantastic Disney movies like Tangled, Brave, The Princess and the Frog weren't appreciated in their time. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I understood at that young, preteen age.
Animation: There are so many things that found annoying about the animation that I just couldn't stand. First of all, Anna and Elsa's body figures. I get that in every Disney movie ever, the lead girls were supposed to be slim and beautiful but they seemed too ""plastic"" They looked EXTRA tiny, from their very slim faces, and tiny waist, and their HUGE doll- like eyes.Take Tangled for example, we could see that Rapunzel was very tiny but at least she had the tiniest bit of chubbiness to her cheeks and arms but Anna and Elsa seem to have practically anorexic- like bodies.
Mistakes: Most Disney movies have their fair share of mistakes here and there, but in Frozen, mistakes are literally EVERYWHERE. There were COUNTLESS mistakes I could point out even as an 12 year old girl.Like in the party scene after Elsa's coronation, the same heavy- weight, tan woman was copy and pasted everywhere, there were probably more characters that were repeatedly showing up everywhere. It annoyed me so much while watching the movie. There are many more examples that I could give, but I don't have enough time. I get that it's hard in the animating room and takes SO long to animate one scene but I don't think it would be too hard to make a variety of different background characters.
The songs: These cheesy, tacky songs were absolute torture to have to sit through for the hour and a half long movie. I feel like the only half decent song in the movie was the chanting song played at the beginning and end of the movie. All others had no effect on me or the story itself, it would have been easier for the characters to just explain their struggles instead of having to sing through them for 3 minutes. Most of the lyrics are SO hard to understand, unlike most Disney Musicals, I think Disney should focus less on hiring famous people and should focus more on hiring talented people who actually know how to pronounce whilst singing.
The Plot: Disney tried so hard for there to be a huge plot twist that nobody saw coming and to my surprise, most people didn't see it coming but I certainly did. Hans was so unbelievably fishy to me, especially proposing to Anna the day they met. I knew that his seemingly perfect character was going to change. They completely made Anna's character the stereotypical good girl character and made it seem like the woman is vulnerable and pretty much helpless throughout the movie. Whereas the men are the powerful, smart ones.
The popularity: There are countless times where I heard ""Frozen is the only movie where the prince doesn't save the day"" One word, NO. These people who say that, clearly aren't real Disney fans, whereas I've seen nearly every Disney movie. Because there really are many movies where the prince doesn't save the day. The Princess and the Frog, Tiana was clearly the one who saved everyone by smashing Dr. Faciler's special amulet with the blood of the prince in it. How about the movie Brave, probably the most underrated Disney Princess movie that deserved way more credit, there wasn't even a prince, it based around a mother-daughter relationship. And what about Tangled, Flynn was not a prince, and Rapunzel saved Flynn from dying with her tears, healing his wound.
I'm not looking forward to the sequel, but I want people to be able to enjoy it if they do like the movie. Frozen just isn't the type of movie I would like""Not sure how I got caught up watching this on Liftetime but I'm sure it had something to do w/Bell and Jamie Lee. Why does Jamie Lee insist on having gray hair in every show instead of a hot color that flatters her awesome self? The movie was funny for the first few minutes then it turned into some mean, hateful drama. The over the top cruelty and seriousness of bullying and non-apologetic lead villain supersedes any fun this movie could've been. It has a wonderful cast and could've been really fun and funny. If you're thinking of buying or renting this, do yourself and favor and turn away. If you do watch this you'll keep waiting for it to lighten up and become more entertaining. I t just keeps getting worse and more disappointing. It's a shame that the movie didn't take advantage of the looks for four beautiful women in the cast. Odette and Bell are beautiful and they pale next to Jamie Lee and Sigourney. Pretty sure this guy's opinion lines up to that of the girls on here. That doesn't happen often.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First, i respect others way of thinking but the movie deals with some sort of a vague analogy from the social interaction of the many cultures that make our world, regarding the main issue i for one have read this on books but don't have the reference at this moment, but some how the center idea goes out something like in reality we do not perceive beings that are in higher or lower levels of existence, therefore we are oblivious that the higher beings form a chain of predator nature, feeding on the weaker more simpler beings, this has a strong relation to the esoteric philosophy of the early postmodernism of the 70's, that there are cosmic gators, or lions or other animals depicted by ancient cultures that some way are blah blah blah gods... this is just as a watermelon milkshake, but it speaks of the collective interest of that peculiar group of artist that make movies, and get hooked by them and sough out to express their thoughts, the way they do it is most representative of them self's, by taking that crap in to the movie theater... but to me, i have to say that they need to smoke less herbs, read more, and grow an opinion of their own, and by that you have to consume your life to endless lectures about the development of philosophy and logic, what can i share in simple words is that in some point it begins to add up, and only then you star to realize where is God, and Who he is, unfortunately the are too busy having amazing prosperous lives to care about reading Imanuel Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Levinas, Habermass, and many many more, that add bits and pieces to a far far greater than life story, that corresponds to math and physics and all that, but the main point is that the don't read as much as the should, otherwise the movie here should be less stupid, and the resources taken by this production better spent.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** This filmed had potential to be really good but the script was to conservative to test the boundaries.
The look was incredible but that is not enough to make up for a poor script. It never knew what it wanted to be and that was the problem.
It had a few cool scenes but ultimately leaves you wanting more.
The cast were fine but I'm sure they were not satisfied with what they were given.
I'm not sure why they went the direction they did for a dull overused ending but that's Hollywood these days.
I'm a fan of good stories this was simply ludicrous at times borrowing from other films but with a poorer execution.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** SPOILER
The movie in short:
First few minutes: black screen and irritating noises.
Next twenty minutes: people in monkey suits.
Next hour: spaceships and waltz or irritating noises.
Next few minutes: black screen and irritating noises (like in the beginning).
Next half hour: the computer gets mad on a spaceship (the only interesting part in the film).
Next few minutes: strange lights and strange noises.
The last minutes: WTF
I know. I don't get it. But maybe, there is nothing to get it. Maybe it's just a waste of time.""This is one more of those films that, under the popular saying ""behind a lie there is always a true origin"", seeks to reinvent a classic story, giving it new surroundings and new characters seemingly more realistic and historically accurate. It is a high but calculated risk because if there is a myth about which many alleged historical origins have been pointed out is the King Artur legend. The film is set in the final centuries of the Roman Empire and depicts the abandonment of Great Britain and Hadrian's Wall. Artur is transformed into a hired knight who serves the Romans and that it has the duty to protect a pope's favorite (at that time Christianity was already the official religion of the empire, although Celtic paganism still prevails In the British Isles) from the Saxon incursions. Obviously there are historical errors, more or less obvious, but this is not as glaring as the absence of epic sentiment in a movie that tries to be epic and never succeeds. There are even some scenes that have been ruined by minor details such as incomprehensible battle cries or cries in Latin that are never properly translated or subtitled, and which end up appearing ridiculous.
Clive Owen is good at action scenes but lacks the presence and charisma that his character demands. Arthur's knights are never developed individually except for Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson) although they are usually played by talented actors, eventually becoming highly secondary characters. Keira Knightley, an actress used to period films, played Guinevere, a character who does not suffer from the same lack of development but has been poorly thought out, overly masculinized, very stereotyped and sometimes sexualized, in a development line that ruins later attempts to make credible her wedding with Arthur, a character who spends the entire movie without any romantic chemistry with her. The film is slow and boring at times, but I dealt very well with it.
In conclusion: it is a film with an interesting story, which entertains the audience, but that is far from good.""Sacha Baron Cohen can be very hit and miss. When he hits he can be brilliant such as his Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and when he misses? Well, we have Bruno.
In the non-mockumentary category The Dictator was a fairly fun and a surprisingly funny romp and now we have the follow-up miss. The Brothers Grimsby is simply awful. Cohen and his clan of characters are so utterly unlikeable and the gross-out jokes so forced it simply is painful to watch.
Gross out comedy can work. Borat's naked wrestling scene is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. That movie earned its gross-out scene which came from the characters interactions. This movie forces ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario in a bizarre game of one- upmanship.
As for the characters. Well, the idea of James Bond having an incompetent simpleton brother following him around has good comedic potential. Cohen's character and those he surrounds himself with are simply unlikable and not a group one want to spend any time around.
Sentimental about the classless freeloading scum and gross beyond the point of funny The Brothers Grimsley is a chore to even watch.""I have never written a review before but after spending 30 mins flabbergasted reading reviews for this thing and only finding 1 review that had the same question as me i had to... how in the hell are people reviewing this movie so overwhelmingly positive? Not just like ""good movie"" - which it was definitely not - but things like ""one for the ages"" ""perfect movie"" ""hooked from start to finish"" HUH? Is this like a practice joke? Like some Internet troll where hundreds of people decided to spoof review just to F with strangers? I understand with some movies how people can like them and I have a different opinion. I can see reasons for them liking said movie and I can understand why we disagree. But I am absolutely stunned by the reviews here... some of the shots are pretty I suppose. in a dreary, dark, colorless, monotonous way.. but beyond that I saw nothing thrilling, suspenseful, entertaining. I saw no reason to care about any of the characters or what happens to them. And the ending? Is that supposed to be some shocking twist? It's crazy cuz I read critic reviews on rotten too and it was the same thing. Roger ebert or whatever 4 out of 4. Huh? I don't know.. I pride myself in life in being able to figure things out that confuse me.. having an understanding on why a thing is a certain way even if I don't see it that way.. this is something that I'm not going to be able to solve. How this movie earned such incredible reviews is the single greatest mystery of my life.""War Dogs is a movie that I think is weak, it is weak in comedy, it is not so funny, I did not laugh at it, the script is problematic, the performances are pretty much the same as Jonah Hill until it's different Of other roles, I found him a lot more serious in that film, Miles Telles until just reasonable, and the chemistry of the two does not work as well as it should, the cast still has Ana de armas, Bradley Cooper and etc, the direction of Todd Phillips who did Even good movies, he is average, he loses control of the film during the course, the soundtrack goes to taste, the film does not have memorable moments, and no dialogue, War Dogs is a weak movie, I was never excited to watch it Movie, the more I expected something better. Note 4.9""The purpose of writing, specifically when it concerns a movie's screenplay, is to tell a story through characters, dialog and setting. This movie started out with one screenplay but ended production with another screenplay--that or Maleficent's screenplay was doomed from the start. This is Angelina Jolie masturbating to herself for like two hours, but not in a good way like say for instance two hours of watching Angelina rub one out, it's two hours of Angelina masturbating to herself using sets, and CGI, and costumes, and actors, and a film director, and a screenwriter, and a production company, and a movie studio, instead of just using the fingers God gave her.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** A film by the Coen Brothers is always worth checking out, but contrary to their reputation they can either achieve cinematic brilliance (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men) or excruciating lows (Intolerable Cruelty, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou), and a number of in-betweens. Hail, Caesar is definitely not one of their crowning achievements.
The story is set in the heyday of the big Hollywood film studios and centers on studio ""fixer"" wheeler-dealer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) detailing the various fires he must put out in order to keep production rolling on some the studios future hits. Aside from the usual, Mannix must contend with the ostensible kidnapping of the studio's most popular leading man (George Clooney) from the set of a Ben-Hur style biblical epic by a cabal of Communists and ward off the machinations of twin sister gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton) on the trail of big scandals.
The film should be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it missteps entirely too often and has huge dead spots. The obvious problems with the film hit the viewer pretty quickly. Eddie Mannix was actually a real figure, but the sanitized do-gooder that we see here bears no resemblance to the real thing. Brolin is an amazingly talented actor, but here he is forced to play everything straight as the film's purported anchor, which ends up making Eddie more than a bit of a drag in the central role. In fact, Brolin/Eddie is so stiff here as to be painful.
Worse, the only time the film comes to glorious life and gives us an idea of what a success it could have been, is when it recreates in cheeky fashion some of the set pieces from yesteryear Hollywood. Alas, these moments are too few and far between, as the film gets bogged down in the tedious and criminally unfunny kidnapping plot, which takes up too much screen time and is never as amusing or subversive as the filmmakers believe. Every time we detour to Clooney and his kidnappers, you can almost hear the sigh of frustration from the audience.
An amazing cast has been compiled for the film, but a number of them are wasted. Blink and you may well miss Frances McDormand as a daffy editor or Jonah Hill as a professional patsy. Scarlett Johansson gets a nice homage to Esther Williams spectacles and shines briefly as a tough-talking actress, but is underused. Ditto, Channing Tatum, who dazzles with a Gene Kelly-esque sailor dance routine before being utterly wasted. Clooney hams it up nicely, but he is saddled with the film's worst subplot which pretty much hogties his performance. If there is a standout, it is newcomer Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry-type singing cowboy. Ehrenreich seems to be one of the few acting like he is in a comedy and is perfectly believable as the nice guy rube. Some of the film's few highlights are courtesy of him being forced to step in as a last minute replacement as lead in a British comedy of manners. His miscasting is hilarious and sets off director Ralph Fiennes into spasms of apoplexy.
Alas, the misses far outnumber the hits. The tiresome kidnapping plot that dominates the screen time is ultimately pointless. Between the respectable recreations of old-style Hollywood splendor set pieces, most viewers will be checking their watch. The film is episodic and haphazard - it also needs a decent editor to remove what bits simply do not work. The whole thing culminates into a disappointing viewing experience.""I'm the one of those who think that any movie, despite it's message or sense or purpose, shouldn't be boring. And this one is so boring. Is it for old people? Over 80? It's partly comedy, no way! There's nothing funny inside. Thriller? Be serious! This is slow...hmm....drama. I don't know what's so dramatic in this movie. There's no reason for existence of such a movie. If You don't know what to do in next 2 hours, go to sleep or watch Your flowers growing, You'll spend better amount of time than watching this rubbish. Even acting, despite respectable crew, is nothing special. Nothing in this movie should attract attention. It's simply boring. Period.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The good: The outstanding performances of Miles Teller as Andrew and J.K Simmons as Fletcher. They both were incredible in their parts and it seemed as if they gave their best in portraying the two male leading roles. The film surely wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for these two to lift it off. I also liked the fact that this film pays tribute to jazz music which is so overlooked in this age and time.
The bad: Pretty much everything else. It seems like the initial goal of this film is for us to sympathize with the protagonist and share his ambition. We are supposed to like him, admire him for his persistence and cheer for him as he is trying hard to succeed in what he wants the most. But soon, we discover that Andrew's character is a self- centered, self-righteous, arrogant guy who thinks he is the best musician that has ever existed just because it is his ambition to become one. He hurts everyone else's feelings and diminishes them because he seems to believe he is more talented than them (as if it's him who decides that). For example, when he tells the girl he was supposed to be dating, that he does not want to date her anymore because she will slow him down, she asks him if that is because she said she doesn't know what she wants and he is positive. Which means that in his mind, just because he has found a thing he is passionate about, he is superior to the girl, who hasn't found a hobby or career path. Before that, when he is at the dinner table, he seems agitated because his family is not always talking about him and his drumming thing. He tries to change the subject back to his drumming and proceeds to diminish their talent because he really does think they will never amount to him. Which means that although he doesn't like the emotional abuse he is receiving from his teacher, he likes mentally abusing other people.
Furthermore, I do not clearly understand what this film is trying to prove or make us believe. That it is okay to be emotionally scarred for life if some teacher says it's for your sake? Are we supposed to be relieved when the teacher reveals he is being cruel only to motivate the students to be the best and say ''Okay, he wasn't that bad of a person'' because I don't think that's a sane thing to do. The way to motivation should not (and is illegal to) include battering the students, calling them names, using their family background to verbally abuse them and insulting them in numerous ways. So, even if the teacher thought that was the way to make them better, it does not make him a better person. It makes him a monster.
What's even worse is that Andrew seems to like his teacher in a weird way. He knows he is a good teacher and an even better musician so he is trying to look up to him and be the next Charlie Parker. Which means, he has to be as mean and as selfish as his teacher already is so that the teacher finally gives him his blessing. Is that what we want our kids and fellow men to do? Can't someone be the greatest musician ever without being an arrogant guy that puts other people down and admires the wrong kind of people? Couldn't Andrew just be humble and a nice person with the same persistence and drive?
Another thing that really angered me off is how Andrew is indecisive. He swings from wanting to kill his teacher to cooperating with him to get him to like him. He confesses that his teacher is verbally abusing everyone in his class, he knows that the teacher's ways have led to someone's suicide so it looks as if he understands how bad of a person Fletcher actually is. Then he talks to Fletcher, plays with him at the festival as if there is nothing wrong whilst still admiring him as a teacher and musician. And after he finds out his former teacher has betrayed him by ordering a new song he didn't know, he leaves enraged, only to return to his drum set and give everything he's got....Is he suffering from bipolar personality disorder or is he just not sure of what he wants in life?
Overall, I did not like much in this film. Sure the performances of Teller and Simmons were something else and the cinematography is brilliant but in the end, this film should not be anyone's favorite.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The best looking trash !!! this is what this movie really is!!!.

Not one single moment and character in this movie is played by the logic and common-sense.""I don't like any Altman films, so I didn't expect much from this one, and didn't get anything.
Meanders from one meaningless, unrelated scene to another.
It's like the long intro scene is the model of the rest of the movie.
It got to the point where the dialogue ceased to mean anything.
I can hear the words, but nothing is registering.
The fact that all these stars would appear in this dog says more about them and Hollywood than all the pseudo-jokes.
It devolved into watching a stream of cameos.
As one reviewer said, better to turn off the sound and just watch the celebs, one after the other.
As I said, I don't like any Altman film. Like Mash, with the long, boring, pointless football game at the end, where they spit on Radar. Sure it became a good TV series, but Altman didn't write the script.
Also, ""The Player"" was too long. After a while, it even gets boring to watch a parade of celebs. And the movie within the movie. I guess they though it was pretty clever then, and people do now, but it's been done many times before, and better. I guess if you're at a Hollywood party, with everyone stoned and drunk, and The Player is playing, everyone hardly watching, and people are saying, snootily, ""Oh, look at that"", one could acknowledge that this movie exists. Otherwise, no.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** There really isn't any point in this film. The story is minimal, it's incredibly long and finally pointless.
Death comes to an old man nearing his birthday telling him he's going to die soon. The man's daughter is planning a lavish party for him, while his son in law (who works for him) is preparing a merger/take-over in his big business. The news of his imminent death changes him - he becomes distracted, disinterested in the lavish party and reverses his business decisions, he doesn't want the merger anymore.
The son-in-law organizes a boardroom coup to go through with the deal anyway. The daughter organizes the party anyway.
On the day of the lavish birthday party (during, actually) the old man foils the coup and ousts his son-in-law from the company. The company survives. The lavish party is nice. Then the old man dies.
That's the story. I missed the part where death dates his other daughter, but that's completely inconsequential to the story. Long story short, the daughter meets Brad Pitt in a cafe, he dies, death takes his body, now death visits her dad with Brad Pitt's body, dates his daughter with Brad Pitt's body (but death's personality), until the end where the old man dies. Then death leaves Brad Pitt's body for the original body and personality to come back and date the same woman again.
Long story short, it doesn't matter who you are as long as you have Brad Pitt's body. You can be a fan of coffee or a huge peanut butter fan, you could have a career as a pro-bono volunteer or be death itself, doesn't matter, the same girl will go out with you either way.
The film is filled with long epic, dramatic music, wailing violins and ends in the longest, cheesiest manner, fireworks and dramatic score music, as the old man dies and Brad Pitt returns to his long lost love who had a relationship two other men (her husband + death) in the mean time.""The movie moves at a good pace, the street scenes are nicely filmed. The 80's - or rather the late 70's atmosphere is well present in the movie despite somehow simplistic set-ups and presence of spare era elements - cars, clothes, etc.
The movie does a poor job of expressive the Iran atmosphere of that era, or at least the daily life or a hint of the culture of Iranian people under the regime, probably because it was filmed on a budget and mostly not on location.
So the plot line is quite well written and filmed. What's is shocking is the rave reviews considering the main character play is null. Unless you are a hard core fan of Ben, there is just no play from this character. He has decent play in other of his films, but here it seems he's forcing himself not to show emotions or expressions. The remaining of the cast does an OK job, Goodman is up to the job but all of them seem detached from each other, acting individualistically.
There are other historical hostages crisis movies out there, some of them are magical, tense and impregnate with local atmosphere of the specific times. This movie is not even at the bottom of the list.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Nothing else was on, so I gave this movie a shot. Ryan Gosling's character purports to love his daughter, but is a complete screw up of a drunk father, barely coherent, stumbling through life and death situations and making it out by dumb luck. Russell Crowe's character is somewhat better, but is the stereotype of tough guy with a soft spot for the kid. The two of them, especially Crowe, commit violence that should land them in prison for life, but face no consequences. Barely even a 'don't do that' from police. There's big corruption supposedly being done, that will be revealed in a supposed porn film. Truthfully, the kid Holly is the best thing in the film, and even that is a stereotype -- smart kid who does everything she's told not to and saves all the adults... Billed as hysterically funny, I found it just incredibly stupid, nothing but bad writing and bad acting.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I wanted to like this movie. I kept thinking I love this genre and there are some gorgeous shots, what's wrong? And figured it out. Shannon thinks he can get by with the dark and moosy thing, never talking. But he's wrong. His face is anxiety producing. His insecurity seeps through everything he does. He's an abysmal actor who relies on dark and moody. Just skip it and anything he is is. OK I need more text. The guy who played sevier was amazing. A total scene stealer. The state trooper friend was imminently likable. Kirsten dunst was as always brilliant. But forget ever watching boring insecure face act again.""After watching about two scenes from the movie, my thoughts were, ""if this were a 90s movie, I'd probably give it a 6/10"" but it's 2011 for crying out loud. I read some reviews saying it's for kids, leave your minds by the door to enjoy the movie. Speaking as someone who watched the first three installments as a kid and teen, this was a disappointment. Bland humor, terrible effects, bad lines and delivery. Maybe it's similar to the first installment in effects but that was 2001 and that was the best they could do. And that's why we enjoyed it. My parents enjoyed it then and they didn't have to drop their brains and forget every ounce of sensibility to do so. We saw the best effects, animations and adventures of that time and we had to think outside the box to understand it. It's different with this movie, it was 2011, better technology, new ways to add elements to the movie and this was the best you could come up with? I hope by 2020, we won't be asked to act like zombies, forget we have brains or go with the excuse ""for 4 year olds only"" to enjoy epic fails like this. You know how you can do better? Don't treat the audience like senseless carrots.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have read some of Stephen King's novels but after reading CELL, I didn't read any more. I found it poor in concept and that bizarre other worldliness that some of his novels have didn't fit.
The movie is not any better. The on-set of the ""effect"" was interesting in how fast it happened. That fact people affected travelled in groups and retained some intelligence had the potential to be scary. Lots of plot holes the main one being the cell phone transmission. Yes many of us use the phone but unlikely in any given space 50% of the people would be on the phone. As it became quickly apparent what was causing the problem then 50% of the citizens would have been unaffected and likely 90% of the military. The roads were unblocked for the most part so no explanation for not using a car to drive the bulk of the distance. Instead of taking a few days, it could have been done in an afternoon.
It is worth watching if you are really bored or need a nap.
There was a time when John Cusack did good movies. Lately not so much and I think it was the Ex Producer of this as well.""I am an avid movie watcher and collector with over 1900 movies in my collection .. some brilliant some niche .. some awful.
This is the first film I have watched and taken the blu-ray to a 2nd hand shop to sell ... the morning after I bought and watched it.
Says it all really.
Silly Story nonsense in most scenes, never ending bullets, very poor CGI, I love a Jason Statham flick and you get what you expect on so many levels .. but this was just so cr*p.
Very very disappointing considering the first Mechanic with Statham was such a well made movie in its genre.""All the epic impact of a Power Rangers TV episode.
It did nothing to challenge common Asian stereotypes either.
How unfortunate that I saw this on the heels of Chinese New Year (Happy Year of the Rooster, by the way).
Dialogue that gave me flashbacks from awful '70s sitcoms.
One of the worst movies that I have ever seen.
I can only hope that Kurt Russell received a decent paycheck for this effort.
Please excuse me, I have to finish making some popcorn.
After that I'm going to go to a Roger Ebert review of this movie, if it exists, and pray that the late great critic came to the same conclusion.
Then, apologies in advance, I'm going to order some Hunan Chicken for take-out dinner tonight.
Thanks for reading, 'til then.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Wow! This is by far the most incredibly boring film I think I have ever seen. Brad Pitt should really be ashamed of TRYING to portray Jessie James. My God, Pitt shows almost NO emotion of any kind through out 2 hours and 40 minutes of the worst kind of torture bad acting, stupid voice over, terrible plot lines and equally pathetic supporting actors. What a total wast of time. Stay away at all costs. Probably the very worst aspect of the overly long Hollywood mistake was the horrible voice over of Robert Ford. I did not fully understand what he was trying to do with the film. What ever he was trying to do didn't work at all. It seemed the only reason for them extreme length of the bizarre western was to get all of the voice over into the film. I say that Pitt playing Jesse should have been killed off in the first 10 minutes of this ""Titanic""of a film. I can only give this film a 1 out of 10.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** if you have not watched this film, then my sincere request is don't watch it. do not even read reviews. change channels when you see the movie playing. Have you ever seen bad films? have you ever seen films which you have no idea about? (do not bring Kubrick or Nolan in it). ADHM is so bad that it will give you cancer in your eyes. rich people, rich places, rich clothes but doing things that even nursery kids will n to do. Everyone is falling in love with everyone in the movie and yet there is no love story. basically what Rockstar did in 15 minutes with 2 songs, ADHM took 2 hours to explain. sincere advice to Karan Johar- stoop making weird films. and stop asking actors to do cameos in your movie. and stop making such crap in name of love stories.""Could have been a better movie if it would have not tangled with the history.This movie challenged the true story and history. It is accepted that Vlad was a ruthless warrior, but it is awful to show against one of the greatest emperor of all time Mehmat-al- fetih, who conquered the byzantine empire, in one of the epic battles of history, yet he gave freedom of religion in his new kingdom. Also the history shows that Mehmat-al- fetih died naturally much long after the death of Vlad (Dracula).Luke Evans is a good actor and I liked his work in the Hobbit series but not in this movie.He took the one of the character which history recognise as a negative one which this movie tried to show a sympathetic one by introducing his love for his child.""This is the most Awful movie i have ever seen. It was free for me on TataSky Showcase and I thought i will spend some time. But within 10 minutes i felt like vomiting. Worst movie i have ever tried to watch. Please do not waste your time on this ""Wahiyaat"" movie. No morals, no ethics. I wonder is the world really become this cheap watching this movie. No story. Only beautiful faces. Few decent songs. Thats all. Dialogues are just picked up from various old Hindi movies. If Karan johar did not knew how to fill the movie with when there was no script he took the crew to different European locations and made the actors dance to old Hindi movie songs. Please avoid this movie. If you want to watch it watch it at your own risk. Bollywood can't stoop more lower than this.""Movie is so retarded and very boring. It's not even funny only dumb people will find it funny and also the kid is annoying. He's not even funny and forcing people to run by calling them a chicken they won't even allow that in a real league. Also they wouldn't let the kid to annoy a pitcher to make him throw the ball at the base and stalling the game. Another retarded part is when the pitcher throws the ball at the base when the annoying kid wouldn't shut up and when he threw the ball it was obvious that there was a delay in it between shots of the scene. In real life it wouldn't take more than a second for the ball to reach the base. The kid is lame he's not even funny whatsoever only retards will find it funny or people who doesn't know about editing and delays. Daniel stern is the only funny actor in this movie especially home alone series. I'm so thankful this kid wasn't as Kevin but being abuse by family would be funny. You also don't get super strength after getting your cast off, in fact I know 7 people who had to cast their arm and when it healed it didn't give them strength proving this movie is extremely fake.""Am I the only one in this world who has the ability to see (in this film and in many other films) an extremely crappy and forced acting, crappy dialogues, crappy script, crappy directing, crappy pacing and overall crappy execution.
There is no difference if you compare this soap-opera-melodrama film to any other latino telenovela. No difference whatsoever. Its the same poor production, the same robotic and over the top acting, the same forced emotions and dialogues, the same boring mumbling jumbling scenes, etc.
All the actors are just terrible and they are overacting so badly. The only one redeeming thing about this crappy film is the young boy and he is the only one who knows how to act.
Here is my advice for all of you people, don't waste your time on this extremely overrated crappy-boring film.""Farhan and Raju are eager to reunite with their college friend Rancho. They find Chatur instead who have worked hard to brag about his success since his challenge 10 years ago. They go off in search for Rancho but there's a secret. In flashbacks, they are freshmen as mechanical engineering students. Rancho refuses to submit to hazing from upperclassmen and the dictatorial teaching methods of Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe. Rancho's rebellious nature win over Farhan and Raju. He rails against Virus' pressure after a student's suicide. He falls for Virus' daughter Pia.
I don't think Rancho works completely. He's too perfect like a mythical creature. He's a magical nerd. The movie needs to build up this high pressure world a lot better before it can tear it down. I can guess at what this movie is striving for but I don't see it as funny or compelling. There is also a great twist in the middle and one at the end which is easily foreseeable from a mile away. The middle twist should be a better exposition. There should be a better story and a better journey to find Rancho. Ultimately, I don't think this speaks to me although it might be lost in translation.""The quality of Netflix original movies ranges from total garbage (Adam Sandler / Kevin James stuff) to surprisingly good (e.g. 'The Fundamentals of Caring'). 'Take the 10' lies somewhere in between. It features a creative non-linear storyline and some funny moments though it never feels like a good movie on the whole.
The tone of the film could be referred to as half-realistic. At root it's a 'this-really-could-happen-to-anybody' kind of movie yet it features some really unlikely coincidences in order to keep the story going. Sometimes it tries too hard to be funny too and characters do awkward things that feel out of place for the audience.
The movie has a thick plot and many characters, which are all interconnected in a rather smooth way (except aforementioned coincidences). It shows the struggles of everyday people trying to get along and overcome the challenges life poses. In that aspect (and that aspect only) it reminded me a bit of a Coen Bros film.
'Take the 10' also features some moments where it clearly tries to be social commentary yet everything's a little bit too vague and random to give the movie real substance or depth. In short, it's not funny enough to be a good comedy and not substantial enough to be more than a comedy.
This movie's strong suit is its complex plot and many characters that are decent fun to follow. As a whole though it's rather hollow and insignificant. Moreover the ending is plain and foreseeable. All in all, not a bad yet slightly subpar flick. That's what the 4/10 category was invented for.""Having just read the book for a book group, I looked forward to this. To describe it as a travesty would be too kind.
I realise that films can't treat books literally, that they need to translate literary effects into cinematic ones, but this isn't the problem here. Rather it's that the subtleties of the book are ignored by a film which tramples on them with jackboots and despoils the central relationship for no obvious reason. It's a cruel insult to the grace and candour of Irene Nemirovsky, who died in Auschwitz without finishing what might have been the greatest novel of the twentieth century.
Read the book instead.""If you like the other two films in the trilogy you'll like 'Shaun of the Dead'. If you didn't, you won't. In all honesty it's as simple as that really
There' a very thin story in place, but really the strength of the film is the interaction between Pegg, Frost and co as they battle seemingly endless undead zombies.
Bill Nighy pops up and steals the film as ever, and he is one of the many famous faces that appear here along the way.
'Hot Fuzz' is probably the best of the trilogy, but there is a lot to like about this film.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Piece of CRAP..I wish there was a minus rating in IMDb... I had expectations for reeves but seriously I can't believe this. Come on man the movie was just one and half hours and you guys could have extended it to 2.15 hrs at least and made some sense to this crap movie. Wasted 1.30 hrs of my life why on earth did the movie had five production company The movie was pointless and it requires a better ending at least. The movie had its own style but he should have done something or there should have been a better reason for such a behavior of the girls. No one would run for a statue when someone is tied up and shouting for help.
Knock knock is a movie with a screwed up ending that ruined the whole movie in total and killed everyone's expectations.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I don't want to say that this is the worst movie of all time, however, it may be the most overrated movie of all time. This is considered a masterpiece by many. It is definitely a piece...
Starting with the first 15 minutes of the film (I'm estimating on time by the way), you will just be assaulted by ear splitting sounds of primates, which are supposed to be primitive humans, just screaming at each other and fighting. it adds nothing to the film and is incredibly irritating.
the next 10 minutes of the film entails a group of scientists researching the black monolith where you will experience another 5 minutes of ear splitting sounds. I am not exaggerating on how annoying a lot of the sounds are. I have actually had to mute the TV.
then we move on to the part of the movie where the plot is actually represented. we are sitting around for about an hour and a half watching the progression of HALs breakdown. this part of the movie is actually tolerable, it's just an hour longer than it needs to be. I feel like I'm just waiting and waiting for 90% of the movie for something to actually happen. the film leaves you feeling absolutely no sympathy for the dead astronaut. eventually we are left for ourselves to decide whether HAL actually broke down or if he was programmed to kill the astronauts.
If you thought the first 2 hours couldn't get any more long, boring and irritating, you would be dead wrong - if you haven't already died of boredom that is.
When the survivor makes it to the escape pod, the movie actually manages to get even worse. not just a little bit worse, but so bad that by the end of the movie I was in tears from witnessing one of the worse films ever made. Anyway, for about 10 minutes straight, we see the survivor traveling through space with colors passing him as he stares out with this dumb, unchanging look on his face with more unnecessary noises. my impression of the colors were that he was looking up at an apartment building and a flustered artist from the top floor was raging and decided to throw all his paint out of the window, which happened to fall all around the survivor. That, or he was on the most severe drug trip in history.
From there he suddenly ends up in some nicely furnished house where he sees himself as an old man eating dinner, then later as an even older man on his deathbed, then as an unborn baby looking down at Earth. Film ends. WHAT!?!? Is the audience actually supposed to be satisfied with that or see some kind of message in it?
I cannot express enough how much I hated this movie. I am a grown man and I literally cried at the end of the 2 and a half hours of a cinematic abomination i had just endured. While I will admit the camera work and special effects were phenomenal, that alone cannot make up everything else that was placed into a blender then thrown into the theaters.
Stanley Kubrick is a legendary film maker and has done some beautiful work in many of his other movies, but 2001: A Space Oddysey is just an insult to anyone who watches it. I wanted to like this movie, I truly did, there is just nothing that made me think for a second that this movie deserves anything nicer to say than 'a piece of garbage.'""The key thing to understand about GLORY is that it is not really about the Civil War, or slavery, or ""the Black Experience in America."" What it really explores is the modern American liberal's fear and guilt, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights movement and the racial violence that followed in the NINETEEN Sixties, as opposed to the EIGHTEEN Sixties.
Notice how the most dangerous and threatening black man in the story is called ""Trip."" As in, I dropped acid and had a Bad Trip, man. Denzel Washington's character acts and talks nothing like a runaway slave. He's a frightened white liberal's resentful caricature of a Nineteen Sixties Black Panther. All of Trip's rage is presented as selfish, childish, and destructive . . . until the wise and all- knowing black father figure sets him straight. The idea that everything would be okay in the black community if black fathers would just lay down the law is a standard evasion (or cop out) that has been around for fifty years.
Meanwhile, Matthew Broderick is riotously miscast as a seasoned military commander. This performance was so truly awful it became a punch line for years. Yet Broderick's reaction to his black costars (terror and revulsion barely veiled by condescending good will) was really an uncannily accurate portrait of a modern, upper class white liberal's reaction to dealing with black people up close. The real Robert Gould Shaw wouldn't have been intimidated by his own troops, because he didn't have the same level of guilt as a modern liberal, or the same intense awareness of his own hypocrisy. The fear on Matthew Broderick's face is so real it's like he's not even acting! And that's just the point. He's playing his terror, his guilt, not Robert Gould Shaw's. He looks like a white college kid who gets locked in a drunk tank in a big city jail and is about to have his watch taken. The real Robert Gould Shaw was a very different man with a very different view of himself . . . one no modern liberal can really understand, since it was based on a form of Christian faith and American patriotism that has long since vanished from the earth. Or at least from Hollywood and most of the better college campuses.
So what can you say about GLORY? That it fails to evoke its own era, but reveals far more than it intends to about ours. The battle scenes never seem real, but Matthew Broderick appears truly shell shocked every time Denzel Washington looks him in the eye with open scorn and contempt.
It's too bad neither of them are acting!""*** This review may contain spoilers *** First of all some figures: The Hateful Eight cost $44m to make and in six months had made $145m - over three times as much. Those are the kind of figures producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein like, and while Quentin keeps the box office cash tills ringing, Bob and Harvey, or whoever else Quentin approaches with his latest script, will carry on saying 'yes, Quentin, of course, Quentin, and can I get you another olive for your martini, Quentin?' His previous two stinkers also made a lot of loot: Django Unchained cost $100m and pretty soon returned $425m worldwide; Inglorious Basterds cost $75m and soon brought in $321m worldwide).
Admittedly, those $145m came from someone's pockets, so someone and their friends must like the kind of cack Quentin has been turning out remorselessly since the very good Reservoir Dogs and good, though, not great Pulp Fiction. And you can't argue with such cash figures, you'll be saying. Well, if that's your line, let me remind you of the wisdom to 'eat sh*t, seven trillion flies can't be wrong'. Oh, yes they can.
Elsewhere on this site you will find The Hateful Eight lauded to high heaven and given superlative ratings. But you will also see very low ratings and criticism of various kinds. My advice: ignore the fanboys who might well enjoy gratuitous blood and gore as much as our Quentin. Go by what the naysayers have to say. Despite some initial great photography - not Quentin's department though - this is pretty dire.
To be fair, I don't think The Hateful Eight is quite as bad as Django Unchained, although it, too, has seams of bargain basement political correctness about race and colour running through it of the kind which is actually just as insulting to blacks. But it also has the same faults: an artlessly contrived plot, a horribly uneven pace, superficially clever dialogue which actually sounds only like superficially clever dialogue and an awfully stagey direction.
The Hateful Eight, in fact, comes across as a ham mystery play transferred to the screen by someone who has no idea that film has its own imperatives. Heresy? The boy Quentin doesn't know about film, I say. Well, on the evidence of this flat-footed effort, he certainly seems to have forgotten whatever you insist he once knew.
Quentin also manages to elicit from a respectable line-up of actors some pretty wooden performances: they all, even Mr Samuel Jackson, one of my favourite actors, come across as speaking lines from someone's smart script. They all seem to be acting, sometimes acting well, but still acting, and only the director, one Quentin Tarantino, can be blamed for that. He might know how to put together a bloodfest gunfight, but he often seems clueless as to how to give his actors directions.
Other reviews such as this one have tended to mention historical inaccuracies and other infelicities. I was surprised to hear one character describe another as 'paranoid' - what, in mid-19th century Wyoming? I don't think so. But my gripes have nothing really much to do with that.
My gripes have to do with the boy Quentin's filmmaking: he's just not as good as he obviously thinks he is. Not by a long chalk. The characters are stock characters, most of the films consists of series of one-to-one setpieces and his convoluted plots are only convoluted because that is Quentin's schtick.
In The Hateful Eight he even pulls a fast one: two-thirds of the way through we get a narration and a very hamfisted new element is introduced to get the ball rolling again. It's as though busily writing his script he had reached a kind of dead end and didn't quite know where to go next.
What Quentin needs is someone to tell him 'this just isn't very good, laddie, try again'. But while those cash tills keep a'ringin that really isn't going to happen.
The film is almost two and a half hours long, and I wanted to give up after an hour. I only kept going because I knew I would be writing this review, and it was only fair I saw the lot. On the other hand, if you want to give up after an hour, by all means do so. You will really not miss much at all and might even find something more useful to do. And you will even not have to witness a particularly unpleasant scene where a woman is hanged.
By the way: just how did two badly injured men, one of whom couldn't move at all, the other just revived from a fainting fit but who could also barely move manage to rustle up a hanging rope complete with a very professional noose from somewhere and get the hanging done? Oh, and if you do give up - as I advise - you will also be spared a particularly mawkish, not to say dishonest epilogue involving a letter apparently written by Abraham Lincoln to the black character. Oh dear.""Here i am, just watching for some good movie to watch. And i run across this one in one of the topics on Facebook. God, who forced me too look this? 3AM, a lonely girl(me) and the movie that can't be less scary or more dumb. I am very disappointed. Trailer was good, the beginning was good. But the point of the story? Three year old kid wouldn't get scared! Gosh, Hollywood producers, get some imagination! A complete failure. Actors are miserable, Bram's story is incomplete,his character is so weak,Cole's character is lame, Malcolm is a pussy, and this main role, whatever her name is, has no enough emotions for this kind of situation. All in all, a complete mess. I thought that i will give it 2 votes because of the good camera angles and quality, but i changed my mind considering that it's 21st century and that quality should be conceivable. Do not waste your time!""For reasons unexplained, there was a decision to create some bizarre, totally out of place, religious Jewish Russian mafia. Having worked with some of them during my day job, the depiction of these Jewish villains was so pitiful bad that it immediately removed me from the movie. It could have been decent if pains weren't made to create such an artificial and unbelievable gang, complete with Yarmulkas. And then there is the denigration of blacks by these Jews and more I won't describe.
Great cast. Strange story that is not believable, straight from the opening. A film has to be plausible in order to be accepted by the audience. But how would anyone believe the opening scene and the repercussions of greed which didn't translate into an immediate problem? This film doesn't even bother with making sure that those covering up a crime *wear gloves* when committing crimes in places they shouldn't be.
The depiction of Hispanic people in Atlanta was also hilariously way over the top. Religious Jews are disgusting, disgraceful, racist people and Hispanics are all a bunch of ego driven mindless dumb thugs.
Whomever was responsible for this mess and clearly anti-Semitic priority should have been tarred and feathered for wasting a good cast of actors. They should have paid more attention to tightening up a very loose script instead of creating even more outrageous stereotypes.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Okay, I need someone to explain this to me...
I've never played the games, read the books or watched the movie series. I decided to Marathon the entire movie series before watching The Final Chapter. This entire series had weak acting, cheesy action, cliché plots and flaws all around. This, I'm okay with and I am used to, and I've never took it as a serious franchise.
This particular film however was a complete mess with inconsistencies. Had me saying 'What?' a dozen times before eventually just getting bored and rolling with it. Here's a few questions..
1) How is Wesker alive? He blew up in 'Afterlife.' 2) How is Wesker human again? He was infected and all messed up. 3) How does the real Alice know sign language? And why? 4) What was the point of Sign language if everyone spoke in the film...? Including the fake girl and fake Alice mother? 5) Why was Alice in that facility if the Red Queen wanted her dead? 6) How did the Red Queen take control of Umbrella Corp? Since when?? 7) Why the random puzzled plot? It doesn't fit with the rest of the series?? 8) Why the familiar faces of the previously deceased? Are they clones? Why them?? 9) Was Jill a clone or was she real?
The list can go on... this entire film had me question what was going on and who was who. This is probably the first time I ever felt like a series is genuinely being MILKED for money and business. People say it all the time, but this...? Yeah, now I'm a believer of that saying. The plots are inconsistent with one another and feel like they're running out of ideas.""If you are a bad movie enthusiast, then this lemon is a must-see addition to your collection of painful experiences. This is the worst Dreamworks movie ever made. That is the only reason to watch it. So that you can say you have seen the very worst. It has the darkest, most depressing characters and story, and the most adult themes of any Dreamworks movie, including murder, torture, and rape. What were they thinking? Did they forget that these movies are supposed to be for children? And it is painfully inaccurate, historically, including many debunked myths about Egyptian culture and the building of the pyramids. It seems that Dreamworks got food poisoning, but kept working anyway, and this garbage is the result.""This movie was TERRIBLE the only reason I had nightmares that night was because of how satanic the movie was. it is disgusting, and there was no point to it, except to show a satanic surgeon, stitching people's mouthes to their anuses. therefore making thee person behind get nutrition by eating the next person's feces... Guess I could also say it was a 'crappy' movie.
and it was not scary at all, but extremely satanic. I advise you not to watch this movie, if you have a weak stomach, or you don't like demented things. if you are a sadist you'll enjoy it, but otherwise, you will want to throw up all day long. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE. I repeat, DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I watched this movie last night without any idea what it would be about, other than there would be a good dinosaur. I'm sorry, but this movie was so try hard. Trying to follow in the great footsteps of The Lion King, it just fell flat, as all copy cats will do.
Watching Arlo running around with his father in the field at night made me instantly think of the Lion King, and expect that the dad will die in the next scene. The next scene they're out in the storm, the father, climbing rocks slips and falls to be carried away, not by a stampede, but a raging torrent, the stampede was later, after Arlo was trying to roar on a rock, then had to hide behind it, so as to not be hurt by the stampede.
No, the story wasn't the same, but it was so obviously borrowing scenes from the great Lion King, and this made it trite.
I also can't believe the drug references and the fact cute animals got eaten and torn to shreds. The animation would suggest they're aiming at really tiny kids, the acting would suggest definitely not. I later realised it was PG, it was just so ridiculously babyish of a movie apart from that, the cartooning, the characters, the really stupid story line that has been done s many times before.
One last criticism. Couldn't the writers take a little bit of time coming up with a way of life that wasn't 'red neck American' seriously? Ick. The only reason I decided to watch this movie was the fact it was Pixar. Oh Pixar, what has happened to you.""This movie looks like 4-5 postal cards glued together and sold at a tourists stand on a main street in some city of Europe. What is there besides the occasional nice imagery along with some catchy tracks? This movie is a text book cliché. Or is maybe that it touched many office workers trapped inside their cubicle. Let's see what these guys want the most... oh getting away from sitting in front of the computer and live some exciting life. Hollywood selling dreams since 1910. Not that dreaming isn't great, it's the selling thing that smells. Pretty close to that door sales man pitch.
Besides, like said it is a poor movie, there is no story, just a Mountain Film Festival kind of a script and even then we have to wait one hour for a few nice images to show up.
What now, are they going to project movies to make the cows forget they are trapped for life inside a massive farm? Wait, that may actually by a good idea.
As a side note, what is up with IMDb displaying by default the best reviews of a film? I mean, doesn't that make reading reviews subjective? What if I don't know there is a menu to display the reviews in chronological order? If a movie is poor and I read on the first page only the positive reviews, do I get the right impression on the film?""I attempted to watch this film yesterday on Sky. I couldn't even get to the end , it was THAT bad. I cannot believe that anyone who read this script would even have thought this would make a good movie. It appears to have been written by a 10 year old boy, as that's the level of the ""humour"" though I can't honestly bring myself to call it that. And to read that the budget for this was £35 million - outrageous. The scene with the elephants was one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The use of the word ""grim"" in the title has to be deliberate,surely. For grim it is. I cannot for the life of me understand how this has gotten any good reviews""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Rogue One opens up to a rainy scene, grassland plains between rolling hills, with a little girl running in the mud. She goes home to her parents and her father who tells her ""it's time"". This episode in the Star Wars franchise started out as any other. I was expecting a movie with the same plot lines, and typical characters without any depth. But I was surprised by the Star Wars movie. We open up to a seven of the girl years later, after her mother has been killed, and her. Father has been taken by the Empire. She manages to escape an Empire truck with the help of the resistance. She learns that her father is with the Empire against his will, making plans for the Death Star, which the resistance is trying to obtain. And thus begins the mission of movie. At points in Rogue One there is some tension between the characters, which lead to these sad backstory type sentimental lines, which don't really work for the movie. But these moments don't take away from the plot line. From the star of the movie comparisons can be seen between the markets of different planets and the Syria/Middle East conflict. The Empire can be seen on the planet, with their big militarized trucks mining and looting special crystals from temples to use to power the Death Star. They're going through the busy streets, storm troopers following behind. Then gunfire erupts as a rebel group starts to shoot at the trucks. The storm troopers fight back with large army robots and grenades, all the while civilians re caught in the crossfire. The girl, Jyn, fights with resistance member Cassian, who kills another member of a different rebellion. They are captured and taken back to their base, which turns out to be led by Jyn's uncle who raised her after her father was captured. Jyn is reunited with her uncle who she's not too pleased to see after he abandoned her. He apologizes saying it was necessary to save her, after which they make plans to take the Death Star plans. Jyn is joined by a reverse team of resistance fighters. The ending scene of rogue one seems very much like a war scene. Bombs are being thrown as imperial walkers crush the land, and by the end, all of the main characters are killed, a first for a Star Wars movie. One of the reasons the episode stands out against all the others is was because of how much more realistic it was (well, as realistic as a Star Wars movie can get. In the end, you see Cassian and Jyn struggle to the shore of a beach, all of the comrades dead, their mission a success, they collapse onto the sand as the death ray blasts the planet into oblivion.""An overall 7.2 rating? What a commentary on popular taste.
This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. There was, after all, Plan Nine from Outer Space, Lost Horizon (1973), Pi, Lady in a Cage, and other assorted atrocities. But it definitely is in the neighborhood.
If this an example of this Shyamalan fellow's supposed genius, I am decidedly unimpressed.
Let's start with the pacing, which is on the level of watching paint dry or corn grow. Then there is the central plot idea, which goes way beyond suspension of disbelief. The concept is just simply preposterous.
Bruce Willis appears to have been sedated. Samuel Jackson does the best he can with the ridiculous lines he must read. And as far as the supposed ""surprise ending,"" give me a break, please. And the phony closing wrapups which try to make us believe this really happened, puh-leeeez.
Fortunately I had nothing better to do during the time I watched this dog, otherwise I'd be looking for a way to get my 106 minutes back.""This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. We were with another couple and they wanted to leave after about 40 minutes. We convinced them to stay but probably shouldn't have. We kept thinking it must get better - but sadly no. As others have commented, the acting was poor, possibly due to the incredibly idiotic story line. The dancing looked like a high school music review, the singing - lets just say if you slept through it you were blessed. How this movie got so many awards is beyond me. I thought maybe it was my age. I called my millennial son who also watched it with his wife and they both agreed it was a poor movie.""This is THE worst crap I have seen probably ever. It has taken over as the worst movie I have personally seen....Ben Afflect/Gigli have now been replaced at the bottom. Sorry, it's not that I can't write more about why this movie is so pathetic, it's that I won't give it that satisfaction. Trying to save you peeps 2.67 hours of your life that you won't get back. AGH! Well, apparently, I have to post 10 lines to have this published on the site. So, as others have said this movie should baffle even the simplest logical spectator as these priests come up with some of the stupidest courses of action and illogical, trite conversations. Half way through the movie I told my friend that the rest of the movie could be amazing and it would still rank as one of the most terrible films currently playing.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** It seems like there are a wealth of animated talking animal movies these days. With Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks releasing 'Zootopia', 'The Good Dinosaur', 'Finding Dory' and 'Kung Fu Panda 3' recently, it only seems fair that Universal dipped their hands into the sub-genre as well with 'The Secret Life of Pets'. Universal's animation studio Illumination Entertainment brought us 'Despicable Me' and those darn 'Minions' to the big screen, which has made the entertainment business billions of dollars. It seems logical for the studio to cash in on the talking animal genre now, since everyone else is doing it, however with an already over-crowded market for these films, 'The Secret Life of Pets' may fall short of beating out 'Zootopia' and 'Finding Dory' in both the financial and critical realms. I'm not saying that 'The Secret Life of Pets' is a bad movie or anything. In fact there are some great moments that are funny and charming, but it loses itself in the second half of the film when it becomes an action-caper movie that becomes over-the-top and even drags in its short run time of less than 90 minutes.
The film really succeeds when it shows just what are pets do when we humans leave for work in the morning and go out the door. The writers and director ('Despicable Me') sure had some clever and hilarious gags that showed the special nuances of our pets that all of us can relate to, but the story revolves around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier who has a great bond with his owner. All of that changes when his new owner brings home a new giant brown dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). These two dogs are basically the equivalent of Mike and Sully from 'Monster's Inc.' in both shape and personality. The two don't get along due to some jealousy issues, but the pair of dogs find themselves lost in the streets in a beautifully rendered Manhattan without collars, and are now on the run from the dog catchers as well as an underground animal rebellion known as the 'Flushed Pets', led by a psychotic ninja bunny rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart turned up to 11).
Max's pet friends try to search for him, including a ritzy and hopeless romantic Pomeranian (Jenny Slate), an obese house cat (Lake Bell), a hyperactive pug (Bobby Moynihan), a relaxed dachshund (Hannibal Buress), a tiny parakeet (Tara Strong), a confused Hawk (Albert Brooks), and a spry, old hound (Dana Carvey). Yes, there are too many characters here, and in fact, there are more in the film, which is one of its downfalls. There are just too many characters to juggle in this short time span and most characters just show up for a small amount of time for a few jokes and laughs, then basically disappear.
Again, the first half of the film is quite enjoyable with all of the quirks and actions of each pet getting laughs, however in the second half of the film, pets are driving human cars down the busy streets of New York and all come together in a 'Spider- Man' like scenario climax. Perhaps one of the best scenes in the film is when Max and Duke head to a hot dog factory that plays out like 'Grease' and early 40's musical movies. With most of the characters not getting enough time for care and the over- the-top action sequences once again, 'The Secret Life of Pets' becomes rather exhausting and most unfunny toward the end. Still, the film looks amazing visually with the ever so tall skyline of New York as seen through the eyes of our smaller furry friends and the score by Alexandre Desplat sounds excellent and has the Woody Allen New York vibe to it. The film is still mostly enjoyable and has some great comedic moments, but if it just stuck with a simpler story line, instead of turning into an action film, things would have flowed smoother.
WORTH A LOOK!""Well I was told before I watched this that it was a great movie. Not sure why anyone would call it that, it's anything but great. In fact I was bored during watching it and kept going to FB to see if there was anything interesting there to keep me awake.
The first mistake it makes is to cast Eddie Redmayne. I think he's one of the most over rated actors and constantly looks as if his mouth was frozen while saying ""Pork"". This means it's often difficult to understand what he's saying and I get tired of fighting to hear dialogue.
Effects are OK. sets great, dialogue poor, acting mostly average, direction average and ability to captivate very low. I will definitely not be checking out the rest of the movies in the pipeline and I wish I could reclaim the hours I wasted watching this.""i a writing this review just to get my voice out there about the problem with this film which many others agree with. this film shows how Disney is turning star wars into a money generating industry just like what has been done with marvel, they are all the same and people continue to watch them, the force awakens has demonstrated that they are willing to do the same. the movie is pretty much a new hope! it even has another death star! what were they thinking!, there is not one bit of originality in this film and it frustrates me. i mean on its own its a decent film but when you consider the past films and how this film has just copied them it just ruins the franchise. that is something that the prequels did well, although they weren't good movies from a character or story construction point of view they did do a good job of being original and fitting into the star wars universe, expanding the mythology and showing a time that was different to the original saga, the force awakens doesn't even do this, we are just thrown back into a situation where the empire is attacking again! there is nothing new. i hope i contribute to expressing the fan disappointment of this film""*** This review may contain spoilers *** The movie had some good parts; but over all poor character direction. for many characters to be military people they kept doing stupid things. The military training would never have them do such stupid actions. the scientist are suppose to be the smarter logical thinking people; but the act the most stupid. the writing has the characters not use any common sense. many character just start off with a personality with no history as to why they are that way, very confusing. they never really tell you why some characters are unique, they just are. the characters do things that would go against self survival for no reason. the ending has some cute points to it. all in all I did not like this movie it left me with a bad after thought of a waste of my time.""While browsing the movies at a local library, this one jumped out at me - psychedelic looking cover, big list of name actors on the front, interesting and plot blurb on the back...so I took a chance. And ended up wasting two and half hours watching what looked like an attempt to do a prequel to The Big Lebowski that went wrong in every way possible.
The film is based on a book, so I assume there was a plot buried in there somewhere under all the mumbled, slurred or whispered dialog, confusing and disconnected scenes that go nowhere and cardboard acting. The director must have realized that no one was going to be able to follow this, so he added a hippie astrologer chick as the narrator, but she's even more confusing and annoying than the movie she's trying to explain.
From the start I couldn't tell what was going on, and every time I felt like I might be starting to understand a bit of it, the plot (such as it was) would veer off in a completely different direction. When the thing finally ended, I had no idea what happened, I was just glad it was over.
It had something to do with a stoner detective named Doc living in the early 1970s. He gets tipped off about a missing millionaire real estate developer by his crazy ex-girlfriend. But then he is told about something called the ""Golden Fang"" by an Asian prostitute. But before he gets too deep into that, he is sidetracked by a supposedly dead jazz musician who turns out to be an unwilling FBI undercover agent. And there's a bitter police detective named Bigfoot who wants to be an actor and seems to get all his leads from Doc. None of this really adds up to a coherent story.
I have to give the movie credit for using some interesting music in the soundtrack (Can's ""Vitamin C"", Neil Young's ""Journey Through the Past"", etc). Some of the performances are good like Josh Brolin as Bigfoot, and occasionally Joaquin Phoenix as Doc, when he's not mugging for the camera. There were a couple laughs, although most of the attempts at humor fall pretty flat.
Overall recommendation: avoid. There are far better ways you could waste two and a half hours of your life.""Hi folks.
Don't even bother with this one.
Possibly one of the worst films ever made. The plot is full of clichés and hence unpredictable from the offset. It seems these days millions of $$$ are spent on beautiful camera work and scenery, yet all for a plot which is diabolical.
The script seems to overload the viewer with personal background information such a teenage moods etc, instead of getting on with the impetus of the story.
I only watched this thru because I wanted to see Elizabeth Shue in another setting (as I have only ever seen her in 'CSI Vegas').
This is NOT a HORROR film (as it's description implies!) but a very light and tamed GHOST story.
Might suit a young teenager audience with very limited knowledge or lack of insight into this films genre.
A complete waste of time and money.
Hope this helps . . .
Best.
Paul David Seaman (UK)""The Thing, the 1982 film by John Carpenter came highly recommended from several close film sources in which I trust. It is a horror movie, it's directed by a horror master, what's not to love for a fan of the genre. No one was more surprised than me that The Thing couldn't even hold my attention, necessitating 3 viewings before I could complete it. Mental note: if you fall asleep during a movie not once, but twice, it just may not be the film experience for you. I persevered, however, because I truly thought I would appreciate the film. The film stars Carpenter's most often collaborator, Kurt Russell as a researcher stationed in Antarctica that is suddenly impacted by an alien life form. A seemingly engaging premise left a lackadaisical impression and further left me with the idea that I may not like John Carpenter as much as I thought I did.
During the first ****amn week of winter, a team of American explorers in Antarctica are shocked to find their base being swarmed by a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby base. When the helicopter crashes, the American team goes to investigate only to discover everyone at the base dead or missing. The team does find something of interest, however, when they happen upon the burned remains of an unidentified creature. The team gathers the charred remains, and take it to the base with them where they deduce that it is an alien life form. The most shocking aspect of the remains are that the creature can assimilate into any lifeform it inhabits, and it inhabits like a virus, easily spreading to person to person. The implications of this discovery mean that any member of the team may be inhabited by The Thing, creating tension between the group as they each struggle to distinguish between the unaffected members and the ones The Thing has taken over.
I don't even know where to start here. I'm not typically a science fiction fan, and this film had a much more sci-fi than horror feel to it. As far as Carpenter's other work goes, I've only seen Halloween and Big Trouble in Little China, hardly enough examples to lay blame with the director. The narrative seemed to rely largely on an ominous feeling that was never properly established. Maybe my main qualm lies with the poor title. I do know that this film is a remake, I have never seen the 1951 original, but in Carpenter's film, I never knew what I was supposed to be scared of. A shapeshifting organelle that inhabits its host without them knowing is a good premise for a fearful mood, but it never materialized as such for me. There seemed to be several opportunities for more (or better) scares that were not seized upon. I'm so disheartened to learn that the directors I thought I enjoyed were really just responsible for one or two films that I enjoyed rather than the director himself. Wes Craven immediately comes to mind as I have now seen a few of his films, none of which replicating the magic of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, for me. Of course, I must see more of Carpenter's work before writing him off, but The Thing isn't the film to convince me to put any of his films at the top of my watchlist.""Let's be honest, with a movie made by the Coen brothers comes expectations. This movie fails mightily in regards to those expectations. Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautifully shot and Brolin is solid as always in the lead. The problem with this movie is a horribly undeveloped plot and characters that are never developed or really significant at all to the story. You see this big name cast advertised, but for no reason whatsoever. Outside of Brolin and Clooney, practically no other characters are on screen for more than a couple of minutes, or are relevant to the story. Scarlett Johansson is completely irrelevant to the story, as is Channing Tatum. Jonah Hill phones in a bit part that had no point in even existing. The only supporting actor that really shines in their brief time on screen is Alden Ehrenreich, who is terrific. Sadly, he is introduced and then exits just as fast. This was a halfhearted effort by two very talented but bored filmmakers. They really did not have an idea for a complete movie, just a neat idea for a skit, a skit with no legs. I am a huge Coen fan, but this was pretentious and a waste of time..""Pretty superficial and disappointing bombast kitsch. Very weak script without deeper explored characters and plausible relationship patterns. Instead we see a lot of CGI fire magic and long shots of Jolie performing her usual meaningful but stereotypical expressions. The film lacks the real magical charm like in the Czech fairy tale films of the 60s and 70s, that is unfortunately generally very rare in modern US productions (exception f.e. 'Legend'). But Maleficient is quite cheap CGI Hocus-Pocus and far from being a magical experience that it should be. With that budget, the right script and a fresh acting talent you could make a fantastic movie that would last long in the hearts (f.e. like the original 'Oz'). Has Hollywood definitely forgotten how to create magic apart special effects?""Now, there has been many a time friends and myself have ridiculed certain films envisioning a comical or spoof version, even films we adore. Sacha Baron Cohen writes a story that's precisely that. What if James Bond had that annoying, beyond stupid brother that just ruins every moment they share.
Action director Louis Leterrier who's best work would be Statham vehicle, The Transporter, MCU's Incredible Hulk and the first Now You See Me, actually puts his skill into play here creating some clever action sequences. In particular, Mark Strong's character introduction which even though feels like a cheap copy of Hardcore Henry's POV style, it's actually very well done and entertaining, but then it should be no surprised that Hardcore Henry's creator and director Ilya Naishuller served as a consultant for that very sequence.
Mark Strong plays the super spy, special agent Sebastian Graves, oozing finesse, control and confidence where he's reunited with his lost lost older brother Grimsby's very own Nobby, played by Cohen. I would like to say he's the village idiot but it seems the town's complete population is of the same caliber.
The plot makes good for stupid antics however, most are not that funny and are probably for an acquired taste of comedy. Cohen's makes good use of each comical opportunity, imagining what would an idiot do if they suddenly became a secret agent.
I have no idea why Penélope Cruz would take such a part but she's does a terrible job. Isla Fisher is understandable, being Cohen's wife and Rebel Wilson is exactly who you expect.
Films seem to allowing a lot of unnecessary genitalia scenes, but it's just uncouth but I suppose it has the desired affect. (Edit: Not the most uncouth filthy film of 2016, nothing's gonna quite top Sausage Party)
Unfortunately, as much as Cohen is talented and funny, often pushing the comic boundaries far and beyond inappropriate, it's fairly awful and not one of his best. Strong is actually really good and can't imagine how hard it must have been starring opposite Cohen.
Some people should find this film hilarious, but it did nothing for me apart from make me cringe and be semi-impressed with Graves' introduction.

37% 4/10""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I don't know what i just watched but it sure as hell didn't deserve the 8/10 rating it has currently has on IMDb. In short there is no main story, almost everything is left to your own imagination.There are a ton of story lines but they don't give any answers and don't lead anywhere.
It blows my mind that this movie is being rated as a masterpiece, in my opinion it was utter garbage.
Did i already mention i did not enjoy this movie?
1/10 and that's being generous
x""John Landis is a name associated with comedy. He wrote or directed some of the greatest comedies ever made, two of them (""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"") in the two years preceding ""An American Werewolf in London."" So it's no surprise that ""American Werewolf"" threw his fans for a loop with its intense moments of horror and gore, but also no surprise that it's ridiculously silly.
The horror-comedy hybrid is more commonplace today, 35 years after the release of ""An American Werewolf in London"" (not to mention a little horror film called ""The Evil Dead""). Back then, horror comedies were just horror movies that were so bad they were funny, so to have a movie with such strikingly horrific images interlaced with raunchy comedy was a shock to the system. Today, that juxtaposition is what little value exists in watching ""American Werewolf.""
Nothing can take away makeup effects artist Rick Baker's groundbreaking work on this film transforming the main character, David, into a werewolf, and its much-deserved first-ever Best Makeup Oscar, but the technology is all in service of an aimless story.
Two young men, David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne) are backpacking in northern England when they are attacked by a werewolf. David wakes up in a hospital in London, where he starts to have violent hallucinatory dreams and is warned that during the next full moon, he'll turn into a werewolf, wreaking havoc on innocent souls. Much of the story is us waiting for David to turn into a werewolf, and the rest is waiting for the inevitably conclusion to his predicament. In the meantime, his nurse (Jenny Agutter) falls for him and his doctor goes off in search of the truth.
The makeup, the horror sequences, the discomfort of Naughton running around naked and a werewolf attack in a porno theater  they're all either impressive or quirky bright spots for fans of genre films, but Landis strings them together using the bare minimum of what constitutes a story. He knows what scenes and moments he wants to punctuate ""American Werewolf,"" but the plot moves between them without any discernible reason.
There's good stuff in the movie, but the moments can't carry the dead weight. Landis has good horror instincts as best demonstrated by the subway chase and a wry sense of humor when it comes to ironic moon-themed songs and violence as seen in the climax in Piccadilly Circus, but the gaps in the story are filled with comedy, which confines the horror to just a handful of spots in the film. There's no suspense or sense of dread. This isn't to suggest Landis magically be Hitchcock, but too much of the film languishes or feels relevant to neither the comedy nor the horror.
""An American Werewolf in London"" will always have a spot in the pantheon of horror movie history for its innovations and for spurring a genre renaissance in the '80s, but of Landis' catalogue, it makes the list of notable films, not timeless ones.

Thanks for reading!Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more""I don't know if it's the fact that I'm watching this for the first time as a 30-something year old, but honestly, I tried so hard but couldn't make it through more than a hour of this movie. The main character, Chihiro (Sen) is so annoying, I almost turned off the movie after the first 10 minutes. I watched the English version, which, may or may not have something to do with how I felt about almost all of the characters in the movie. I've seen a few reviews which rave about what a masterpiece this movie was, but seriously, even after reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was so glad that I decided to give up and stop watching after an hour. In the end, it seems, there is no redemption for the main character. I was hoping for a metaphor or some deeper meaning, but I can't find a purpose for any of the characters or their actions. Like all Miyazaki anime, the animation is beautiful, but I've seen more beautiful anime in later years as technology has gotten better. I hate my first review on IMDb to be a negative one, but honestly, I love anime, and this is one of the classics, so I was shocked at how bad it was to me.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Just read jared-andrews2357's review he says it all. One could see this m movie as a critique to cults in general, but if so, it was done really poorly.. In general a very predictable and irritating movie, that's trying to be deeper than it really is and fails to deliver in all aspects. There are things happening all around our guests, but no one seems to notice except from our protagonist who is in grief. All the other ""normal"" guests are the stupidest people that could exist.
*spoilers*
Most suicide cults ask for consent. It is still a sick and criminal thing to do. Here we have no consent but only 4 people who want to die and decide to take their friends with them. We have no other explanation than ""we went to Mexico and met this Dr. something and he showed us the way out of our grief. We get no retort from the people who want to live. No judgment. They actually help the grieving mother who decided to kill them all gladly to fulfill her last will and ""go outside"" without any hesitation. Seriously? All of them? Even Kira who just met her that day and almost died because of her? People react so purely and unrealistically in this movie, except from the first woman who just left (most of us would have had either that reaction, or would have prepared ourselves for at least an orgy after that ""game""). The only reaction that Prouit gets after saying that he killed his wife (and only got 5 or 7 years of prison for some reason, though that just might be USA's legal system I have no idea) is a ""what the f@ck"". The only thing you can actually sympathize with in this movie is Wills reaction when he starts yelling at everyone that ""this doesn't feel safe"". Lastly, why in the end they show that this was an all around town phenomenon? They supposedly all met in Mexico and created the cult. Did all of them live in L.A or was this a national wide phenomenon? Why show it just to impress us and not give us answers? This is the most irritating thing about this movie, it's constantly presenting us things that make no sense and doesn't even try to justify them. It goes from ""Pain is a chemical reaction which can be controlled and ignored"" to ""I' ll just kill all my friends (for no apparent reason) and myself"" without any steps in between. This is actually pretty insulting to grieving people who struggle, even to people with attempted suicides, but that's beside the point.
*end of spoilers*
Long story sort, don't watch this movie it will just irritate you if you 're looking for anything that makes sense or provides you with food for thought.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Trying to modernise a well loved story/classic film is fraught with danger.
If you change things you are damned for changing. If you keep things the same you are damned by comparison to the 'classic' versions that have gone before.
This film fails on both levels.
Setting it in modern times makes you cringe with embarrassment.
Acting kids always have that smiley theatre trained over confident, precocious totally unreal 'fake' sound and look, which is pretty much standard for a group of kids, particularly in a musical. In this offering they actually reach a new level of annoyance.
But you can excuse the kids, because the adults are so so much worse.
Cameron Diaz cannot act - it was pitiful.
Do not waste your time watch this film, you will never get that 2 hours of your life back. You have been warned.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** Films about musicians or painters are usually problematic because the artist in question might have produced a great body of work but the events of their biography might not be inherently dramatic. Copying Beethoven is no exception. The scenarists here relied on the invention of a fictional character, Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger), who plays a young copyist to Beethoven in 1824, right before the great composer finished composing his famed 9th Symphony.
Holtz lives with her aunt, a mother superior at a convent, but is also an unlikely student at a music academy (the idea that a woman living in Vienna in the early part of the 19th century would have been permitted to study at such an all-male institution is an anachronistic conceit indeed). Nonetheless, Holtz suddenly appears at Beethoven's apartment and immediately shows great promise copying Beethoven's notes from his almost illegible manuscripts.
Ed Harris plays Beethoven as you might expect: a curmudgeon of sorts due to his encroaching deafness and general gruffness of personality. Some critics have faulted Harris for hamming things up a bit too much, especially in regards to Beethoven's irritability and overbearing demeanor. Nonetheless, it's not Harris' performance that really does the film in but rather a lack of a developed plot and certifiable antagonist.
Early on Beethoven's nephew Carl is introduced; he turns out to be a ne'er-do-well, stealing money from his uncle despite Beethoven's incessant support. While Carl is based on a real person, he soon drops out of the action and is replaced by Beethoven's deafness as an internal antagonist/obstacle. Most of the critical acclaim for this film revolves around the scene of Beethoven conducting the first performance of the 9th Symphony, supported by Anna, hidden on stage silently providing the conductor's movements, as Beethoven is unable to hear anything. Director Agnieszka Holland lamely keeps cutting back and forth between Anna and Beethoven and the entire scene becomes heavily repetitious, despite the beauty of the soundtrack.
Still searching for an antagonist, Holland finally settles on Anna's betrothed, Martin Bauer, an aspiring engineer, who enters a bridge-building competition. Beethoven, who senses Bauer is up to no good with Anna, destroys the model bridge right before the competition gets underway. Anna is first upset with Beethoven, but soon realizes he was right along about Bauer.
Before the final scene with Beethoven on his deathbed, the grumpy genius makes fun of Anna's composing abilities, making farting sounds as he plays Anna's work on the piano. Eventually he shows up at the convent and begs her forgivenessand ends up agreeing to collaborate with Anna, in order to improve the piece.
Ultimately Holland and her scenarists' use of a fictional character to enhance the drama doesn't quite come off. As a primer on Beethoven's last years and his music, Copying Beethoven passes muster in a basic way. Just don't expect any real fireworks here.""In the ancient Kingdom of Mahishmati in India, Sivagami, the queen (Ramya Krishnan), emerges from a cave adjoining a big waterfall, carrying a baby. She kills the soldiers pursuing her and sacrifices herself to save the baby. Local tribal communities save the baby and tribal queen adopts him. She also gives him name 'Shiva'.
Shiva (Prabhas) grows up to be a strong young man aspiring to hike the mountain and makes many unsuccessful attempts at it. He then finds a mask of a girl which falls from the waterfall. Driven to find out the identity of the girl, he climbs the mountain again and succeeds this time.
On top of the waterfall, Shiva discovers that the mask belongs to Avanthika (Tamannaah), a rebellious warrior whose group has indulged in a guerilla warfare against king Bhallala Deva / Pallvalathevan (Rana Daggubati) of the Mahishmati Kingdom. The group intends to rescue their former queen Devasena (Anushka Shetty) who has been chained in the kingdom for the past 25 years. Avanthika is given the opportunity to rescue the queen.""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I saw it at cinemas when it was first released i was so excited, This movie was like boring in lots of scenes but entertaining countable scenes,it's story is about four horsemen returns back after a year of the first one they start a new trick but unfortunately it fails and they get kidnapped in china so they meet Daniel Radcliffe so he wants from them to get an chip that can open any computer in the world ,screenplay was a mess and full of laziness in everything,if a movie is a sequel to another movie new chrarcters has to appear in this movie only 4 mew characters in it,now let's go to the acting jesse eisenberg was good Daniel Radcliffe was the best thing in this garbage,dave franco was the 2nd best thing i don't know why rufallo and harelson are in it, lizzy Caplan plays a new characters instead of Isla fisher but Isla Fisher was better cause there wasn't a package of acting on her lizzy Caplan was god but she was asked to make tricks and make people laugh,my problem with the first one was was in the end they used hypnotism in this one between every hypnotism and hypnotism there is hypnotism only the last 2 tricks were hood so as card scene woody harrleson acting as if he has a twin brother the 2nd worst thing after hypnotism he shouldn't have been in the movie i would give it 4.5/10 and i won't see it again i know that there will be a 3rd movie they should learn from their mi""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I have been a fan of a number of efforts from the Coen Brothers. Truthfully, even when they miss the mark, I am still able to find something worthwhile in the effort. The Big Lebowski is the exception to that rule. I originally saw it in theaters, where it played for an eyeblink and received mixed reviews. It was one of the few films my family has ever walked out on. I caught it later on cable and watched it to the end to see if I missed anything worthwhile, since it had inexplicably developed a cult following. The answer was a resounding no.
In what can complimentary be deemed a plot, the action centers on a zoned out bowler nicknamed The Dude, who somehow is mistaken for the title billionaire and gets pulled into what must be the most ill-conceived kidnapping plot in the history of cinema.
The ludicrous nature of the action would seem to recommend it to comedy, but the film is devoid of laughs. Unless the idea of a young woman's body parts being sent via mail is especially funny to you. The film introduces one needless and ostentatiously bizarre character after another in order to drum up some semblance of entertainment, but since none of them are important to the ""plot"" and have nothing of comical worth to contribute, it all seems a huge waste.
The dialogue is basically thinking up new ways to drop the f-bomb every 10 seconds. What passes for comedy is having the avuncular narrator (Sam Elliott) actually stop the proceedings at the midway point to good-naturedly ask The Dude why he has to to use such chronic foul language, to which The Dude responds with another f-bomb. How meta! How coy! And to rouse viewers lulled into a stupor, there are occasionally pointless unrelated fantasy sequences.
Julianne Moore shows up to no avail, speaking in some wacko old-Hollywood actress rhythm (think Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hudsucker Proxy). But whereas Leigh's impersonation had a legitimate reason to be, Moore's quite simply does not. Jeff Bridges can be an amazing actor and has contributed some wonderful cinematic contributions. This is not one of them. It seems incomprehensible that a following has cropped up around this character, because The Dude is little more than a cipher. The Dude is a completely passive non-entity, who spends the duration in a zoned out state. He seems to have nary an opinion on anything and it is inconceivable that anyone could mistake him for the title character, much less a sentient being at all. The plot careens him from one improbable and unfunny set-up to another eliciting little in the way of energy or emotion from him. He is just not remotely interesting here.
The only appealing or likable characters in the film are Elliott's narrator and Steve Buscemi, as a perpetually sunny and helpful fellow bowler. Alas, Buscemi is basically here to be bullied, brutalized, cursed at, and finally die. If most of the cast is awash in unlikable and appalling characters, the worst by far is John Goodman. The normally reliable Goodman is so over-the-top that his every moment on screen is like fingernails down a chalkboard. He plays The Dude's ""best friend"", a completely incompetent bully who inserts himself into everything to the detriment of all involved. He drops the f-bomb as much as The Dude and treats everyone around him with loud-mouthed contempt. He is an illiterate, detestable, brutish bore and the performance desecrates the screen, yet the filmmakers actually seem to think his antics are a riot. The film is pretty awful without Goodman's godawful work, but with his participation it descends even further into cinematic hell.
I cannot think of anything to say complimentary about the film and the fact that this abomination was vomited forth by otherwise talented filmmakers seems inexcusable.""An excellent film in every way. I cannot fault it on any level. A brilliant storyline, superbly acted and directed. Add to that the tremendous soundtrack and great cinematography and a film has been created which I will happily revisit time and time again. The wonderful Jeff Bridges, as he always seems to, gives real depth and integrity to his character. The relationship between Ben Foster and Chris Pine is always engaging. The brief, hilarious cameo scene from Margaret Bowman, an 88 year old actress, will forever after be etched in my memory. All in all, a real contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Win or lose, David Mackenzie has done us all a favour by reminding us that the best action movies don't rely on crash bang wallop pyrotechnics or high speed chases.""This film is about a man. A man who carries the burden of generations of hardship, who couldn't fulfill his own greatest dreams because of the oppressive context in which he lived and who tries to close himself off from the world with fences. Tragically, in closing himself off he loses site of the changing times, he boxes his loved-ones in, and he creates an oppressive environment that emulates everything he tried to guard against. The timeless question lies within this story (adapted from a Pulitzer winning play) is: can we hate a man like this? Or, when we consider his circumstances and trials, is he a hero to admire?
It's worth seeing and is worthy of praise. If not from the acting (particularly Viola's), from the captivating and poetic screenplay. Every word uttered seems calculated by the mind of a genius.""Loved it :)

Pad.A 9/10""If i could go higher than 10 i would!
After Resident Evil: Afterlife and Retribution, i was a little worried about this one (especially with it being the last), but...IT WAS THE BEST! I usually don't believe/agree with critics, so when they said ""They saved the best for last"" i was a little skeptical (although i wanted to believe them), but DAMN; they were right!
Literally from the start of the movie I knew it was gonna be not only better than the last 2, but a near-perfect (it ended up being perfect) movie! It had more suspense in the first few minutes (after it recapped the previous movies) than all the RE movies combined (that should at least please the fans of the games).
The movie was literally non-stop action/suspense, and unlike most such movies, it had a pretty damn good story too. It went into further detail and back-story than previous movies, and overall did a good job at ending the series (on a good note).
I can sit here and praise this movie all day, but several things would result: i'd bore you, i'd probably end up spoiling it, and then you probably wouldn't want to see it after all; so i'll leave you with this...
FINAL VERDICT: This is hands-down the BEST Resident Evil movie (and I thought nothing would top RE: Extinction)! It'll please fans of the games (me), and fans of action/survival/suspense movies (me & my dad). GO SEE IT""*** This review may contain spoilers *** I understand that there was a leaked video of animal abuse on the set, although actor Dennis Quaid who stars in the movie stated in interviews that the press is making more out of it then what it was. I believe him, cause the press at times has been known to stir the pot.
For anybody who has ever loved a dog, and has such devotion to a dog, is gonna love this movie. The story takes place through the 60's 70's 80's 90's and 2000's, through the point of view of a dogs narration(Josh Gad), has he lives so many different lives from so many different owners, and through the decades.
This was a very memorable film for the whole family, forget what you've heard, I see this film and form your opinion. Josh Gad is great has the voice of the dog, he's funny and never goes over the top. Dennis Quaid is good so was Brit Robertson, and Peggy Lipton when she was amount of times she was in it."
